The Higgs boson was the last missing component of the model. After observation of the Higgs boson, a measurement of the W boson mass provides a stringent test of the model. We measure the W boson mass, MW, using data corresponding to 8.8 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity collected in proton-antiproton collisions at a 1.96 tera-electron volt center-of-mass energy with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. A sample of approximately 4 million W boson candidates is used to obtain [Formula: see text], the precision of which exceeds that of all previous measurements combined (stat, statistical uncertainty; syst, systematic uncertainty; MeV, mega-electron volts; c, speed of light in a vacuum). This measurement is in significant tension with the standard model expectation."

        "abstract": "IntroductionThe traditional management paradigm for nonpalpable testis (NPT) has been that inguinal or scrotal exploration for a nubbin may be omitted when blind ending vessels are observed during diagnostic laparoscopy. Our aim was to examine whether blind ending vessels excluded the presence of a nubbin in a series of boys who underwent exploration in this setting.Materials and methodsUsing a surgical database and chart review, pre-pubertal boys (\u00e2\u2030\u00a412 years) with the diagnosis of undescended or atrophic testis who underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy for unilateral NPT between 2000 and 2015 were retrospectively identified. Physical exam, procedural and pathologic findings were confirmed by chart review.Results595 boys underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for NPT by 11 surgeons. Of these, 318 had an intra-abdominal testis and 18 underwent diagnostic laparoscopy alone. Of the remaining 259, 32 had an open internal ring and inguinal or scrotal exploration was performed. The remaining 227 with a closed ring comprised the cohort for our analysis, of whom 188 had vessels entering the ring, 36 had blind ending vessels, and in three the vessel status was unavailable. In the 188 boys with vessels entering the ring, 164 (87%) had a nubbin excised during inguinal or scrotal exploration, of which 93% were grossly identified as an atrophic testis. Pathology confirmed the presence of hemosiderin in 44% and calcifications in 54%. In the 36 boys with blind ending vessels, 26 (72%) had a nubbin excised during inguinal or scrotal exploration, of which 96% were grossly identified as an atrophic testis. Pathology confirmed hemosiderin in 54% and calcifications in 58%. All seven cases with both blind ending vas and vessels had an atrophic testis grossly identified. Of all 207 excised remnants in this series, nubbins with viable testicular elements (seminiferous tubules in 11, germ cells in two) were only excised during cases that reported a non-atretic vas or any vessels entering the internal ring.ConclusionIn this large multi-institutional series, blind ending vessels were associated with a nubbin noted during inguinal or scrotal exploration in the majority of cases. Based on this series if the surgeon's goal is to remove all nubbins, exploration is necessary regardless of vessel appearance. However, viable testicular elements were rarely identified and only when either a non-atretic vas or any vessels were observed to enter the ring."

In the present study, we extend those findings to the more translatable large animal porcine wound model and show that the combined treatment promotes wound reepithelialization in these excisional wounds by 40.2% and increases the CD31 immunostaining marker of angiogenesis compared with the matrix control, while maintaining an accumulated timolol plasma concentration below the clinically safe level of 0.3&nbsp;ng/mL after the 15-day course of topical application. Human GAPDH was not elevated in the day 15 wounds treated with MSC-containing device relative to wounds treated with matrix alone, indicating that the xenografted human MSCs in the treatment do not persist in these immune-competent animals after 15\u00e2\u20ac\u2030days. The work demonstrates the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment for improving healing in the clinically relevant porcine wound model."

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 11.7 fb-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. In this search, a dimensionless kinematic variable, \u00ce\u00b1T, is used to discriminate between events with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse energy. The search is based on an examination of the number of reconstructed jets per event, the scalar sum of transverse energies of these jets, and the number of these jets identified as originating from bottom quarks. No significant excess of events over the standard model expectation is found. Exclusion limits are set in the parameter space of simplified models, with a special emphasis on both compressed-spectrum scenarios and direct or gluino-induced production of third-generation squarks. For the case of gluino-mediated squark production, gluino masses up to 950-1125&nbsp;GeV are excluded depending on the assumed model. For the direct pair-production of squarks, masses up to 450&nbsp;GeV are excluded for a single light first- or second-generation squark, increasing to 600&nbsp;GeV for bottom squarks."

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe time to acquisition of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection following low-dose repeated rectal challenge correlated inversely with the number of transmitted/founder strains among macaques vaccinated with ALVAC-SIV/gp120 or gp120 alone. We determined if the ability of postvaccination, prechallenge sera to enhance SIVmac251 transcytosis across epithelial cells was associated with transmitted/founder strain number.MethodsTranscytosis was carried out by exposing sera and SIVmac251 to the apical surface of human endometrial carcinoma (HEC-1A) cells at pH 6.0 and 12 hours later quantifying virus in fluid bathing the basolateral cell surface (maintained at pH 7.4). These conditions allow Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn)-dependent shuttling of virus across cells.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between the amount of virus transcytosed and number of transmitted variants (R = 0.86, P < .0001). We also found that 4 animals who remained uninfected after repeated rectal challenges had lower serum transcytosis activity than did 19 animals who subsequently became infected (P = .003). Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated FcRn on columnar epithelial cells facing the lumen of the macaque rectum.ConclusionsVaccine-induced antibody capable of enhancing transcytosis in vitro via FcRn may play a role in determining transmitted/founder strain number and infection outcomes following in vivo challenge."

Upper endoscopy for tissue immunofluorescent antibody assay and disaccharide gut permeability/absorption studies were performed before and after 8 weeks of SBI to test mucosal immunity and gastrointestinal function. Blood was collected for markers of microbial translocation, inflammation, and collagen kinetics. A validated gastrointestinal questionnaire assessed changes in symptoms.ResultsAll eight participants experienced profound improvement in symptoms with reduced bowel movements/day (P\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.008) and improvements in stool consistency (P\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.008). Gut permeability was normal before and after the intervention, but D-xylose absorption increased in seven of eight participants. Mucosal CD4 lymphocyte densities increased by a median of 139.5\u00e2\u20ac\u0160cells/mm2 from 213 to 322\u00e2\u20ac\u0160cells/mm2 (P\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.016). Intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a marker of enterocyte damage, initially rose in seven of eight participants after 8 weeks (P\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.039), and then fell below baseline in four of five who continued receiving SBI (P\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.12). Baseline serum I-FABP levels were negatively correlated with subsequent rise in mucosal CD4 lymphocyte densities (r\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u0160-0.74, P\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.046).ConclusionSBI significantly increases intestinal mucosal CD4 lymphocyte counts, improves duodenal function, and showed evidence of promoting intestinal repair in the setting of HIV enteropathy."

We determined viral RNA (vRNA) levels and the envelope gene sequence in the SIVmac 251 viral populations in the genital tract and semen of 5 adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that were infected after experimental penile SIV infection. Paired blood and semen samples were collected from 1-9 weeks after infection and the monkeys were necropsied eleven weeks after infection. The axillary lymph nodes, testes, epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicles were collected and vRNA levels and single-genome analysis of the SIVmac251 env variants was performed. At the time of semen collection, blood vRNA levels were between 3.09 and 7.85 log10 vRNA copies/ml plasma. SIV RNA was found in the axillary lymph nodes of all five monkeys and in 3 of 5 monkeys, all tissues examined were vRNA positive. In these 3 monkeys, vRNA levels (log10 SIVgag copies/ug of total tissue RNA) in the axillary lymph node (6.48 \u00c2\u00b1 0.50) were significantly higher than in the genital tract tissues: testis (3.67 \u00c2\u00b1 2.16; p<0.05), epididymis (3.08 \u00c2\u00b1 1.19; p<0.0001), prostate (3.36 \u00c2\u00b1 1.30; p<0.01), and seminal vesicle (2.67 \u00c2\u00b1 1.50; p<0.0001). Comparison of the SIVmac251 env viral populations in blood plasma, systemic lymph node, and genital tract tissues was performed in two of the macaques. Visual inspection of the Neighbor-Joining phylograms revealed that in both animals, all the sequences were generally distributed evenly among all tissue compartments. Importantly, viral populations in the genital tissues were not distinct from those in the systemic tissues. Our findings demonstrate striking similarity in the viral populations in the blood and male genital tract tissues within 3 months of penile SIV transmission."

Fifty-one patients received freeze-dried allograft (106 total spinal levels) and 28 patients received fresh-frozen allograft (50 total spinal levels). Fusion was assessed through trabecular bridging on follow-up anterior-posterior/lateral radiographs. Trabecular bridging was assessed on the superior and inferior borders of each spinal level and given a fusion grade. Complete fusion is defined as >50% bridging between superior and inferior borders of the bone graft; union is complete fusion in <26 weeks; delayed union is complete fusion after 26 weeks; and fibrous union is <50% bridging at \u00e2\u2030\u00a51 borders over 52 weeks.ResultsAll spinal levels reached complete fusion for both graft types. Of the freeze-dried treated cervical spinal levels, 77.35% (82/106) reached union (adequate trabecular bridging within 6 months) without delay compared with 80% (35/50) for the fresh-frozen bone graft group (P&nbsp;= 0.85). There was no significant difference in time-to-fusion analysis and no significant association between delayed union and any patient factors. In assessing Neck Disability Index (NDI), freeze-dried allografts did show a significantly greater decrease in NDI scores at 6 months (P&nbsp;= 0.03). At the 1 year follow-up, improvements in NDI were consistent in both allografts (P&nbsp;= 0.9647).ConclusionsFrom this study, freeze-dried and fresh-frozen allografts showed comparable rates of union, and both allografts can be used interchangeably for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion."

We previously identified a 9-amino-acid cyclic peptide LXY30 for detecting \u00ce\u00b13\u00ce\u00b21 integrin on the surface of live tumor cells. This study was undertaken to characterize LXY30 in the detection, cellular function, imaging, and targeted delivery of in vitro and in vivo non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models.MethodsThe whole-cell binding assay was performed by incubating NSCLC cells, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with TentaGel resin beads coated with LXY30. In this study, we defined the nanosize EVs as exosomes, which were characterized by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and Western blots. The function of LXY30 was determined by modulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway by growth inhibition and Western blots. For in vivo biodistribution, mice bearing subcutaneous and intracranial NSCLC xenograft tumors were administrated intraveneously with LXY30-biotin/streptavidin-Cy5.5 complex and then analyzed for in vivo and ex vivo optical imaging and histopathology.ResultsWe showed that LXY30 specifically and sensitively detected \u00ce\u00b13\u00ce\u00b21 integrin-expressing NSCLC cells and tumor-derived exosomes. Tumor DNA isolated from LXY30-enriched plasma exosomes might be used to detect driver oncogenic mutations in patients with metastatic NSCLC. LXY30 only enriches tumor cells but not neutrophils, macrophages, or monocytes in the malignant pleural effusion of NSCLC patients for detecting genomic alterations by next-generation sequencing. LXY30 detected increased \u00ce\u00b13\u00ce\u00b21 integrin expression on the EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to erlotinib compared to parental erlotinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. We further showed that LXY30 modulated the EGFR signaling pathway independently from another peptide ligand LXW64 targeting \u00ce\u00b1v\u00ce\u00b23 integrin in erlotinib-resistant, EGFR-mutant H1975 cells. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed high \u00ce\u00b13 integrin expression was associated with poor prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma. LXY30-biotin/streptavidin-Cy5.5 complex had higher uptakes in the subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts of various \u00ce\u00b13\u00ce\u00b21 integrin-expressing lung adenocarcinoma and patient-derived lung squamous cell carcinoma xenografts while sparing the surrounding normal tissues.ConclusionLXY30 is a promising peptide for the cancer diagnosis and in vivo targeted delivery of imaging agents and cancer drugs in NSCLC, independent of histology and tumor genotype."

From this analysis, we identified number of over-represented motifs. Among these, major critical motifs were identified using a position filter. We used a model based on uniform distribution and the z-scores derived from this model to describe position bias. Interestingly, many motifs showed position bias towards the transcription start site. We extended this model to show biased distribution of motifs in the genomes of both A. thaliana and rice. We also used MotifIndexer to identify conserved motifs in co-expressed gene groups from two Arabidopsis species, A. thaliana and A. lyrata.

However, requirements of toxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in APEX-based PL, longer incubation time with biotin (16-24 h), and higher incubation temperature (37 \u00c2\u00b0C) in BioID-based PL severely limit their applications in plants. The recently described TurboID-based PL addresses many limitations of BioID and APEX. TurboID allows rapid proximity labeling of proteins in just 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2030min under room temperature (RT) conditions. Although the utility of TurboID has been demonstrated in animal models, we recently showed that TurboID-based PL performs better in plants compared to BioID for labeling of proteins that are proximal to a protein of interest. Provided here is a step-by-step protocol for the identification of protein interaction partners using the N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein family as a model. The method describes vector construction, agroinfiltration of protein expression constructs, biotin treatment, protein extraction and desalting, quantification, and enrichment of the biotinylated proteins by affinity purification.

However, our knowledge about plant autophagy remains limited, and how this fundamental cellular process is involved in plant immunity is still somewhat perplexing. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the positive and negative roles of autophagy in plant immunity and how different microbes exploit this process to their own advantage. The dualistic role of autophagy in plant immunity emphasizes that much remains to be explored in this area."

        "abstract": "To discern virulent from innocuous microbes, the innate immune system senses events associated with bacterial access to immunoprivileged sites such as the host cell cytosol. One such pathway is triggered by the cytosolic delivery of flagellin, the major subunit of the flagellum, by bacterial secretion systems. This leads to inflammasome activation and subsequent proinflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) of the infected phagocyte. In this study, we demonstrate that the causative agent of typhoid fever, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, can partially subvert this critical innate immune recognition event. The transcriptional regulator TviA, which is absent from Salmonella serovars associated with human gastroenteritis, repressed the expression of flagellin during infection of human macrophage-like (THP-1) cells. This mechanism allowed S. Typhi to dampen inflammasome activation, leading to reduced interleukin-1\u00ce\u00b2 (IL-1\u00ce\u00b2) secretion and diminished cell death. Likewise, the introduction of the tviA gene in nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reduced flagellin-induced pyroptosis. These data suggest that gene regulation of virulence factors enables S. Typhi to evade innate immune recognition by concealing a pathogen-induced process from being sensed by the inflammasome."

Associated with this shift in microbiota composition is a profound change in the metabolic landscape of the intestine. It is unclear how changes in metabolite availability during gut inflammation impact microbial and host physiology.ResultsWe investigated microbial and host lactate metabolism in murine models of infectious and non-infectious colitis. During inflammation-associated dysbiosis, lactate levels in the gut lumen increased. The disease-associated spike in lactate availability was significantly reduced in mice lacking the lactate dehydrogenase A subunit in intestinal epithelial cells. Commensal E. coli and pathogenic Salmonella, representative Enterobacteriaceae family members, utilized lactate via the respiratory L-lactate dehydrogenase LldD to increase fitness. Furthermore, mice lacking the lactate dehydrogenase A subunit in intestinal epithelial cells exhibited lower levels of inflammation in a model of non-infectious colitis.ConclusionsThe release of lactate by intestinal epithelial cells during gut inflammation impacts the metabolism of gut-associated microbial communities. These findings suggest that during intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis, changes in metabolite availability can perpetuate colitis-associated disturbances of microbiota composition. Video Abstract."

        "abstract": "Magnetization reversal in exchange-spring magnet films has been investigated by a first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique and vector magnetometry. In Fe/epitaxial-SmCo films, the reversal proceeds by a reversible rotation of the Fe soft layer, followed by an irreversible switching of the SmCo hard layer. The switching fields are clearly manifested by separate steps in both longitudinal and transverse hysteresis loops, as well as sharp boundaries in the FORC distribution. In FeNi/polycrystalline-FePt films, particularly with thin FeNi, the switching fields are masked by the smooth and step-free major loop. However, the FORC diagram still displays a distinct onset of irreversible switching and transverse hysteresis loops exhibit a pair of peaks, whose amplitude is larger than the maximum possible contribution from the FeNi layer alone. This suggests that the FeNi and FePt layers reverse in a continuous process via a vertical spiral. The successive versus continuous rotation of the soft/hard layer system is primarily due to the different crystal structure of the hard layer, which results in different anisotropies."

Prerequisite are systems exhibiting skyrmion lattices at ambient conditions, which have been elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate the realization of artificial Bloch skyrmion lattices over extended areas in their ground state at room temperature by patterning asymmetric magnetic nanodots with controlled circularity on an underlayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Polarity is controlled by a tailored magnetic field sequence and demonstrated in magnetometry measurements. The vortex structure is imprinted from the dots into the interfacial region of the underlayer via suppression of the PMA by a critical ion-irradiation step. The imprinted skyrmion lattices are identified directly with polarized neutron reflectometry and confirmed by magnetoresistance measurements. Our results demonstrate an exciting platform to explore room-temperature ground-state skyrmion lattices."

Experiments verifying the orientation of the interfacial DMI vector remain rare, in part due to the difficulty of separating vector components of DMI. In this study, Fe/Ni bilayers and Co/Ni multilayers were deposited epitaxially onto Cu(001) and Pt(111) substrates, respectively. By tailoring the effective anisotropy, spin reorientation transitions (SRTs) are employed to probe the orientation of the DMI vector by measuring the spin structure of domain walls on both sides of the SRTs. The interfacial DMI is found to be sufficiently strong to stabilize chiral N\u00c3\u00a9el walls in the out-of-plane magnetized regimes, while achiral N\u00c3\u00a9el walls are observed in the in-plane magnetized regimes.

Here, we demonstrate room-temperature voltage-driven nitrogen transport (i.e., nitrogen magneto-ionics) by electrolyte-gating of a CoN film. Nitrogen magneto-ionics in CoN is compared to oxygen magneto-ionics in Co3O4. Both materials are nanocrystalline (face-centered cubic structure) and show reversible voltage-driven ON-OFF ferromagnetism. In contrast to oxygen, nitrogen transport occurs uniformly creating a plane-wave-like migration front, without assistance of diffusion channels. Remarkably, nitrogen magneto-ionics requires lower threshold voltages and exhibits enhanced rates and cyclability. This is due to the lower activation energy for ion diffusion and the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen. These results may open new avenues in applications such as brain-inspired computing or iontronics in general."

Effective therapy is limited to a single drug for treatment of ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2, necessitating animal disease models to facilitate further therapeutic development. Murine models are advantageous for therapeutic development due to easy genetic manipulation and rapid breeding, however appropriate genetic models need to be identified and characterized before being used for therapy testing. To date, murine models of ocular disease associated with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8 have only been characterized in motor neuron degeneration mice.MethodsCln8-/- mice were produced by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. Ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography, electroretinography, and ocular histology was performed on Cln8-/- mice and controls at 16 weeks of age. Quantification of all retinal layers, retinal pigmented epithelium, and the choriocapillaris was performed using images acquired with ocular coherence tomography and planimetry of histologic sections. Necropsy was performed to investigate concurrent systemic abnormalities. Clinical correlation with human patients with CLN8-associated retinopathy is provided.ResultsRetinal degeneration characterized by retinal pigment epithelium mottling, scattered drusen, and retinal vascular attenuation was noted in all Cln8-/- mice. Loss of inner and outer photoreceptor segment demarcation was noted on optical coherence tomography, with significant thinning of the whole retina (P=1e-9), outer nuclear layer (P=1e-9), and combined photoreceptor segments (P=1e-9). A global reduction in scotopic and photopic electroretinographic waveforms was noted in all Cln8-/- mice. Slight thickening of the inner plexiform layer (P=0.02) and inner nuclear layer (P=0.004), with significant thinning of the whole retina (P=0.03), outer nuclear layer (P=0.01), and outer photoreceptor segments (P=0.001) was appreciated on histologic sections. Scattered lipid vacuoles were noted in splenic red pulp of all Cln8-/- mice, though no gross systemic abnormalities were detected on necropsy. Retinal findings are consistent with those seen in patients with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8.ConclusionsThis study provides detailed clinical characterization of retinopathy in adult Cln8-/- mice. Findings suggest that Cln8-/- mice may provide a useful murine model for development of novel therapeutics needed for treating ocular disease in patients with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8."

In the last decade, V. botryosa has been associated with emergent systemic fungal infections in aquatic animals, including cultured sturgeon (Acipenser spp.), captive amphibians, and wild reptiles. Recently, repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting has demonstrated intraspecific variability among V. botryosa isolates from different clinically affected hosts and geographic regions. However, little is known regarding the pathogenic potential of the different genetic clades, and no mammalian model currently exists to investigate V. botryosa phaeohyphomycosis. In this study, we inoculated immunocompetent heterozygotic (nu/+) and immunodeficient homozygotic (nu/nu) Hsd:Athymic Nude-Fox1nu mice subcutaneously or through orogastric gavage with 1 of 3 representative V. botryosa strains that had been recovered from white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), and human hosts and typed by using rep-PCR analysis. Daily mortality and morbidity were recorded, and dissemination of the fungus was investigated through culture of splenic samples and histologic analysis of the injection site, regional lymph nodes, salivary gland, spleen, liver, mesenteric lymph node, and gastrointestinal tract. No differences in survival, fungal burden, or dissemination were observed between fungal strains, routes of inoculation, or host immune status. Fungal infection was observed after subcutaneous inoculation only, was localized to the inoculation site, and was identified in both nu/nu and nu/+ mice. Fungal strain variability was not associated with virulence in a murine model of infection, and this novel mouse model of V. botryosa phaeohyphomycosis recapitulates the human clinical condition."

The use of ANS is expanding to include new indications and gestational ages, although the recommended dosing was never optimized. The most widely used treatment is two intramuscular doses of a 1:1 mixture of betamethasone-phosphate (Beta-P) and betamethasone-acetate (Beta-Ac) - the clinical drug. We tested in a primate model the efficacy of the slow release Beta-Ac alone for enhancing fetal lung maturation and to reduce fetal corticosteroid exposure and potential toxic effects. Pregnant rhesus macaques at 127 days of gestation (80% of term) were treated with either the clinical drug (0.25\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/kg) or Beta-Ac (0.125\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/kg). Beta-Ac alone increased lung compliance and surfactant concentration in the fetal lung equivalently to the clinical drug. By transcriptome analyses the early suppression of genes associated with immune responses and developmental pathways were less affected by Beta-Ac than the clinical drug. Promoter and regulatory analysis prediction identified differentially expressed genes targeted by the glucocorticoid receptor in the lung. At 5 days the clinical drug suppressed genes associated with neuronal development and differentiation in the fetal hippocampus compared to control, while low dose Beta-Ac alone did not. A low dose ANS treatment with Beta-Ac should be assessed for efficacy in human trials."

        "abstract": "Background and purpose5-Oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), acting via the OXE receptor, is unique among 5-lipoxygenase products in its ability to directly induce human eosinophil migration, suggesting its involvement in eosinophilic diseases. To address this hypothesis, we synthesized selective indole-based OXE receptor antagonists. Because rodents lack an OXE receptor orthologue, we sought to determine whether these antagonists could attenuate allergen-induced skin eosinophilia in sensitized monkeys.Experimental approachIn a pilot study, cynomolgus monkeys with environmentally acquired sensitivity to Ascaris suum were treated orally with the \"first-generation\" OXE antagonist 230 prior to intradermal injection of 5-oxo-ETE or Ascaris extract. Eosinophils were evaluated in punch biopsy samples taken 6 or 24&nbsp;hr later. We subsequently treated captive-bred rhesus monkeys sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) allergen with a more recently developed OXE antagonist, S-Y048, and evaluated its effects on dermal eosinophilia induced by either 5-oxo-ETE or HDM.Key resultsIn a pilot experiment, both 5-oxo-ETE and Ascaris extract induced dermal eosinophilia in cynomolgus monkeys, which appeared to be reduced by 230. Subsequently, we found that the related OXE antagonist S-Y048 is a highly potent inhibitor of 5-oxo-ETE-induced activation of rhesus monkey eosinophils in vitro and has a half-life in plasma of about 6&nbsp;hr after oral administration. S-Y048 significantly inhibited eosinophil infiltration into the skin in response to both intradermally administered 5-oxo-ETE and HDM.Conclusions and implications5-Oxo-ETE may play an important role in allergen-induced eosinophilia. Blocking its effects with S-Y048 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for eosinophilic diseases."

The objective was to evaluate the natural history of sperm concentration and selected hormonal parameters in patients with testicular cancer treated with orchiectomy and radiotherapy.Methods and materialsOf a total of 207 patients enrolled on SWOG 8711, 53 pure seminoma patients were identified who were treated with orchiectomy and radiotherapy only. Sperm concentration, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and sexual satisfaction scores were the main parameters followed.ResultsA fraction of the patients were infertile prior to receiving radiotherapy. Our analysis indicates that incidental radiation dose to the remaining testicle affects time to recovery of fertility, and at an aggregate level, changes in FSH mirror changes in sperm concentration over time. This phenomenon is the same as that described in patients free from testicular cancer. These men evaluated their sexual activity as good after orchidectomy.ConclusionOur data support the use of clamshell-type testicular shields as a means of providing maximum protection to the remaining testicle."

        "abstract": "For an excitable cell to function properly, a precise number of ion channel proteins need to be trafficked to distinct locations on the cell surface membrane, through a network and anchoring activity of cytoskeletal proteins. Not surprisingly, mutations in anchoring proteins have profound effects on membrane excitability. Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (KCa2 or SK) have been shown to play critical roles in shaping the cardiac atrial action potential profile. Here, we demonstrate that filamin A, a cytoskeletal protein, augments the trafficking of SK2 channels in cardiac myocytes. The trafficking of SK2 channel is Ca(2+)-dependent. Further, the Ca(2+) dependence relies on another channel-interacting protein, \u00ce\u00b1-actinin2, revealing a tight, yet intriguing, assembly of cytoskeletal proteins that orchestrate membrane expression of SK2 channels in cardiac myocytes. We assert that changes in SK channel trafficking would significantly alter atrial action potential and consequently atrial excitability. Identification of therapeutic targets to manipulate the subcellular localization of SK channels is likely to be clinically efficacious. The findings here may transcend the area of SK2 channel studies and may have implications not only in cardiac myocytes but in other types of excitable cells."

However, achieving selectivity for specific ion channel subtypes with small-molecule drugs has been challenging, and there currently is a growing trend to target ion channels with biologics. One approach is to improve the pharmacokinetics of existing or novel venom-derived peptides. In parallel, after initial studies with polyclonal antibodies demonstrated the technical feasibility of inhibiting channel function with antibodies, multiple preclinical programmes are now using the full spectrum of available technologies to generate conventional monoclonal and engineered antibodies or nanobodies against extracellular loops of ion channels.

Gating of the hERG channel is characterized by rapid, voltage-dependent, C-type inactivation, which blocks ion conduction and is suggested to involve constriction of the selectivity filter. Mutations S620T and S641A/T within the selectivity filter region of hERG have been shown to alter the voltage dependence of channel inactivation. Because hERG channel blockade is implicated in drug-induced arrhythmias associated with both the open and inactivated states, we used Rosetta to simulate the effects of hERG S620T and S641A/T mutations to elucidate conformational changes associated with hERG channel inactivation and differences in drug binding between the two states. Rosetta modeling of the S641A fast-inactivating mutation revealed a lateral shift of the F627 side chain in the selectivity filter into the central channel axis along the ion conduction pathway and the formation of four lateral fenestrations in the pore. Rosetta modeling of the non-inactivating mutations S620T and S641T suggested a potential molecular mechanism preventing F627 side chain from shifting into the ion conduction pathway during the proposed inactivation process. Furthermore, we used Rosetta docking to explore the binding mechanism of highly selective and potent hERG blockers - dofetilide, terfenadine, and E4031. Our structural modeling correlates well with much, but not all, existing experimental evidence involving interactions of hERG blockers with key residues in hERG pore and reveals potential molecular mechanisms of ligand interactions with hERG in an inactivated state."

Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is a key enzyme in the \u00ce\u00b2-AR pathway that catalyzes the production of cAMP. There are current gaps in our knowledge regarding the dominant AC isoforms and the specific roles of Ca2+-activated ACs in the SAN. The current study tests the hypothesis that distinct AC isoforms are preferentially expressed in the SAN and compartmentalize within microdomains to orchestrate heart rate regulation during \u00ce\u00b2-AR signaling. In contrast to atrial and ventricular myocytes, SAN cells express a diverse repertoire of ACs, with ACI as the predominant Ca2+-activated isoform. Although ACI-KO (ACI-/-) mice exhibit normal cardiac systolic or diastolic function, they experience SAN dysfunction. Similarly, SAN-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene silencing of ACI results in sinus node dysfunction. Mechanistically, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 4 (HCN4) channels form functional microdomains almost exclusively with ACI, while ryanodine receptor and L-type Ca2+ channels likely compartmentalize with ACI and other AC isoforms. In contrast, there were no significant differences in T-type Ca2+ and Na+ currents at baseline or after \u00ce\u00b2-AR stimulation between WT and ACI-/- SAN cells. Due to its central characteristic feature as a Ca2+-activated isoform, ACI plays a unique role in sustaining the rise of local cAMP and heart rates during \u00ce\u00b2-AR stimulation. The findings provide insights into the critical roles of the Ca2+-activated isoform of AC in sustaining SAN automaticity that is distinct from contractile cardiomyocytes."

        "abstract": "ObjectiveTo examine whether longitudinal urinary incontinence (UI) characteristics, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and education were associated with UI treatment-seeking in a prospective cohort of community-dwelling midlife women.MethodsWe analyzed data from 9 years of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. The study asked participants reporting at least monthly UI about seeking treatment for their UI at baseline and in visit years 7, 8, and 9. Our main covariates included self-reported race or ethnicity, income, level of difficulty paying for basics, and education level. We used multiple logistic regression to examine associations between demographic, psychosocial, and longitudinal UI characteristics and whether women sought UI treatment. We explored interactions by race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status measures, and education level.ResultsA total of 1,550 women (68% of women with UI) reported seeking treatment for UI over the 9 years of this study. In multivariable analyses, women had higher odds of seeking treatment when UI in the year before seeking treatment was more frequent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-8.67) and more bothersome (adjusted OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18), with longer symptom duration, and with worsening UI symptoms (adjusted OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.01-3.04). Women who saw physicians regularly, had more preventive women's health visits, or both were more likely to seek UI treatment (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07, 1.30). Race or ethnicity, socioeconomic measures, and education were not significantly related to seeking treatment for UI.ConclusionWe found no evidence of racial or ethnic, socioeconomic, or education level disparities in UI treatment-seeking. Rather, longitudinal UI characteristics were most strongly associated with treatment-seeking behavior in midlife women.Level of evidenceII."

        "abstract": "BackgroundHierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is a widely used classificatory technique in many areas of scientific knowledge. Applications usually yield a dendrogram from an HCA run over a given data set, using a grouping algorithm and a similarity measure. However, even when such parameters are fixed, ties in proximity (i.e. two equidistant clusters from a third one) may produce several different dendrograms, having different possible clustering patterns (different classifications). This situation is usually disregarded and conclusions are based on a single result, leading to questions concerning the permanence of clusters in all the resulting dendrograms; this happens, for example, when using HCA for grouping molecular descriptors to select that less similar ones in QSAR studies.ResultsRepresenting dendrograms in graph theoretical terms allowed us to introduce four measures of cluster frequency in a canonical way, and use them to calculate cluster frequencies over the set of all possible dendrograms, taking all ties in proximity into account. A toy example of well separated clusters was used, as well as a set of 1666 molecular descriptors calculated for a group of molecules having hepatotoxic activity to show how our functions may be used for studying the effect of ties in HCA analysis. Such functions were not restricted to the tie case; the possibility of using them to derive cluster stability measurements on arbitrary sets of dendrograms having the same leaves is discussed, e.g. dendrograms from variations of HCA parameters. It was found that ties occurred frequently, some yielding tens of thousands of dendrograms, even for small data sets.ConclusionsOur approach was able to detect trends in clustering patterns by offering a simple way of measuring their frequency, which is often very low. This would imply, that inferences and models based on descriptor classifications (e.g. QSAR) are likely to be biased, thereby requiring an assessment of their reliability. Moreover, any classification of molecular descriptors is likely to be far from unique. Our results highlight the need for evaluating the effect of ties on clustering patterns before classification results can be used accurately.Graphical abstractFour cluster contrast functions identifying statistically sound clusters within dendrograms considering ties in proximity."

To control for potential confounding effects of diet- or microbiome-derived molecules on the systemic metabolome, sampling was during a tightly-controlled feeding test week paradigm. Pairwise and multivariate analysis revealed intervention- and insulin-sensitivity associated: (1) Changes in plasma xeno-metabolites (\"non-self\" metabolites of dietary or gut microbial origin) following an oral glucose tolerance test (e.g. higher post-OGTT propane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate [tricarballylic acid]) or in the overnight-fasted state (e.g., lower \u00ce\u00b3-tocopherol); (2) Increased indices of saturated very long chain fatty acid elongation capacity; (3) Increased post-OGTT \u00ce\u00b1-ketoglutaric acid (\u00ce\u00b1-KG), fasting \u00ce\u00b1-KG inversely correlated with Matsuda index, and altered patterns of malate, pyruvate and glutamine hypothesized to stem from improved mitochondrial efficiency and more robust oxidation of glucose. The results support a working model in which improved metabolic health modifies host metabolism in parallel with altering systemic exposure to xeno-metabolites. This highlights that interpretations regarding the origins of peripheral blood or urinary \"signatures\" of insulin resistance and metabolic health must consider the potentially important contribution of gut-derived metabolites toward the host's metabolome."

Here we define three DUF89 subfamilies (I, II, and III), with subfamily II being split into stand-alone proteins and proteins fused to pantothenate kinase (PanK). We demonstrated that DUF89 proteins have metal-dependent phosphatase activity against reactive phosphoesters or their damaged forms, notably sugar phosphates (subfamilies II and III), phosphopantetheine and its S-sulfonate or sulfonate (subfamily II-PanK fusions), and nucleotides (subfamily I). Genetic and comparative genomic data strongly associated DUF89 genes with phosphoester metabolism. The crystal structure of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) subfamily III protein YMR027W revealed a novel phosphatase active site with fructose 6-phosphate and Mg(2+) bound near conserved signature residues Asp254 and Asn255 that are critical for activity. These findings indicate that DUF89 proteins are previously unrecognized hydrolases whose characteristic in vivo function is to limit potentially harmful buildups of normal or damaged phosphometabolites."

We show how seemingly straightforward sample preparation methods can introduce systematic errors (e.g., owing to interconversion among metabolites) and how proper selection of quenching solvent (e.g., acidic acetonitrile:methanol:water) can mitigate such problems. We discuss the specific strengths, pitfalls, and best practices for each common analytical platform: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and enzyme assays.

Here, we define a salvage pathway for 5-deoxyribose in bacteria, consisting of phosphorylation, isomerization, and aldol cleavage steps. Analysis of bacterial genomes uncovers widespread, unassigned three-gene clusters specifying a putative kinase, isomerase, and sugar phosphate aldolase. We show that the enzymes encoded by the Bacillus thuringiensis cluster, acting together in vitro, convert 5-deoxyribose successively to 5-deoxyribose 1-phosphate, 5-deoxyribulose 1-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate plus acetaldehyde. Deleting the isomerase decreases the 5-deoxyribulose 1-phosphate pool size, and deleting either the isomerase or the aldolase increases susceptibility to 5-deoxyribose. The substrate preference of the aldolase is unique among family members, and the X-ray structure reveals an unusual manganese-dependent enzyme.

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in men over 50 years of age, and there is a characteristic marked decrease in Zn content in the malignant prostate cells. The cause and consequences of this loss have thus far been unknown. We found that in middle-aged rats a Zn-deficient diet reduces prostatic Zn levels (P = 0.025), increases cellular proliferation, and induces an inflammatory phenotype with COX-2 overexpression. This hyperplastic/inflammatory prostate has a human prostate cancer-like microRNA profile, with up-regulation of the Zn-homeostasis-regulating miR-183-96-182 cluster (fold change = 1.41-2.38; P = 0.029-0.0003) and down-regulation of the Zn importer ZIP1 (target of miR-182), leading to a reduction of prostatic Zn. This inverse relationship between miR-182 and ZIP1 also occurs in human prostate cancer tissue, which is known for Zn loss. The discovery that the Zn-depleted middle-aged rat prostate has a metabolic phenotype resembling that of human prostate cancer, with a 10-fold down-regulation of citric acid (P = 0.0003), links citrate reduction directly to prostatic Zn loss, providing the underlying mechanism linking dietary Zn deficiency with miR-183-96-182 overexpression, ZIP1 down-regulation, prostatic Zn loss, and the resultant citrate down-regulation, changes mimicking features of human prostate cancer. Thus, dietary Zn deficiency during rat middle age produces changes that mimic those of human prostate carcinoma and may increase the risk for prostate cancer, supporting the need for assessment of Zn supplementation in its prevention."

        "abstract": "Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of inherited diseases with variable incidences. IEMs are caused by disrupting enzyme activities in specific metabolic pathways by genetic mutations, either directly or indirectly by cofactor deficiencies, causing altered levels of compounds associated with these pathways. While IEMs may present with multiple overlapping symptoms and metabolites, early and accurate diagnosis of IEMs is critical for the long-term health of affected subjects. The prevalence of IEMs differs between countries, likely because different IEM classifications and IEM screening methods are used. Currently, newborn screening programs exclusively use targeted metabolic assays that focus on limited panels of compounds for selected IEM diseases. Such targeted approaches face the problem of false negative and false positive diagnoses that could be overcome if metabolic screening adopted analyses of a broader range of analytes. Hence, we here review the prospects of using untargeted metabolomics for IEM screening. Untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics do not rely on predefined target lists and can detect as many metabolites as possible in a sample, allowing to screen for many metabolic pathways simultaneously. Examples are given for nontargeted analyses of IEMs, and prospects and limitations of different metabolomics methods are discussed. We conclude that dedicated studies are needed to compare accuracy and robustness of targeted and untargeted methods with respect to widening the scope of IEM diagnostics."

        "abstract": "IntroductionDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a widely used solvent to dissolve hydrophobic substances for clinical uses and experimental in vivo purposes. While usually regarded safe, our prior studies suggest changes to behavior following DMSO exposure. We therefore evaluated the effects of a five-day, short-term exposure to DMSO on postnatal infant rats (P6-10).MethodsDMSO was intraperitoneally injected for five days at 0.2, 2.0, and 4.0&nbsp;ml/kg body mass. One cohort of animals was sacrificed 24&nbsp;hr after DMSO exposure to analyze the neurometabolic changes in four brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum) by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. A second cohort of animals was used to analyze chronic alterations to behavior and pathological changes to glia and neuronal cells later in life (P21-P40).Results164 metabolites, including key regulatory molecules (retinoic acid, orotic acid, adrenic acid, and hypotaurine), were found significantly altered by DMSO exposure in at least one of the brain regions at P11 (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;.05). Behavioral tests showed significant hypoactive behavior and decreased social habits to the 2.0 and 4.0&nbsp;ml DMSO/kg groups (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;.01). Significant increases in number of microglia and astrocytes at P40 were observed in the 4.0&nbsp;ml DMSO/kg group (at p&nbsp;<&nbsp;.015.) CONCLUSIONS: Despite short-term exposure at low, putatively nontoxic concentrations, DMSO led to changes in behavior and social preferences, chronic alterations in glial cells, and changes in essential regulatory brain metabolites. The chronic neurological effects of DMSO exposure reported here raise concerns about its neurotoxicity and consequent safety in human medical applications and clinical trials."

        "abstract": "It is unknown whether indoles, metabolites of tryptophan that are derived entirely from bacterial metabolism in the gut, are associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Serum samples (baseline, 12&nbsp;weeks) were drawn from participants (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030196) randomized to treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), escitalopram, or duloxetine for major depressive disorder. Baseline indoxyl sulfate abundance was positively correlated with severity of psychic anxiety and total anxiety and with resting state functional connectivity to a network that processes aversive stimuli (which includes the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC-FC), bilateral anterior insula, right anterior midcingulate cortex, and the right premotor areas). The relation between indoxyl sulfate and psychic anxiety was mediated only through the metabolite's effect on the SCC-FC with the premotor area. Baseline indole abundances were unrelated to post-treatment outcome measures, and changes in symptoms were not correlated with changes in indole concentrations. These results suggest that CBT and antidepressant medications relieve anxiety via mechanisms unrelated to modulation of indoles derived from gut microbiota; it remains possible that treatment-related improvement stems from their impact on other aspects of the gut microbiome. A peripheral gut microbiome-derived metabolite was associated with altered neural processing and with psychiatric symptom (anxiety) in humans, which provides further evidence that gut microbiome disruption can contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders that may require different therapeutic approaches.

Several genes known to have such functions were identified and experimentally validated, including 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase, coenzyme A (CoA) disulfide reductase, and certain hydrolases. Furthermore, we discovered that an enigmatic YqeK hydrolase domain fused to NadD has a novel proofreading function in NAD synthesis and could double as a MutT-like sanitizing enzyme for the nucleotide pool. Finally, we combined metabolomics and cheminformatics approaches to extend the core metabolic map of JCVI-Syn3A to include promiscuous enzymatic reactions and spontaneous side reactions. This extension revealed that several key metabolite damage control systems remain to be identified in JCVI-Syn3A, such as that for methylglyoxal. IMPORTANCE Metabolite damage and repair mechanisms are being increasingly recognized. We present here compelling genetic and biochemical evidence for the universal importance of these mechanisms by demonstrating that stripping a genome down to its barest essentials leaves metabolite damage control systems in place. Furthermore, our metabolomic and cheminformatic results point to the existence of a network of metabolite damage and damage control reactions that extends far beyond the corners of it that have been characterized so far. In sum, there can be little room left to doubt that metabolite damage and the systems that counter it are mainstream metabolic processes that cannot be separated from life itself."

Here, we sought to identify fasting plasma lipids associated with risk of CKD among American Indians in the Strong Heart Family Study, a large-scale community-dwelling of individuals, followed by replication in Mexican Americans from the San Antonio Family Heart Study and Caucasians from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study. We also performed repeated measurement analysis to examine the temporal relationship between the change in the lipidome and change in kidney function between baseline and follow-up of about five years apart. Network analysis was conducted to identify differential lipid classes associated with risk of CKD. In the discovery cohort, we found that higher baseline level of multiple lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids and sphingolipids, was significantly associated with increased risk of CKD, independent of age, sex, body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Many lipid species were replicated in at least one external cohort at the individual lipid species and/or the class level. Longitudinal change in the plasma lipidome was significantly associated with change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate after adjusting for covariates, baseline lipids and the baseline rate. Network analysis identified distinct lipidomic signatures differentiating high from low-risk groups. Thus, our results demonstrated that disturbed lipid metabolism precedes the onset of CKD. These findings shed light on the mechanisms linking dyslipidemia to CKD and provide potential novel biomarkers for identifying individuals with early impaired kidney function at preclinical stages."

Alignment is a crucial step in data processing pipelines, whereby LC-MS features derived from common ions are assembled into a unified matrix amenable to further analysis. Variability in the analytical factors that influence liquid chromatography separations complicates data alignment. This is prominent when aligning data acquired in different laboratories, generated using non-identical instruments, or between batches from large-scale studies. Previously, we developed metabCombiner for aligning disparately acquired LC-MS metabolomics datasets. Here, we report significant upgrades to metabCombiner that enable the stepwise alignment of multiple untargeted LC-MS metabolomics datasets, facilitating inter-laboratory reproducibility studies. To accomplish this, a \"primary\" feature list is used as a template for matching compounds in \"target\" feature lists. We demonstrate this workflow by aligning four lipidomics datasets from core laboratories generated using each institution's in-house LC-MS instrumentation and methods.

CO2 levels have continued to rise at alarming rates leading to an increasingly uncertain climate. CO2 can be sequestered by engineered photosynthetic microorganisms and used for chemical production, representing a renewable production method for valuable chemical commodities such as biofuels, plastics, and food additives. The main challenges in using photosynthetic microorganisms for chemical production stem from the seemingly inherent limitations of carbon fixation and photosynthesis resulting in slower growth and lower average product titers compared to heterotrophic organisms.

This review will discuss the various efforts to overcome the intrinsic inefficiencies of carbon fixation and photosynthesis, including rewiring carbon fixation and photosynthesis, investigating alternative carbon fixation pathways, installing sugar catabolism to supplement carbon fixation, investigating newly discovered fast growing photosynthetic species, and using new synthetic biology tools such as CRISPR to radically alter metabolism."

We studied 11 Alaskan Husky dogs with AHE, but found no abnormalities in respiratory chain enzyme activities in muscle and liver, or mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear genes that cause LS in people. A genome wide association study was performed using eight of the affected dogs and 20 related but unaffected control AHs using the Illumina canine HD array. SLC19A3 was identified as a positional candidate gene. This gene controls the uptake of thiamine in the CNS via expression of the thiamine transporter protein THTR2. Dogs have two copies of this gene located within the candidate interval (SLC19A3.2 - 43.36-43.38 Mb and SLC19A3.1 - 43.411-43.419 Mb) on chromosome 25. Expression analysis in a normal dog revealed that one of the paralogs, SLC19A3.1, was expressed in the brain and spinal cord while the other was not. Subsequent exon sequencing of SLC19A3.1 revealed a 4bp insertion and SNP in the second exon that is predicted to result in a functional protein truncation of 279 amino acids (c.624 insTTGC, c.625 C>A). All dogs with AHE were homozygous for this mutation, 15/41 healthy AH control dogs were heterozygous carriers while 26/41 normal healthy AH dogs were wild type. Furthermore, this mutation was not detected in another 187 dogs of different breeds. These results suggest that this mutation in SLC19A3.1, encoding a thiamine transporter protein, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AHE."

        "abstract": "Postcontrast, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences are reported to be of variable value in veterinary and human neuroimaging. The source of hyperintensity in postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images is inconsistently reported and has implications for the significance of imaging findings. We hypothesized that the main source of increased signal intensity in postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images would be due to gadolinium leakage into adjacent fluid, and that the resulting gadolinium-induced T1 shortening causes reappearance of fluid hyperintensity, previously nulled on precontrast FLAIR images. A retrospective, descriptive study was carried out comparing T2 weighted, pre- and postcontrast T1 weighted and pre- and postcontrast weighted T2 FLAIR images in a variety of intracranial diseases in dogs and cats. A prospective, experimental, phantom, in vitro study was also done to compare the relative effects of gadolinium concentration on T2 weighted, T1 weighted, and FLAIR images. A majority of hyperintensities on postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images that were not present on precontrast FLAIR images were also present on precontrast T2 weighted images, and were consistent with normal or pathological fluid filled structures. Phantom imaging demonstrated increased sensitivity of FLAIR sequences to low concentrations of gadolinium compared to T1 weighted sequences. Apparent contrast enhancement on postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images often reflects leakage of gadolinium across normal or pathology specific barriers into fluid-filled structures, and hyperintensity may therefore represent normal fluid structures as well as pathological tissues. Findings indicated that postcontrast-T2 FLAIR images may provide insight into integrity of biological structures such as the ependymal and subarachnoid barriers that may be relevant to progression of disease."

        "abstract": "Abstract Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (> 200 repeats) in the 5' untranslated portion of the fragile mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), leading to deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA carrier protein that controls the translation of several other genes that regulate synaptic development and plasticity. Autism occurs in approximately 30% of FXS cases, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) occurs in an additional 30% of cases. Premutation repeat expansions (55 to 200 CGG repeats) may also give rise to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including both autism and PDD-NOS, through a different molecular mechanism that involves a direct toxic effect of the expanded CGG repeat FMR1 mRNA. RNA toxicity can also lead to aging effects including tremor, ataxia and cognitive decline, termed fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in premutation carriers in late life. In studies of mice bearing premutation expansions, there is evidence of early postnatal neuronal cell toxicity, presenting as reduced cell longevity, decreased dendritic arborization and altered synaptic morphology. There is also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in premutation carriers. Many of the problems with cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation neurons also parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in autism without fragile X mutations. Research regarding dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems in FXS, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)1/5 pathway and \u00ce\u00b3 aminobutyric acid (GABA)A pathways, have led to new targeted treatments for FXS. Preliminary evidence suggests that these new targeted treatments will also be beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism."

Its postsynaptic displacement is necessary for loss of AMPARs during homeostatic scaling down of synapses. Here, we demonstrate that upon Ca2+ influx, Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) binding to the N-terminus of PSD-95 mediates postsynaptic loss of PSD-95 and AMPARs during homeostatic scaling down. Our NMR structural analysis identified E17 within the PSD-95 N-terminus as important for binding to Ca2+/CaM by interacting with R126 on CaM. Mutating E17 to R prevented homeostatic scaling down in primary hippocampal neurons, which is rescued via charge inversion by ectopic expression of CaMR126E, as determined by analysis of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Accordingly, increased binding of Ca2+/CaM to PSD-95 induced by a chronic increase in Ca2+ influx is a critical molecular event in homeostatic downscaling of glutamatergic synaptic transmission."

        "abstract": "In eukaryotes, cellular respiration is driven by mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), an enzyme complex that requires copper cofactors for its catalytic activity. Insertion of copper into its catalytically active subunits, including COX2, is a complex process that requires metallochaperones and redox proteins including SCO1, SCO2, and COA6, a recently discovered protein whose molecular function is unknown. To uncover the molecular mechanism by which COA6 and SCO proteins mediate copper delivery to COX2, we have solved the solution structure of COA6, which reveals a coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain typical of redox-active proteins found in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. Accordingly, we demonstrate that COA6 can reduce the copper-coordinating disulfides of its client proteins, SCO1 and COX2, allowing for copper binding. Finally, our determination of the interaction surfaces and reduction potentials of COA6 and its client proteins provides a mechanism of how metallochaperone and disulfide reductase activities are coordinated to deliver copper to CcO."

        "abstract": "Retinal cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels (composed of three CNGA1 and one CNGB1 subunits) exhibit a Ca2+-induced reduction in channel open probability mediated by calmodulin (CaM). Defects in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of CNG channels may be linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and other inherited forms of blindness. Here, we report the NMR structure and binding analysis of CaM bound to two separate sites within CNGB1 (CaM1: residues 565-589 and CaM2: residues 1120-1147). Our binding studies reveal that CaM1 binds to the Ca2+-bound CaM N-lobe with at least fivefold higher affinity than it binds to the CaM C-lobe. By contrast, the CaM2 site binds to the Ca2+-bound CaM C-lobe with higher affinity than it binds to the N-lobe. CaM1 and CaM2 both exhibited very weak binding to Ca2+-free CaM. We present separate NMR structures of Ca2+-saturated CaM bound to CaM1 and CaM2 that define key intermolecular contacts: CaM1 residue F575 interacts with the CaM N-lobe while CaM2 residues L1129, L1132, and L1136 each make close contact with the CaM C-lobe. The CNGB1 mutation F575E abolishes CaM1 binding to the CaM N-lobe while L1132E and L1136E each abolish CaM2 binding to the CaM C-lobe. Thus, a single CaM can bind to both sites in CNGB1 in which the CaM N-lobe binds to CaM1 and the CaM C-lobe binds to CaM2. We propose a Ca2+-dependent conformational switch in the CNG channel caused by CaM binding, which may serve to attenuate cGMP binding to CNG channels at high cytosolic Ca2+ levels in dark-adapted photoreceptors."

Exon expression levels in blood before risperidone treatment were compared with pre-post risperidone change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) scores.

RNF40 is located at 16p11.2, a region implicated in autism and schizophrenia. Thus, these genes expressed before treatment were associated with subsequent clinical response.

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier is a central feature of HT pathogenesis, and leukocytes may contribute to this process. We sought to determine whether ischemic strokes that develop HT have differences in RNA expression in blood within 3 hours of stroke onset prior to treatment with thrombolytic therapy.MethodsStroke patient blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with thrombolysis, and leukocyte RNA was assessed by microarray analysis. Strokes that developed HT (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203011) were compared to strokes without HT (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203033) and controls (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203014).

RNA prediction of HT in stroke was evaluated using cross-validation, and in a second stroke cohort (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203052).ResultsIschemic strokes that developed HT had differential expression of 29 genes in circulating leukocytes prior to treatment with thrombolytic therapy. A panel of 6 genes could predict strokes that later developed HT with 80% sensitivity and 70.2% specificity. Key pathways involved in HT of human stroke are described, including amphiregulin, a growth factor that regulates matrix metalloproteinase-9; a shift in transforming growth factor-\u00ce\u00b2 signaling involving SMAD4, INPP5D, and IRAK3; and a disruption of coagulation factors V and VIII.InterpretationIdentified genes correspond to differences in inflammation and coagulation that may predispose to HT in ischemic stroke. Given the adverse impact of HT on stroke outcomes, further evaluation of the identified genes and pathways is warranted to determine their potential as therapeutic targets to reduce HT and as markers of HT risk."

        "title": "Targeting Neutrophils in Ischemic Stroke: Translational Insights from Experimental Studies",
        "abstract": "Neutrophils have key roles in ischemic brain injury, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. As such, neutrophils are of great interest as targets to treat and prevent ischemic stroke. After stroke, neutrophils respond rapidly promoting blood-brain barrier disruption, cerebral edema, and brain injury. A surge of neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species, proteases, and cytokines are released as neutrophils interact with cerebral endothelium. Neutrophils also are linked to the major processes that cause ischemic stroke, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. Thrombosis is promoted through interactions with platelets, clotting factors, and release of prothrombotic molecules. In atherosclerosis, neutrophils promote plaque formation and rupture by generating oxidized-low density lipoprotein, enhancing monocyte infiltration, and degrading the fibrous cap. In experimental studies targeting neutrophils can improve stroke. However, early human studies have been met with challenges, and suggest that selective targeting of neutrophils may be required. Several properties of neutrophil are beneficial and thus may important to preserve in patients with stroke including antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, and neuroprotective functions."

Our studies in rats have shown specific gene expression changes 24 \u00e2\u20ac\u2030hours after ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, status epilepticus, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, global ischemia, and following brief focal ischemia that simulated transient ischemic attacks in humans. Human studies show gene expression changes following ischemic stroke. These gene profiles predict a second cohort with >90% sensitivity and specificity. Gene profiles for ischemic stroke caused by large-vessel atherosclerosis and cardioembolism have been described that predict a second cohort with >85% sensitivity and specificity. Atherosclerotic genes were associated with clotting, platelets, and monocytes, and cardioembolic genes were associated with inflammation, infection, and neutrophils. These gene profiles predicted the cause of stroke in 58% of cryptogenic patients.

Young adult rats were subjected to a temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham operation. A polyethylene glycol-liposome-based transfection system was used to administer a miR-122 mimic after MCAO. Neurological deficits, brain infarction, brain vessel integrity, adhesion molecule expression and expression of miR-122 target and indirect-target genes were examined in blood at 24\u00e2\u20ac\u2030h after MCAO with or without miR-122 treatment. miR-122 decreased in blood after MCAO, whereas miR-122 mimic elevated miR-122 in blood 24\u00e2\u20ac\u2030h after MCAO. Intravenous but not intracerebroventricular injection of miR-122 mimic decreased neurological deficits and brain infarction, attenuated ICAM-1 expression, and maintained vessel integrity after MCAO. The miR-122 mimic also down-regulated direct target genes (e.g. Vcam1, Nos2, Pla2g2a) and indirect target genes (e.g. Alox5, Itga2b, Timp3, Il1b, Il2, Mmp8) in blood after MCAO which are predicted to affect cell adhesion, diapedesis, leukocyte extravasation, eicosanoid and atherosclerosis signaling. The data show that elevating miR-122 improves stroke outcomes and we postulate this occurs via downregulating miR-122 target genes in blood leukocytes."

Because ALA can be stored in adipose tissue, it is possible that some of its beneficial actions may be due to effects it has on the adipose tissue. We investigated the effects of dietary flaxseed both with and without an atherogenic cholesterol-enriched diet to determine the effects of dietary flaxseed on the expression of the adipose cytokines leptin and adiponectin. Rabbits were fed one of four diets: a regular (RG) diet, or a regular diet with added 0.5% cholesterol (CH), or 10% ground flaxseed (FX), or both (CF) for 8 weeks. Levels of leptin and adiponectin expression were assessed by RT-PCR in visceral adipose tissue. Consumption of flaxseed significantly increased plasma and adipose levels of ALA. Leptin protein and mRNA expression were lower in CH animals and were elevated in CF animals. Changes in leptin expression were strongly and positively correlated with adipose ALA levels and inversely correlated with levels of en face atherosclerosis. Adiponectin expression was not significantly affected by any of the dietary interventions. Our data demonstrate that the type of fat in the diet as well as its caloric content can specifically influence leptin expression. The findings support the hypothesis that the beneficial cardiovascular effects associated with flaxseed consumption may be related to a change in leptin expression."

Such low product yield can be attributed, in large part, to the incomplete utilization of the various carbohydrate sugars found in the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, we demonstrate that Lactobacillus brevis is able to simultaneously metabolize all fermentable carbohydrates in acid pre-processed rice straw hydrolysate, thereby allowing complete utilization of all released sugars. Inhibitors present in rice straw hydrolysate did not affect lactic acid production. Moreover, the activity of exogenously added cellulases was not reduced in the presence of growing cultures of L. brevis. These factors enabled the use of L. brevis in a process termed simultaneous saccharification and mixed sugar fermentation (SSMSF). In SSMSF with L. brevis, sugars present in rice straw hydrolysate were completely utilized while the cellulase maintained its maximum activity due to the lack of feedback inhibition from glucose and/or cellobiose. By comparison to a sequential hydrolysis and fermentation process, SSMSF reduced operation time and the amount of cellulase enzyme necessary to produce the same amount of lactic acid."

        "abstract": "Neurons expressing the calcium binding proteins (CaBPs) parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) have shown age-related density changes throughout the ascending auditory system of both rodents and macaque monkeys. In the cerebral cortex, neurons expressing these CaBPs express markers of \u00ce\u00b3-aminobutyric acidergic neurotransmission, such as GAD67, and have well-understood physiological response properties. Recent evidence suggests that, in the rodent auditory brainstem, CaBP-containing cells do not express GAD67. It is unknown whether PV- and CB-containing cells in subcortical auditory structures of macaques similarly do not express GAD67, and a better understanding of the neurotransmission of neurons expressing these proteins is necessary for understanding the age-related changes in their density throughout the macaque auditory system. This was investigated with immunofluorescent double-labeling techniques to coregister PV- and CB-expressing neurons with GAD67 in the superior olivary complex and the inferior colliculus of young and aged rhesus macaques. The proportions of GAD67-expressing PV- and CB-positive neurons were computed with unbiased sampling techniques. Our results indicate that between 42% and 62% of PV- and CB-positive neurons in the auditory brainstem and midbrain express GAD67, which is significantly less than in the cerebrum. In general, fewer PV(+) neurons and more CB(+) neurons expressed GAD67 as a function of age. These results demonstrate that the inhibitory molecular profile of PV- and CB-expressing neurons can change with age in subcortical auditory structures and that these neurons are distinct from the well-described inhibitory interneurons that express these proteins in the cerebral cortex."

ML neurons were less likely to phase lock, did not phase lock as strongly, and were more likely to respond in a nonsynchronized fashion than A1 cells, consistent with a temporal-to-rate transformation as information ascends the auditory hierarchy. ML neurons tended to have lower temporally (phase-locking) based best modulation frequencies than A1 neurons. Neurons that decreased their firing rate in response to AM noise relative to their firing rate in response to unmodulated noise became more common at the level of ML than they were in A1. In both A1 and ML, we found a prevalent class of neurons that usually have enhanced rate responses relative to responses to the unmodulated noise at lower modulation frequencies and suppressed rate responses relative to responses to the unmodulated noise at middle modulation frequencies.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY ML neurons synchronized less than A1 neurons, consistent with a hierarchical temporal-to-rate transformation. Both A1 and ML had a class of modulation transfer functions previously unreported in the cortex with a low-modulation-frequency (MF) peak, a middle-MF trough, and responses similar to unmodulated noise responses at high MFs. The results support a hierarchical shift toward a two-pool opponent code, where subtraction of neural activity between two populations of oppositely tuned neurons encodes AM."

        "abstract": "Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3) is a major methylarginine effector molecule that reads methyl-histone marks and facilitates gene transcription. However, the underlying mechanism by which TDRD3 functions as a transcriptional coactivator is unknown. We identified topoisomerase IIIB (TOP3B) as a component of the TDRD3 complex. TDRD3 serves as a molecular bridge between TOP3B and arginine-methylated histones. The TDRD3-TOP3B complex is recruited to the c-MYC gene promoter primarily by the H4R3me2a mark, and the complex promotes c-MYC gene expression. TOP3B relaxes negative supercoiled DNA and reduces transcription-generated R loops in vitro. TDRD3 knockdown in cells increases R loop formation at the c-MYC locus, and Tdrd3 null mice exhibit elevated R loop formation at this locus in B cells. Tdrd3 null mice show significantly increased c-Myc/Igh translocation, a process driven by R loop structures. By reducing negative supercoiling and resolving R loops, TOP3B promotes transcription, protects against DNA damage, and reduces the frequency of chromosomal translocations."

We also investigated the effect of depth-of-interaction (DOI) resolution on the spatial resolution. All the scanners are built upon 128 DOI encoding dual-ended readout detectors with lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) arrays arranged in 8 detector rings. The solid angle coverages of the four scanners are all \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc0.85 steradians. Each LYSO element has a cross-section of 0.44&nbsp;\u00c3\u2014&nbsp;0.44 mm2 and the pitch size of the LYSO arrays are all 0.5 mm. The four scanners can be divided into two groups: (1) H2RS110-C10 and H2RS110-C20 with 40&nbsp;\u00c3\u2014&nbsp;40 LYSO arrays, a ring diameter of 110 mm and axial length of 167 mm, and (2) H2RS160-C10 and H2RS160-C20 with 60&nbsp;\u00c3\u2014&nbsp;60 LYSO arrays, a diameter of 160 mm and axial length of 254 mm. C10 and C20 denote the crystal thickness of 10 and 20 mm, respectively. The simulation results show that all scanners have a spatial resolution better than 0.5 mm at the center of the field-of-view (FOV). The radial resolution strongly depends on the DOI resolution and radial offset, but not the axial resolution and tangential resolution. Comparing the C10 and C20 designs, the former provides better resolution, especially at positions away from the center of the FOV, whereas the latter has 2\u00c3\u2014 higher sensitivity (\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc10% versus \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc20%). This simulation study provides evidence that the 110 mm systems are a good choice for total-body mouse studies at a lower cost, whereas the 160 mm systems are suited for both total-body mouse and rat studies."

The role of innervation and neuromediators has been previously reviewed so here we focus on the role of the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) in wound healing, with the intent of targeting it in treatment of non-healing wounds. TRPV1 structure and function as well as the outcomes of TRPV1-targeted therapies utilized in several diseases and tissues are summarized. In skin, keratinocytes, sebocytes, nociceptors, and several immune cells express TRPV1, making it an attractive focus area for treating wounds. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors confound the function and targeting of TRPV1 and may lead to adverse or off-target effects. Therefore, a better understanding of what is known about the role of TRPV1 in skin and wound healing will inform future therapies to treat impaired and chronic wounds to improve healing."

        "abstract": "ObjectiveAlthough HAART effectively suppresses viral replication, it fails to eradicate latent viral reservoirs. The 'shock and kill' strategy involves the activation of HIV from latent reservoirs and targeting them for eradication. Our goal was to develop new approaches for activating HIV from latent reservoirs.DesignWe investigated capacity of Ingenol B (IngB), a newly modified derivative of Ingenol ester that was originally isolated from a Brazilian plant in Amazon, for its capacity and mechanisms of HIV reactivation.MethodsReactivation of HIV-1 by IngB was evaluated in J-Lat A1 cell culture model of HIV latency as well as in purified primary CD4 T cells from long-term HAART-treated virologically-suppressed HIV-infected individuals. The underlining molecular mechanisms of viral reactivation were investigated using flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation.ResultsIngB is highly effective in reactivating HIV in J-Lat A1 cells with relatively low cellular toxicity. It is also able to reactivate latent HIV in purified CD4 T cells from HAART-treated HIV-positive individuals ex vivo. Our data show that IngB may reactivate HIV expression by both activating protein kinase C (PKC)\u00ce\u00b4-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u00ce\u00baB) pathway and directly inducing NF-\u00ce\u00baB protein expression. Importantly, IngB has a synergistic effect with JQ1, a BET bromodomain inhibitor, in latent HIV reactivation.ConclusionsIngB is a new promising compound to activate latent HIV reservoirs. Our data suggest that formulating novel derivatives from Ingenol esters may be an innovative approach to develop new lead compounds to reactivate latent HIV."

In this study, we investigated the role of AVP in partner preference behavior in a monogamous primate, the coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus). Seven titi males each received three intranasal treatments: saline, low AVP (40 IU) and high AVP (80 IU) in random order, 1 week apart. They experienced a series of stimulus exposures to their female partner, a female stranger and an empty cage. Males were more likely to contact the stimulus and do so faster when either female stimulus was present. When pretreated with saline, males contacted the stranger more frequently than their partner; when pretreated with the high dosage of AVP, males contacted their partner more frequently than the stranger. We used microarray to measure peripheral changes in gene expression associated with intranasal AVP and found reduced expression of several genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines. The data presented here suggest that intranasally administered AVP has both central influences on social behavior and peripheral influences on inflammation in a nonhuman primate."

        "abstract": "Despite compelling evidence that oxytocin (OT) is effective in reducing body weight (BW) in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents, studies of the effects of OT in humans and rhesus monkeys have primarily focused on noningestive behaviors. The goal of this study was to translate findings in DIO rodents to a preclinical translational model of DIO. We tested the hypothesis that increased OT signaling would reduce BW in DIO rhesus monkeys by inhibiting food intake and increasing energy expenditure (EE). Male DIO rhesus monkeys from the California National Primate Research Center were adapted to a 12-h fast and maintained on chow and a daily 15% fructose-sweetened beverage. Monkeys received 2\u00c3\u2014 daily subcutaneous vehicle injections over 1 wk. We subsequently identified doses of OT (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) that reduced food intake and BW in the absence of nausea or diarrhea. Chronic administration of OT for 4 wk (0.2 mg/kg for 2 wk; 0.4 mg/kg for 2 wk) reduced BW relative to vehicle by 3.3 \u00c2\u00b1 0.4% (\u00e2\u2030\u02c60.6 kg; P < 0.05). Moreover, the low dose of OT suppressed 12-h chow intake by 26 \u00c2\u00b1 7% (P < 0.05). The higher dose of OT reduced 12-h chow intake by 27 \u00c2\u00b1 5% (P < 0.05) and 8-h fructose-sweetened beverage intake by 18 \u00c2\u00b1 8% (P < 0.05). OT increased EE during the dark cycle by 14 \u00c2\u00b1 3% (P < 0.05) and was associated with elevations of free fatty acids and glycerol and reductions in triglycerides suggesting increased lipolysis. Together, these data suggest that OT reduces BW in DIO rhesus monkeys through decreased food intake as well as increased EE and lipolysis."

        "abstract": "Monogamy is a relatively rare social system in mammals, occurring only in about 3% of mammalian species. Monogamous species are characterized by the formation of pair-bonds, biparental care, and a very low level of sexual dimorphism. Whereas in most polygynous species males engage in more rough-and-tumble play than females, we predicted that males and females of monogamous species would have similar, or monomorphic, play behavior. In this study, we focused on two monogamous species: coppery titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). We documented the development of play behavior in both species, and quantified different types of play behavior. We did not find any sex differences in either species in the frequencies and types of play. However, we did find sex differences in the choice of play partner in titi monkeys: female offspring spent a higher proportion of time playing with their father, while male offspring played equally with their mother and father. It is possible that rough-and-tumble play behavior is monomorphic in many monogamous mammals, perhaps reflecting differences from polygynous species in the effects of exposure to early androgens or in the estrogen receptor distribution. However, more subtle differences in monomorphic play behavior, such as choice of partner, may still exist. \u00c2\u00a9 2008 The Authors."

Here we used the socially monogamous prairie vole as a translational model of developmental SSRI exposure. Paired female prairie voles (n = 20) were treated with 5 mg/kg subcutaneous fluoxetine (FLX) or saline (SAL) daily from birth of the second litter until the day of birth of the 4th litter. This design created three cohorts of FLX exposure: postnatal exposure in litter 2, both prenatal and postnatal exposure in litter 3, and prenatal exposure in litter 4. Post-weaning, subjects underwent behavioral testing to detect changes in sociality, repetitive behavior, pair-bond formation, and anxiety-like behavior. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was performed for oxytocin, vasopressin 1a, and serotonin 1a receptor density in a subset of brains. We observed increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced sociality in developmentally FLX exposed adults. FLX exposure decreased oxytocin receptor binding in the nucleus accumbens core and central amygdala, and vasopressin 1a receptor binding in the medial amygdala. FLX exposure did not affect serotonin 1A receptor binding in any areas examined. Changes to oxytocin and vasopressin receptors may underlie the behavioral changes observed and have translational implications for the mechanism of the increased risk of ASD subsequent to prenatal SSRI exposure."

Since PEDOT:PSS is only usable as a blend it is not possible to study PEDOT:PSS without this interfacial layer. Through the use of the self-doped polymer sulfonated poly(thiophene-3-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy]-2,5-diyl) (S-P3MEET) and a polyfluorinated ionomer (PFI) it is possible to compare transparent conducting organic films with and without interfacial layers and to understand their function. Using neutron reflectometry, we show that PFI preferentially segregates at the top surface of the film during coating and forms a thermally-stable surface layer. Because of this distribution we find that even small amounts of PFI increase the electron work function of the hole transport layer. We also find that annealing at 150\u00c2\u00b0C and above reduces the work function compared to samples heated at lower temperatures. Using near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and gas chromatography we show that this reduction in work function is due to S-P3MEET being doped by PFI. Organic photovoltaic devices with S-P3MEET/PFI hole transport layers yield higher power conversion efficiency than devices with pure S-P3MEET or PEDOT:PSS hole transport layers. Additionally, devices with a doped interface layer of S-P3MEET/PFI show superior performance to those with un-doped S-P3MEET. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry. 2014."

Using a case-control design, we compared 33 post-menopausal caregivers (the chronic stress group) to 28 age-matched low-stress control women on reported HPF consumption (modified Block Food Frequency Questionnaire), waistline circumference, truncal fat ultrasound, and insulin sensitivity using a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. A fasting blood draw was assayed for plasma NPY and oxidative stress markers (8-hydroxyguanosine and F2-Isoprostanes).ResultsAmong chronically stressed women only, greater HPF consumption was associated with greater abdominal adiposity, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance at baseline (all p's\u00e2\u2030\u00a4.01). Furthermore, plasma NPY was significantly elevated in chronically stressed women (p<.01), and the association of HPF with abdominal adiposity was stronger among women with high versus low NPY. There were no significant predictions of change over 1-year, likely due to high stability (little change) in the primary outcomes over this period.DiscussionChronic stress is associated with enhanced vulnerability to diet-related metabolic risk (abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress). Stress-induced peripheral NPY may play a mechanistic role."

        "abstract": "The initial cause of post-neutering weight gain in male cats is not entirely known. There is evidence that energy intake (EI) increases rapidly post-neutering, but it is not clear if neutering also decreases energy expenditure (EE) prior to weight gain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if a decrease in EE contributes to the initial shift toward positive energy balance in neutered male cats. To determine the influence of neutering on EE independent of changes in EI and body weight (BW), male cats were fed at their pre-neutering maintenance EI and EE was measured at 4 days pre-neutering, 3-4 days post-neutering, and 9 days post- neutering. Ad libitum food access was then provided for 6 months. Body composition was measured and blood samples collected for serum chemistry at pre-neutering and 7 days, 13 days and 6 months post-neutering. Total energy expenditure (TEE) adjusted for lean body mass (LBM) did not change in cats from pre-neutering to 9 days post-neutering. However, TEE adjusted for BW and resting energy expenditure adjusted for either LBM or BW showed a small, but significant (P<0.05) increase from pre-neutering to 9 days post-neutering. When allowed free choice food access, cats showed significant increases of food intake (FI) and BW. Circulating concentrations of ghrelin increased, while adiponectin levels decreased following neutering. The results of this study indicate that initial post-neutering weight gain in male cats results from increased FI and not decreased EE. Long-term control of FI should be initiated after neutering to prevent hyperphagia and weight gain in male cats."

        "abstract": "ObjectiveOur objective was to determine the effects of prolonged exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on leptin secretion from and leptin (OB) gene expression in isolated adipocytes. Because glucose uptake and the metabolism of glucose beyond lactate are important determinants of leptin production in adipocytes, we examined the effects of TNF-alpha on glucose uptake and lactate production and their relationship to leptin secretion.Design and methodsIsolated rat adipocytes were anchored in a defined matrix of basement membrane components and cultured with media containing 5 mM glucose, 0.16 nM insulin and several concentrations of TNF-alpha. Leptin secretion, steady-state levels of leptin mRNA levels, glucose uptake, and lactate production were assessed over 96 h.ResultsTNF-alpha at concentrations of 0.024, 0.24, 2.4 and 24 ng/ml did not affect leptin secretion over 24 h. TNF-alpha at concentrations of 0.24 to 24 ng/ml significantly inhibited leptin secretion over 96 h by 19-60%. TNF-alpha at concentrations of 0.024 to 24 ng/ml significantly decreased steady-state levels of leptin mRNA after 96 h by 32-95%. In addition, TNF-alpha at concentrations of 2.4 and 24 ng/ml significantly increased glucose uptake and lactate production over 96 h by 30-57%. TNF-alpha at a concentration of 0.024 ng/ml did not affect leptin secretion, glucose uptake or lactate production. Overall, for the TNF-alpha concentrations tested, leptin secretion was inversely related to the percent of glucose carbon released as lactate; however, TNF-alpha did not induce a proportional increase of lactate production from glucose.ConclusionShort-term (24 h) exposure of isolated adipocytes to TNF-alpha does not affect leptin secretion. Prolonged exposure to TNF-alpha produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of leptin secretion and gene expression. This suggests that the acute effect of TNF-alpha to increase circulating leptin levels in vivo may be indirect. TNF-alpha at higher concentrations increases glucose uptake, but does not increase the conversion of glucose to lactate. Therefore, TNF-alpha appears to induce a dissociation between adipocyte glucose metabolism and leptin production."

        "abstract": "The adipocyte hormone, leptin, is secreted in proportion to adipose mass and is implicated in the regulation of energy balance via its central actions on food intake and sympathetic nervous system activity. The placenta was also shown recently to be a possible source of leptin in pregnant women, raising the possibility that the normal relationship between leptin and adiposity may be altered in pre-eclampsia. We therefore sought to assess the extent to which maternal second trimester serum leptin concentrations differed for women who would subsequently develop pre-eclampsia and those who would remain normotensive. This nested case-control study population comprised 38 women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria (pre-eclampsia) and 192 normotensive women. Multiple least-squares regression procedures were used to assess the independent relationship between leptin concentrations and risk of pre-eclampsia. Serum leptin concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay, were highly correlated with maternal pre-pregnancy and second trimester body mass index (r = 0.71 and r = 0.74 respectively; P < 0.001 for both) among normotensive women, and to a lesser extent among women who developed pre-eclampsia (r = 0.29 and r = 0.42; P = 0.09 and 0.02 respectively). Among women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of < or = 25 kg/m2, pre-eclampsia cases compared with controls had higher mean second trimester leptin concentrations after adjustment for confounding factors. In contrast, pre-eclampsia cases had lower mean leptin concentrations than controls for those women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index above 25 kg/m2. Other factors in addition to the level of adiposity may therefore influence serum leptin concentrations in pre-eclamptic pregnant women. Our results suggest the possibility that leptin, like several other placentally derived substances (e.g. steroid hormones, eicosanoids and cytokines), may be involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Further work is needed to confirm our findings and to assess the metabolic importance and determinants of leptin concentrations in uncomplicated and pre-eclamptic pregnancies."

The effects of fructose, compared with glucose, ingestion on metabolic profiles in obese subjects has not been studied.ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to compare the effects of fructose- and glucose-sweetened beverages consumed with meals on hormones and metabolic substrates in obese subjects.Design and settingThe study had a within-subject design conducted in the clinical and translational research center.ParticipantsParticipants included 17 obese men (n = 9) and women (n = 8), with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2).InterventionsSubjects were studied under two conditions involving ingestion of mixed nutrient meals with either glucose-sweetened beverages or fructose-sweetened beverages. The beverages provided 30% of total kilocalories. Blood samples were collected over 24 h.Main outcome measuresArea under the curve (24 h AUC) for glucose, lactate, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, uric acid, triglycerides (TGs), and free fatty acids was measured.ResultsCompared with glucose-sweetened beverages, fructose consumption was associated with lower AUCs for insulin (1052.6 +/- 135.1 vs. 549.2 +/- 79.7 muU/ml per 23 h, P < 0.001) and leptin (151.9 +/- 22.7 vs. 107.0 +/- 15.0 ng/ml per 24 h, P < 0.03) and increased AUC for TG (242.3 +/- 96.8 vs. 704.3 +/- 124.4 mg/dl per 24 h, P < 0.0001). Insulin-resistant subjects exhibited larger 24-h TG profiles (P < 0.03).ConclusionsIn obese subjects, consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages with meals was associated with less insulin secretion, blunted diurnal leptin profiles, and increased postprandial TG concentrations compared with glucose consumption. Increases of TGs were augmented in obese subjects with insulin resistance, suggesting that fructose consumption may exacerbate an already adverse metabolic profile present in many obese subjects."

        "abstract": "Podocytes play an important role in maintaining glomerular function, and podocyte injury is a significant component in the pathogenesis of proteinuria. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a cytosolic enzyme whose genetic deficiency and pharmacological inhibition have beneficial effects on renal function, but its role in podocytes remains unexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of sEH in podocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced kidney injury. We report increased sEH transcript and protein expression in murine podocytes upon LPS challenge. To determine the function of sEH in podocytes in&nbsp;vivo we generated podocyte-specific sEH-deficient (pod-sEHKO) mice. Following LPS challenge, podocyte sEH-deficient mice exhibited lower kidney injury, proteinuria, and blood urea nitrogen concentrations than controls suggestive of preserved renal function. Also, renal mRNA and serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, and TNF\u00ce\u00b1 were significantly lower in LPS-treated pod-sEHKO than control mice. Moreover, podocyte sEH deficiency was associated with decreased LPS-induced NF-\u00ce\u00baB and MAPK activation and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, the protective effects of podocyte sEH deficiency in&nbsp;vivo were recapitulated in E11 murine podocytes treated with a selective sEH pharmacological inhibitor. Altogether, these findings identify sEH in podocytes as a contributor to signaling events in acute renal injury and suggest that sEH inhibition may be of therapeutic value in proteinuria.EnzymesSoluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10."

        "abstract": "Galectin-12, a member of the galectin family of animal lectins, is preferentially expressed in adipocytes. We recently reported that this galectin is localized on lipid droplets, specialized organelles for fat storage. Galectin-12 regulates lipid degradation (lipolysis) by modulating lipolytic protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Mice deficient in galectin-12 exhibit enhanced adipocyte lipolysis, increased mitochondria respiration, reduced adiposity and ameliorated insulin resistance associated with weight gain. The results suggest that galectin-12 may be a useful target for treatment of obesity-related metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Most previously described galectins largely reside in the cytosol, although they can also be induced to become associated with membrane-containing structures. Along with an in-depth characterization of galectin-12, this mini-review comments on this first report of a galectin normally localized specifically in an organelle that performs an important intracellular function. Further studies will help shed light on how this protein regulates cellular homeostasis, especially energy homeostasis, and provide additional insight into the intracellular functions of galectins."

Timothy syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(v)1.2 that is associated with developmental delay and autism. We generated cortical neuronal precursor cells and neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from individuals with Timothy syndrome. Cells from these individuals have defects in calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling and activity-dependent gene expression. They also show abnormalities in differentiation, including decreased expression of genes that are expressed in lower cortical layers and in callosal projection neurons. In addition, neurons derived from individuals with Timothy syndrome show abnormal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased production of norepinephrine and dopamine. This phenotype can be reversed by treatment with roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and atypical L-type-channel blocker. These findings provide strong evidence that Ca(v)1.2 regulates the differentiation of cortical neurons in humans and offer new insights into the causes of autism in individuals with Timothy syndrome."

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose- Optimal blood pressure (BP) management during the early stages of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remains uncertain. Observational studies have found worse outcomes in patients with increased hemodynamic variability, suggesting BP optimization as a potential neuroprotective strategy. In this study, we calculated personalized BP targets at which cerebral autoregulation was best preserved. We analyzed how deviation from these limits correlates with functional outcome. Methods- We prospectively enrolled 31 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autoregulatory function was continuously measured by interrogating changes in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived tissue oxygenation-a surrogate for cerebral blood flow-as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) in response to changes in mean arterial pressure using time-correlation analysis. The resulting autoregulatory indices were used to identify the upper and lower limit of autoregulation. Percent time that mean arterial pressure exceeded limits of autoregulation was calculated for each patient. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at discharge and 90 days. Associations with outcome were analyzed using ordinal multivariate logistic regression. Results- Personalized limits of autoregulation were computed in all patients (age 57.5\u00c2\u00b113.4, 23F, mean World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 2\u00c2\u00b11, monitoring time 67.8\u00c2\u00b150.8 hours). Optimal BP and limits of autoregulation were calculated on average for 89.5\u00c2\u00b16.7% of the total monitoring period. ICP- and NIRS-derived optimal pressures strongly correlated with one another (P<0.0001). Percent time that mean arterial pressure deviated from limits of autoregulation significantly associated with worse functional outcome at discharge (NIRS, P=0.001; ICP, P=0.004) and 90 days (NIRS, P=0.002; ICP, P=0.003), adjusting separately for age, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons, vasospasm, and delayed cerebral ischemia. Conclusions- Both invasive (ICP) and noninvasive (NIRS) determination of personalized BP targets after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is feasible, and these 2 approaches revealed significant collinearity. Furthermore, exceeding individualized limits of autoregulation was associated with poor functional outcomes."

        "abstract": "The entrapment of nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) and liposomes in transparent, nanoporous silica gel derived from the precursor tetramethylorthosilicate was investigated. NLPs are discoidal patches of lipid bilayer that are belted by amphiphilic scaffold proteins and have an average thickness of 5 nm. The NLPs in this work had a diameter of roughly 15 nm and utilized membrane scaffold protein (MSP), a genetically altered variant of apolipoprotein A-I. Liposomes have previously been examined inside of silica sol-gels and have been shown to exhibit instability. This is attributed to their size (\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc150 nm) and altered structure and constrained lipid dynamics upon entrapment within the nanometer-scale pores (5-50 nm) of the silica gel. By contrast, the dimensional match of NLPs with the intrinsic pore sizes of silica gel opens the possibility for their entrapment without disruption. Here we demonstrate that NLPs are more compatible with the nanometer-scale size of the porous environment by analysis of lipid phase behavior via fluorescence anisotropy and analysis of scaffold protein secondary structure via circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our results showed that the lipid phase behavior of NLPs entrapped inside of silica gel display closer resemblance to its solution behavior, more so than liposomes, and that the MSP in the NLPs maintain the high degree of \u00ce\u00b1-helix secondary structure associated with functional protein-lipid interactions after entrapment. We also examined the effects of residual methanol on lipid phase behavior and the size of NLPs and found that it exerts different influences in solution and in silica gel; unlike in free solution, silica entrapment may be inhibiting NLP size increase and/or aggregation. These findings set precedence for a bioinorganic hybrid nanomaterial that could incorporate functional integral membrane proteins."

        "abstract": "Single giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) rupture spontaneously from their salt-laden suspension onto solid surfaces. At hydrophobic surfaces, the GUVs rupture via a recurrent, bouncing ball rhythm. During each contact, the GUVs, rendered tense by the substrate interactions, porate, and spread a molecularly transformed motif of a monomolecular layer on the hydrophobic surface from the point of contact in a symmetric manner. The competition from pore closure, however, limits the spreading and produces a daughter vesicle, which re-engages with the substrate. At solid hydrophilic surfaces, by contrast, GUVs rupture via a distinctly different recurrent burst-heal dynamics; during burst, single pores nucleate at the contact boundary of the adhering vesicles, facilitating asymmetric spreading and producing a \"heart\"-shaped membrane patch. During the healing phase, the competing pore closure produces a daughter vesicle. In both cases, the pattern of burst-reseal events repeats multiple times, splashing and spreading the vesicular fragments as bilayer patches at the solid surface in a pulsatory manner. These remarkable recurrent dynamics arise, not because of the elastic properties of the solid surface, but because the competition between membrane spreading and pore healing, prompted by the surface-energy-dependent adhesion, determine the course of the topological transition."

        "abstract": "Lamellar mesophases of insoluble lipids are readily solubilized by the micellar mesophases of soluble surfactants. This simple process underscores a broad array of biochemical methodologies, including purification, reconstitution, and crystallization of membrane proteins, as well as the isolation of detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Although much is now known about the thermodynamic driving forces of membrane solubilization, the kinetic pathways by which the surfactant alters vesicular mesophases are only beginning to be appreciated. Little is known about how these interactions affect the solubilization of more complex, multilamellar mesophases. Here, we investigate how a common zwitterionic detergent affects the solubilization of a smectic, multilamellar, cylindrical mesophase of lipids, called the myelin figure. Our results reveal that myelin solubilization occurs in a multistep manner, producing a well-defined sequence of morphologically distinct intermediates en route to complete solubilization. The kinetic processes producing these intermediates include (1) coiling, which encompasses the formation, propagation, and tightening of extended helices; (2) thinning, which reflects the unbinding of lamellae in the smectic stacks; and (3) detachment or retraction, which either dissociates the myelinic protrusion from the source lipid mass or returns the myelinic protrusion to the source lipid mass\u00e2\u201d\u20acall in transit toward complete solubilization. These occasionally overlapping steps are most pronounced in single-lipid component myelins, while compositionally graded multicomponent myelins inhibit the coiling step and detach more frequently. Taken together, the appearance of these intermediates during the solubilization of myelins suggests a complex free-energy landscape characterizing myelin solubilization populated by metastable, morphological intermediates correlated with locally minimized changes in energy dependent upon the mesophase's composition. This then predicts the accessibility of structurally distinct, kinetic intermediates\u00e2\u201d\u20acsuch as loose and tight coiled helices, peeled myelins, retracted tubes, and detached protrusions\u00e2\u201d\u20acbefore reaching the stable ground state corresponding to a dissolved suspension of mixed surfactant-lipid micelles."

The large research community and economic importance of loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L., made it an early candidate for reference sequence determination.ResultsWe develop a novel strategy to sequence the genome of loblolly pine that combines unique aspects of pine reproductive biology and genome assembly methodology. We use a whole genome shotgun approach relying primarily on next generation sequence generated from a single haploid seed megagametophyte from a loblolly pine tree, 20-1010, that has been used in industrial forest tree breeding. The resulting sequence and assembly was used to generate a draft genome spanning 23.2 Gbp and containing 20.1 Gbp with an N50 scaffold size of 66.9 kbp, making it a significant improvement over available conifer genomes. The long scaffold lengths allow the annotation of 50,172 gene models with intron lengths averaging over 2.7 kbp and sometimes exceeding 100 kbp in length. Analysis of orthologous gene sets identifies gene families that may be unique to conifers. We further characterize and expand the existing repeat library based on the de novo analysis of the repetitive content, estimated to encompass 82% of the genome.ConclusionsIn addition to its value as a resource for researchers and breeders, the loblolly pine genome sequence and assembly reported here demonstrates a novel approach to sequencing the large and complex genomes of this important group of plants that can now be widely applied."

        "abstract": "Humans have circulating antibodies against diverse glycans containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) due to function-loss mutation of the CMAH gene. This xenogenic non-human carbohydrate is abundant in red meat, xenografts and biotherapeutics. Low levels of diet-derived Neu5Gc is also present on normal human endothelial cells, and together with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could potentially mediate \"xenosialitis\" chronic-inflammation. Rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin (ATG) is a drug containing polyclonal IgG glycoproteins commonly used as an immunosuppressant in human transplantation and autoimmune diseases. In type-1 diabetes patients, infusion of Neu5Gc-glycosylated ATG caused increased global anti-Neu5Gc response. Here, for the first time we explore changes in anti-Neu5Gc IgG repertoire following the immunization elicited by ATG, compared with the basal antibodies repertoire that reflect exposure to dietary-Neu5Gc. We used glycan microarrays with multiple Neu5Gc-glycans and controls to elucidate eventual differences in ATG-elicited repertoire, before/after ATG administration and track their kinetics (0, 1, 18 and 24 months). Response of all basal-pre-existing Neu5Gc-specific antibodies rapidly increased. This response peaked at one month post-ATG, with enhanced affinity, then resolved at 18-24 months. Induced-antibodies showed expanded diversity and de-novo recognition of different Neu5Gc-glycans, including endogenous glycolipids, that was further validated by affinity-purified anti-Neu5Gc antibodies from patients' sera. These findings strongly suggest that ATG-induced anti-Neu5Gc IgGs represent a secondary exposure to this dietary carbohydrate-antigen in humans, with immune memory. Given their modified recognition patterns, ATG-evoked anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could potentially mediate biological effects different from pre-existing antibodies."

N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its hydroxylated form N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are common Sia in mammals. Humans cannot synthesize Neu5Gc but accumulate it on cells through red-meat rich diets, generating numerous immunogenic Neu5Gc-neoantigens. Consequently, humans have diverse anti-Neu5Gc antibodies affecting xenotransplantation, cancer, atherosclerosis, and infertility. Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies circulate as IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes; however, repertoires of the different isotypes in a large population have not been studied yet. Here, we used glycan microarrays to investigate anti-Neu5Gc IgGs and IgAs in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or pooled human IgA, respectively. Binding patterns on microarrays fabricated with Neu5Gc- and Neu5Ac-glycans, together with inhibition assays, revealed that different IVIG preparations have highly specific anti-Neu5Gc IgG reactivity with closely related repertoires, while IgAs show cross-reactivity against several Neu5Ac-glycans. Such different anti-Neu5Gc IgG/IgA repertoires in individuals could possibly mediate distinctive effects on human diseases."

Baseline morphologic cartilage 3T MRI readings (WORMS scoring) and T2 measurements (resolution = 0.313 mm \u00c3\u2014 0.446 mm) were performed in the medial and lateral femurs, medial and lateral tibias, and patella compartments. To create a reference database, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the data to obtain the 5th-95th percentile values for T2.ResultsSignificant differences in mean cartilage T2 values were observed between joint compartments. Although females had slightly higher T2 values than males in a majority of compartments, the differences were only significant in the medial femur (P < 0.0001). A weak positive association was seen between age and T2 in all compartments, most pronounced in the patella (3.27% increase in median T2/10 years, P = 0.009). Significant associations between BMI and T2 were observed, most pronounced in the lateral tibia (5.33% increase in median T2/5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, P < 0.0001), and medial tibia (4.81% increase in median T2 /5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, P < 0.0001).ConclusionsThis study established the first reference database of T2 values in a large sample of morphologically normal cartilage plates in knees without radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA).

At baseline, 15/54 subjects had prevalent ACL ruptures and 15/54 subjects had prevalent ACL reconstruction (24/54 normal ACL). Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, Physical Activity Scores of the Elderly (PASE) and thigh muscle characteristics including strength, fat infiltration (Goutallier score) and thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) MR measurements were obtained at baseline. Whole-organ MR-imaging Scores (WORMS) were obtained at baseline and at a 4-year follow-up time-point. Multivariate regression models, adjusting for covariates (age, gender, body mass index), were used for statistical analysis.ResultsAt baseline, subjects with prevalent ACL ruptures had worse WORMS total scores (mean\u00c2\u00b1SEM, 44.1\u00c2\u00b13.5) than subjects with ACL reconstruction (30.8\u00c2\u00b14.0; P = 0.015) and worse than subjects with normal ACL (21.3\u00c2\u00b13.0; P<0.001). Cartilage scores were worse in both femorotibial compartments in ACL injured knees than in knees with normal ACL (P<0.05). Knees with ACL reconstruction showed an increased degeneration of the medial meniscus (P = 0.036), cartilage degeneration at the medial femoral condyle (P = 0.011). In a multivariate regression model, including both ACL groups and total muscle characteristics as influence parameters, high thigh muscle CSA, high muscle/ fat ratio and low Goutallier scores were associated with less degenerative changes at the knee, independent of ACL status. Knees with ACL reconstruction showed an increased progression of cartilage degeneration at the medial tibia compared to the normal ACL group (P = 0.027).ConclusionsHigh thigh muscle CSA is associated with less degenerative changes at the knee, independent of the ACL status and may potentially be advantageous in the prevention of early OA."

Other than case reports or series, there has been no systemic study evaluating pericardial imaging findings in patients with coccidioidomycosis to the best of our knowledge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate intrathoracic computed tomographic (CT) imaging abnormalities in patients with coccidioidal infection with specific emphasis on the pericardium.MethodsRetrospective review of radiology reports and clinical chart review was performed to identify patients with coccidioidomycosis between January 2000 and September 2021 at our medical center. Diagnosis of infection was confirmed predominately with serology. Patients were excluded if a CT was not performed within 3&nbsp;months of confirmed diagnosis date and if there was concomitant additional granulomatous or fungal infection. Chest CT was reviewed for pericardial and additional intrathoracic findings.ResultsThe final retrospective cohort consisted of 37 patients. Imaging findings included lung nodules (N\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203033/37), consolidation (N\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203025/37), mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (N\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203020/37) and pleural effusions (N\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203013/37). Eleven of 37 patients (30%) had either trace pericardial fluid (N\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20303/37) or small pericardial effusions (N\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20308/37). One patient had pericardial enhancement/thickening and history of pericardial tamponade. No other patient had clinical pericarditis or pericardial tamponade. Pericardial calcifications were not seen in any patient. Pericardial effusion was statistically associated with presence of pleural effusion as 9/13 patients with pleural effusion had pericardial effusion versus 2/26 patients without pleural effusion had pericardial effusion (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001). Otherwise patients with and without pericardial imaging findings were similar in terms of demographics, comorbidities and other imaging findings.ConclusionPulmonary parenchymal pathology is a common manifestation of coccidioidal infection. Most patients with coccidioidomycosis do not have pericardial imaging abnormalities on CT."

However, the therapeutic potential of vaccine immunotherapy for malignant glioma should not be underestimated. In contrast to many of the available treatments, vaccine immunotherapy is unique because it offers the means of delivering treatment that is highly specific to both the patient and the tumor. Peptide, heat-shock proteins, and dendritic cell vaccines collectively encapsulate the majority of research efforts involving vaccine-based treatment modalities.

We first formulate the vehicular traffic signal control problem as a job scheduling problem on processors, with jobs corresponding to platoons of vehicles. Under the assumption that all jobs are of equal size, we give an online algorithm, referred to as the oldest job first (OJF) algorithm, to minimize the delay across the intersection. We prove that the OJF algorithm is 2-competitive, implying that the delay is less than or equal to twice the delay of an optimal offline schedule with perfect knowledge of the arrivals. We then show how a VANET can be used to group vehicles into approximately equal-sized platoons, which can then be scheduled using OJF. We call this the two-phase approach, where we first group the vehicular traffic into platoons and then apply the OJF algorithm, i.e., the oldest arrival first (OAF) algorithm. Our simulation results show that, under light and medium traffic loads, the OAF algorithm reduces the delays experienced by vehicles as they pass through the intersection, as compared with vehicle-actuated methods, Webster's method, and pretimed signal control methods. Under heavy vehicular traffic load, the OAF algorithm performs the same as the vehicle-actuated traffic method but still produces lower delays, as when compared with Webster's method and the pretimed signal control method. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 IEEE."

Although RNA extracted from human milk has been used to assay the mammary transcriptome non-invasively, this assay has not been adequately validated in primates. Thus, the objectives of the current study were to assess the suitability of lactating rhesus macaques as a model for lactating humans and to determine whether RNA extracted from milk fractions is representative of RNA extracted from mammary tissue for the purpose of studying the transcriptome of milk-producing cells. Results We confirmed that macaque milk contains cytoplasmic crescents and that ample high-quality RNA can be obtained for sequencing. Using RNA sequencing, RNA extracted from macaque milk fat and milk cell fractions more accurately represented RNA from mammary epithelial cells (cells that produce milk) than did RNA from whole mammary tissue. Mammary epithelium-specific transcripts were more abundant in macaque milk fat, whereas adipose or stroma-specific transcripts were more abundant in mammary tissue. Functional analyses confirmed the validity of milk as a source of RNA from milk-producing mammary epithelial cells. Conclusions RNA extracted from the milk fat during lactation accurately portrayed the RNA profile of milk-producing mammary epithelial cells in a non-human primate. However, this sample type clearly requires protocols that minimize RNA degradation. Overall, we validated the use of RNA extracted from human and macaque milk and provided evidence to support the use of lactating macaques as a model for human lactation."

Moreover, there are presently no methods to track the flow of mobile DNA elements such as plasmids through communities or to determine which of these are co-localized within the same cell. We address these limitations by applying Hi-C, a technology originally designed for the study of three-dimensional genome structure in eukaryotes, to measure the cellular co-localization of DNA sequences. We leveraged Hi-C data generated from a simple synthetic metagenome sample to accurately cluster metagenome assembly contigs into groups that contain nearly complete genomes of each species. The Hi-C data also reliably associated plasmids with the chromosomes of their host and with each other. We further demonstrated that Hi-C data provides a long-range signal of strain-specific genotypes, indicating such data may be useful for high-resolution genotyping of microbial populations. Our work demonstrates that Hi-C sequencing data provide valuable information for metagenome analyses that are not currently obtainable by other methods. This metagenomic Hi-C method could facilitate future studies of the fine-scale population structure of microbes, as well as studies of how antibiotic resistance plasmids (or other genetic elements) mobilize in microbial communities. The method is not limited to microbiology; the genetic architecture of other heterogeneous populations of cells could also be studied with this technique."

This process of intron-mediated enhancement (IME) is most thoroughly studied in Arabidopsis thaliana, where it has been shown that enhancing introns are typically located near the promoter and are compositionally distinct from downstream introns. In this study, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of several sequenced plant genomes. We find that enhancing sequences are conserved in the multi-cellular plants but are either absent or unrecognizable in algae. IME signals are preferentially located towards the 5'-end of first introns but also appear to be enriched in 5'-UTRs and coding regions near the transcription start site. Enhancing introns are found most prominently in genes that are highly expressed in a wide range of tissues. Through site-directed mutagenesis in A. thaliana, we show that IME signals can be inserted or removed from introns to increase or decrease gene expression. Although we do not yet know the specific mechanism of IME, the predicted signals appear to be both functional and highly conserved."

Indeed, while exerting positive tropic effects in response to physiologic and pathologic stressors, \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic stimulation influences cardiac electrophysiology and can lead to disturbances of the heart rhythm and potentially lethal arrhythmias, particularly in pathological settings. For this reason, \u00ce\u00b2-blockers are widely utilized clinically as antiarrhythmics. In this review, the molecular mechanisms of \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic action in the heart, the cellular and tissue level cardiac responses to \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic stimulation, and the clinical use of \u00ce\u00b2-blockers as antiarrhythmic agents are reviewed. We emphasize the complex interaction between cardiomyocyte signaling, contraction, and electrophysiology occurring over multiple time- and spatial-scales during pathophysiological responses to \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic stimulation. An integrated understanding of this complex system is essential for optimizing therapies aimed at preventing arrhythmias."

        "abstract": "Torsade de Pointes (TdP), a rare but lethal ventricular arrhythmia, is a toxic side effect of many drugs. To assess TdP risk, safety regulatory guidelines require quantification of hERG channel block in vitro and QT interval prolongation in vivo for all new therapeutic compounds. Unfortunately, these have proven to be poor predictors of torsadogenic risk, and are likely to have prevented safe compounds from reaching clinical phases. Although this has stimulated numerous efforts to define new paradigms for cardiac safety, none of the recently developed strategies accounts for patient conditions. In particular, despite being a well-established independent risk factor for TdP, female sex is vastly under-represented in both basic research and clinical studies, and thus current TdP metrics are likely biased toward the male sex. Here, we apply statistical learning to synthetic data, generated by simulating drug effects on cardiac myocyte models capturing male and female electrophysiology, to develop new sex-specific classification frameworks for TdP risk. We show that (i) TdP classifiers require different features in females vs. males; (ii) male-based classifiers perform more poorly when applied to female data; and (iii) female-based classifier performance is largely unaffected by acute effects of hormones (i.e., during various phases of the menstrual cycle). Notably, when predicting TdP risk of intermediate drugs on female simulated data, male-biased predictive models consistently underestimate TdP risk in women. Therefore, we conclude that pipelines for preclinical cardiotoxicity risk assessment should consider sex as a key variable to avoid potentially life-threatening consequences for the female population."

        "abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system fight-or-flight response is characterized by a rapid increase in heart rate, which is mediated by an increase in the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing rate of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. Sympathetic neurons stimulate sinoatrial myocytes (SAMs) by activating \u00ce\u00b2 adrenergic receptors (\u00ce\u00b2ARs) and increasing cAMP. The funny current (If) is among the cAMP-sensitive currents in SAMs. If is critical for pacemaker activity, however, its role in the fight-or-flight response remains controversial. In this study, we used AP waveform analysis, machine learning, and dynamic clamp experiments in acutely isolated SAMs from mice to quantitatively define the AP waveform changes and role of If in the fight-or-flight increase in AP firing rate. We found that while \u00ce\u00b2AR stimulation significantly altered nearly all AP waveform parameters, the increase in firing rate was only correlated with changes in a subset of parameters (diastolic duration, late AP duration, and diastolic depolarization rate). Dynamic clamp injection of the \u00ce\u00b2AR-sensitive component of If showed that it accounts for \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc41% of the fight-or-flight increase in AP firing rate and 60% of the decrease in the interval between APs. Thus, If is an essential contributor to the fight-or-flight increase in heart rate."

        "abstract": "AimsAtrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent clinical arrhythmia, is associated with atrial remodelling manifesting as acute and chronic alterations in expression, function, and regulation of atrial electrophysiological and Ca2+-handling processes. These AF-induced modifications crosstalk and propagate across spatial scales creating a complex pathophysiological network, which renders AF resistant to existing pharmacotherapies that predominantly target transmembrane ion channels. Developing innovative therapeutic strategies requires a systems approach to disentangle quantitatively the pro-arrhythmic contributions of individual AF-induced alterations.Methods and resultsHere, we built a novel computational framework for simulating electrophysiology and Ca2+-handling in human atrial cardiomyocytes and tissues, and their regulation by key upstream signalling pathways [i.e. protein kinase A (PKA), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)] involved in AF-pathogenesis. Populations of atrial cardiomyocyte models were constructed to determine the influence of subcellular ionic processes, signalling components, and regulatory networks on atrial arrhythmogenesis. Our results reveal a novel synergistic crosstalk between PKA and CaMKII that promotes atrial cardiomyocyte electrical instability and arrhythmogenic triggered activity. Simulations of heterogeneous tissue demonstrate that this cellular triggered activity is further amplified by CaMKII- and PKA-dependent alterations of tissue properties, further exacerbating atrial arrhythmogenesis.ConclusionsOur analysis reveals potential mechanisms by which the stress-associated adaptive changes turn into maladaptive pro-arrhythmic triggers at the cellular and tissue levels and identifies potential anti-AF targets. Collectively, our integrative approach is powerful and instrumental to assemble and reconcile existing knowledge into a systems network for identifying novel anti-AF targets and innovative approaches moving beyond the traditional ion channel-based strategy."

        "abstract": "The mechanisms resulting in resistance to next-generation antiandrogens in castration-resistant prostate cancer are incompletely understood. Numerous studies have determined that constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) signaling or full-length AR bypass mechanisms may contribute to the resistance. Previous studies established that AKR1C3 and AR-V7 play important roles in enzalutamide and abiraterone resistance. In the present study, we found that AKR1C3 increases AR-V7 expression in resistant prostate cancer cells through enhancing protein stability via activation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. AKR1C3 reprograms AR signaling in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. In addition, bioinformatical analysis of indomethacin-treated resistant cells revealed that indomethacin significantly activates the unfolded protein response, p53, and apoptosis pathways, and suppresses cell-cycle, Myc, and AR/ARV7 pathways. Targeting AKR1C3 with indomethacin significantly decreases AR/AR-V7 protein expression in vitro and in vivo through activation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. Our results suggest that the AKR1C3/AR-V7 complex collaboratively confers resistance to AR-targeted therapies in advanced prostate cancer."

        "abstract": "Wildland fires in Southern California can be divided into two categories: fall fires, which are typically driven by strong offshore Santa Ana winds, and summer fires, which occur with comparatively weak onshore winds and hot and dry weather. Both types of fire contribute significantly to annual burned area and economic loss. An improved understanding of the relationship between Southern California's meteorology and fire is needed to improve predictions of how fire will change in the future and to anticipate management needs. We used output from a regional climate model constrained by reanalysis observations to identify Santa Ana events and partition fires into those occurring during periods with and without Santa Ana conditions during 1959\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2009. We then developed separate empirical regression models for Santa Ana and non-Santa Ana fires to quantify the effects of meteorology on fire number and size. These models explained approximately 58% of the seasonal and interannual variation in the number of Santa Ana fires and 36% of the variation in non-Santa Ana fires. The number of Santa Ana fires increased during years when relative humidity during Santa Ana events and fall precipitation were below average, indicating that fuel moisture is a key controller of ignition. Relative humidity strongly affected Santa Ana fire size. Cumulative precipitation during the previous three winters was significantly correlated with the number of non-Santa Ana fires, presumably through increased fine fuel density and connectivity between infrastructure and nearby vegetation. Both relative humidity and the preceding wet season precipitation influenced non-Santa Ana fire size. Regression models driven by meteorology explained 57% of the temporal variation in Santa Ana burned area and 22% of the variation in non-Santa Ana burned area. The area burned by non-Santa Ana fires has increased steadily by 1.7% year\u00e2\u02c6\u20191&nbsp;since 1959 (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.006); the occurrence of extremely large Santa Ana fires has increased abruptly since 2003. Our results underscore the need to separately consider the fuel and meteorological controls on Santa Ana and non-Santa Ana fires when projecting climate change impacts on regional fire."

        "abstract": "The evaluation of the first available satellite-based global albedo product at 1-km resolution is essential for its application in climate studies. We evaluate the accuracy of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product using available field measurements at Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and Cloud and Radiation Testbed-Southern Great Plains (CART/SGP) stations and examine the consistency between the MODIS surface albedos and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) top-of-the-atmosphere albedos as well as historical global albedos from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. A comparison with the field measurements shows that the MODIS surface albedo generally meets an absolute accuracy requirement of 0.02 for our study sites during April-September 2001, with the root mean square errors less than 0.018. Larger differences appear in the winter season probably due to the increased heterogeneity of surface reflectivity in the presence of snow. To examine the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the validation of the MODIS albedos using fine resolution field measurements, we derive an intermediate albedo product from four Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30-m spatial resolution as a surrogate for the distributed field measurements. The surface albedo is relatively homogeneous over the study stations in growing seasons, and therefore the validation during April-September is supported. A case study over three SURFRAD stations reveals that the MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function model is able to capture the solar zenith angle dependence of surface albedo as shown by the field measurements. We also find that the MODIS surface shortwave albedo is consistent with the contemporary and collocated CERES top-of atmosphere albedos derived directly from broadband observations. The MODIS albedo is also well correlated with historical surface albedos derived from AVHRR and ERBE observations, and a high bias of 0.016 and a low bias of 0.034 compared to those of the latter albedos are reasonable considering the differences in instruments and retrieval algorithms as well as environmental changes."

        "abstract": "Mechanistic hypotheses about airborne infectious disease transmission have traditionally emphasized the role of coughing and sneezing, which are dramatic expiratory events that yield both easily visible droplets and large quantities of particles too small to see by eye. Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm3) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as \"speech superemitters,\" consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease."

        "abstract": "Animal models are often used to assess the airborne transmissibility of various pathogens, which are typically assumed to be carried by expiratory droplets emitted directly from the respiratory tract of the infected animal. We recently established that influenza virus is also transmissible via \"aerosolized fomites,\" micron-scale dust particulates released from virus-contaminated surfaces (Asadi et al. in Nat Commun 11(1):4062, 2020). Here we expand on this observation, by counting and characterizing the particles emitted from guinea pig cages using an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and an Interferometric Mie Imaging (IMI) system. Of over 9000 airborne particles emitted from guinea pig cages and directly imaged with IMI, none had an interference pattern indicative of a liquid droplet. Separate measurements of the particle count using the APS indicate that particle concentrations spike upwards immediately following animal motion, then decay exponentially with a time constant commensurate with the air exchange rate in the cage. Taken together, the results presented here raise the possibility that a non-negligible fraction of airborne influenza transmission events between guinea pigs occurs via aerosolized fomites rather than respiratory droplets, though the relative frequencies of these two routes have yet to be definitively determined."

        "abstract": "We recently performed a systematic investigation of consumer preferences for black coffee versus key brewing parameters, including total dissolved solids, extraction yield, and brewing temperature (Cotter et al. in J Food Sci 86(1):194-205, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15561 ). An experimental goal in that work was for participants to taste the coffee at a beverage temperature of 65&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C, but the large sample size of more than 3000 individual tastings, combined with natural variations in the brewing and cooling processes, meant that coffees were assessed over a normally distributed range of temperatures between 56 and 71&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C. Here we use those data to provide a more detailed analysis of the impact of beverage temperature on consumer acceptance of the coffee, with a key objective of identifying beverage temperatures at which no consumers assess the coffee either as too hot or too cold. Using a 5-point just-about-right (JAR) scale, we find that a majority of consumers (>\u00e2\u20ac\u203050%) assessed the temperature as JAR at all temperatures tested up to 70&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C. A substantial fraction of consumers, approximately 6-12%, assessed the coffee as too cold over the range 56-68&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C. Only above 70&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C did a majority of consumers assess the coffee as too hot and none assessed it as too cold, albeit with 40% still assessing it as JAR. Complementary analyses indicate that beverage temperature over this range had little impact on assessments of the adequacy of flavor intensity, acidity, and mouthfeel, but did correlate slightly with overall liking and purchase intent. Overall, the results suggest that temperatures over the range of 58-66&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C maximize consumer acceptance, and that 68-70&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C is the minimum temperature range at which no consumers will assess black coffee as too cold."

Naphthalene elicits region-specific toxicity in airway club cells through cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated bioactivation, resulting in depletion of glutathione and subsequent cytotoxicity. Although effects of naphthalene in mice have been extensively studied, few experiments have characterized global metabolomic changes in the lung. In individual lung regions, we found metabolomic changes in microdissected mouse lung conducting airways and parenchyma obtained from animals sacrificed at 3 timepoints following naphthalene treatment. Data on 577 unique identified metabolites were acquired by accurate mass spectrometry-based assays focusing on lipidomics and nontargeted metabolomics of hydrophilic compounds. Statistical analyses revealed distinct metabolite profiles between the 2 lung regions. Additionally, the number and magnitude of statistically significant exposure-induced changes in metabolite abundance were different between airways and parenchyma for unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines, dipeptides, purines, pyrimidines, and amino acids. Importantly, temporal changes were found to be highly distinct for male and female mice with males exhibiting predominant treatment-specific changes only at 2 h postexposure. In females, metabolomic changes persisted until 6 h postnaphthalene treatment, which may explain the previously characterized higher susceptibility of female mice to naphthalene toxicity. In both males and females, treatment-specific changes corresponding to lung remodeling, oxidative stress response, and DNA damage were observed. Overall, this study provides insights into potential mechanisms contributing to naphthalene toxicity and presents a novel approach for lung metabolomic analysis that distinguishes responses of major lung regions."

Here, we describe maturation media designed to provide oxidative substrates adapted to the metabolic needs of human iPSC (hiPSC)-CMs. Compared with conventionally cultured hiPSC-CMs, metabolically matured hiPSC-CMs contract with greater force and show an increased reliance on cardiac sodium (Na+) channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca2+) cycling. The media enhance the function, long-term survival, and sarcomere structures in engineered heart tissues. Use of the maturation media made it possible to reliably model two genetic cardiac diseases: long QT syndrome type 3 due to a mutation in the cardiac Na+ channel SCN5A and dilated cardiomyopathy due to a mutation in the RNA splicing factor RBM20. The maturation media should increase the fidelity of hiPSC-CMs as disease models."

We previously showed that RyR refractoriness plays a key role in the onset of SR Ca2+ alternans in the intact rabbit heart, which contributes to arrhythmogenic action potential duration (APD) alternans. Recent studies have also implicated impaired SERCA function, a key feature of heart failure, in cardiac alternans and arrhythmias. However, the relationship between reduced SERCA function and SR Ca2+ alternans is not well understood. Simultaneous optical mapping of transmembrane potential (Vm) and SR Ca2+ was performed in isolated rabbit hearts (n = 10) using the voltage-sensitive dye RH237 and the low-affinity Ca2+ indicator Fluo-5N-AM. Alternans was induced by rapid ventricular pacing. SERCA was inhibited with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; 1-10 \u00ce\u00bcM). SERCA inhibition (1, 5, and 10 \u00ce\u00bcM of CPA) resulted in dose-dependent slowing of SR Ca2+ reuptake, with the time constant (tau) increasing from 70.8 \u00c2\u00b1 3.5 ms at baseline to 85.5 \u00c2\u00b1 6.6, 129.9 \u00c2\u00b1 20.7, and 271.3 \u00c2\u00b1 37.6 ms, respectively (p < 0.05 vs. baseline for all doses). At fast pacing frequencies, CPA significantly increased the magnitude of SR Ca2+ and APD alternans, most strongly at 10 \u00ce\u00bcM (pacing cycle length = 220 ms: SR Ca2+ alternans magnitude: 57.1 \u00c2\u00b1 4.7 vs. 13.4 \u00c2\u00b1 8.9 AU; APD alternans magnitude 3.8 \u00c2\u00b1 1.9 vs. 0.2 \u00c2\u00b1 0.19 AU; p < 0.05 10 \u00ce\u00bcM of CPA vs. baseline for both). SERCA inhibition also promoted the emergence of spatially discordant alternans. Notably, at all CPA doses, alternation of SR Ca2+ release occurred prior to alternation of diastolic SR Ca2+ load as pacing frequency increased. Simultaneous optical mapping of SR Ca2+ and Vm in the intact rabbit heart revealed that SERCA inhibition exacerbates pacing-induced SR Ca2+ and APD alternans magnitude, particularly at fast pacing frequencies. Importantly, SR Ca2+ release alternans always occurred before the onset of SR Ca2+ load alternans. These findings suggest that even in settings of diminished SERCA function, relative refractoriness of RyR Ca2+ release governs the onset of intracellular Ca2+ alternans."

        "abstract": "\u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic (\u00ce\u00b2-AR) signaling is essential for the adaptation of the heart to exercise and stress. Chronic stress leads to the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase D (PKD). Unlike CaMKII, the effects of PKD on excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) remain unclear. To elucidate the mechanisms of PKD-dependent ECC regulation, we used hearts from cardiac-specific PKD1 knockout (PKD1 cKO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. We measured calcium transients (CaT), Ca2+ sparks, contraction and L-type Ca2+ current in paced cardiomyocytes under acute \u00ce\u00b2-AR stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO; 100&nbsp;nM). Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load was assessed by rapid caffeine (10&nbsp;mM) induced Ca2+ release. Expression and phosphorylation of ECC proteins phospholambam (PLB), troponin I (TnI), ryanodine receptor (RyR), sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) were evaluated by western blotting. At baseline, CaT amplitude and decay tau, Ca2+ spark frequency, SR Ca2+ load, L-type Ca2+ current, contractility, and expression and phosphorylation of ECC protein were all similar in PKD1 cKO vs. WT. However, PKD1 cKO cardiomyocytes presented a diminished ISO response vs. WT with less increase in CaT amplitude, slower [Ca2+]i decline, lower Ca2+ spark rate and lower RyR phosphorylation, but with similar SR Ca2+ load, L-type Ca2+ current, contraction and phosphorylation of PLB and TnI. We infer that the presence of PKD1 allows full cardiomyocyte \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic responsiveness by allowing optimal enhancement in SR Ca2+ uptake and RyR sensitivity, but not altering L-type Ca2+ current, TnI phosphorylation or contractile response. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which PKD1 is regulating RyR sensitivity. We conclude that the presence of basal PKD1 activity in cardiac ventricular myocytes contributes to normal \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic responses in Ca2+ handling."

Our objective was to evaluate the performance of the diffeomorphic demons (DD) non-rigid image registration method to spatially align 3D serial (pre- and post-contrast) dedicated breast computed tomography (CT), and longitudinally-acquired dedicated 3D breast CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT images.MethodsThe algorithmic parameters of the DD method were optimized for the alignment of dedicated breast CT images using training data and fixed. The performance of the method for image alignment was quantitatively evaluated using three separate data sets; (1) serial breast CT pre- and post-contrast images of 20 women, (2) breast CT images of 20 women acquired before and after repositioning the subject on the scanner, and (3) dedicated breast PET/CT images of 7 women undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy acquired pre-treatment and after 1 cycle of therapy.ResultsThe DD registration method outperformed no registration (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001) and conventional affine registration (p&nbsp;\u00e2\u2030\u00a4&nbsp;0.002) for serial and longitudinal breast CT and PET/CT image alignment. In spite of the large size of the imaging data, the computational cost of the DD method was found to be reasonable (3-5&nbsp;min).ConclusionsCo-registration of dedicated breast CT and PET/CT images can be performed rapidly and reliably using the DD method. This is the first study evaluating the DD registration method for the alignment of dedicated breast CT and PET/CT images."

METHODS:A total of 119 breast lesions from 104 noncontrast dedicated breast computed tomography images of women were used in this study. Volumetric segmentation was done using a seed-based segmentation algorithm and then a triangulated surface was extracted from the resulting segmentation. Total, mean, and Gaussian curvatures were then computed. Normalized curvatures were used as classification features. In addition, traditional image features were also extracted and a forward feature selection scheme was used to select the optimal feature set. Logistic regression was used as a classifier and leave-one-out cross-validation was utilized to evaluate the classification performances of the features. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC, area under curve) was used as a figure of merit. RESULTS:Among curvature measures, the normalized total curvature (CT) showed the best classification performance (AUC of 0.74), while the others showed no classification power individually. Five traditional image features (two shape, two margin, and one texture descriptors) were selected via the feature selection scheme and its resulting classifier achieved an AUC of 0.83. Among those five features, the radial gradient index (RGI), which is a margin descriptor, showed the best classification performance (AUC of 0.73). A classifier combining RGI and CT yielded an AUC of 0.81, which showed similar performance (i.e., no statistically significant difference) to the classifier with the above five traditional image features. Additional comparisons in AUC values between classifiers using different combinations of traditional image features and CT were conducted. The results showed that CT was able to replace the other four image features for the classification task. CONCLUSIONS:The normalized curvature measure contains useful information in classifying breast tumors. Using this, one can reduce the number of features in a classifier, which may result in more robust classifiers for different datasets."

        "title": "Discrimination tasks in simulated low-dose CT noise.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study reports the results of a set of discrimination experiments using simulated images that represent the appearance of subtle lesions in low-dose computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. Noise in these images has a characteristic ramp-spectrum before apodization by noise control filters. We consider three specific diagnostic features that determine whether a lesion is considered malignant or benign, two system-resolution levels, and four apodization levels for a total of 24 experimental conditions. PURPOSE: The goal of the investigation is to better understand how well human observers perform subtle discrimination tasks like these, and the mechanisms of that performance. We use a forced-choice psychophysical paradigm to estimate observer efficiency and classification images. These measures quantify how effectively subjects can read the images, and how they use images to perform discrimination tasks across the different imaging conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The simulated CT images used as stimuli in the psychophysical experiments are generated from high-resolution objects passed through a modulation transfer function (MTF) before down-sampling to the image-pixel grid. Acquisition noise is then added with a ramp noise-power spectrum (NPS), with subsequent smoothing through apodization filters. The features considered are lesion size, indistinct lesion boundary, and a nonuniform lesion interior. System resolution is implemented by an MTF with resolution (10% max.) of 0.47 or 0.58 cyc/mm. Apodization is implemented by a Shepp-Logan filter (Sinc profile) with various cutoffs. Six medically na\u00c3\u00afve subjects participated in the psychophysical studies, entailing training and testing components for each condition. Training consisted of staircase procedures to find the 80% correct threshold for each subject, and testing involved 2000 psychophysical trials at the threshold value for each subject. Human-observer performance is compared to the Ideal Observer to generate estimates of task efficiency. The significance of imaging factors is assessed using ANOVA. Classification images are used to estimate the linear template weights used by subjects to perform these tasks. Classification-image spectra are used to analyze subject weights in the spatial-frequency domain. RESULTS: Overall, average observer efficiency is relatively low in these experiments (10%-40%) relative to detection and localization studies reported previously. We find significant effects for feature type and apodization level on observer efficiency. Somewhat surprisingly, system resolution is not a significant factor. Efficiency effects of the different features appear to be well explained by the profile of the linear templates in the classification images. Increasingly strong apodization is found to both increase the classification-image weights and to increase the mean-frequency of the classification-image spectra. A secondary analysis of Unapodized classification images shows that this is largely due to observers undoing (inverting) the effects of apodization filters. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that human observers can be relatively inefficient at feature-discrimination tasks in ramp-spectrum noise. Observers appear to be adapting to frequency suppression implemented in apodization filters, but there are residual effects that are not explained by spatial weighting patterns. The studies also suggest that the mechanisms for improving performance through the application of noise-control filters may require further investigation."

The scar tissue is considered a major obstacle preventing regeneration both as a physical barrier and as a source for secretion of inhibitors of axonal regeneration. Understanding the mechanism of scar formation and how to control it may lead to effective SCI therapies. Using a compression-SCI model on adult transgenic mice, we demonstrate that the canonical Wnt/\u00ce\u00b2-catenin signaling reporter TOPgal (TCF/Lef1-lacZ) positive cells appeared at the lesion site by 5 days, peaked on 7 days, and diminished by 14 days post injury. Using various representative cell lineage markers, we demonstrate that, these transiently TOPgal positive cells are a group of Fibronectin(+);GFAP(-) fibroblast-like cells in the core scar region. Some of them are proliferative. These results indicate that Wnt/\u00ce\u00b2-catenin signaling may play a key role in fibrotic scar formation after traumatic spinal cord injury."

        "abstract": "We recently reported superior right ventricle (RV) performance in response to acute afterload challenge in lambs with a model of congenital heart disease with chronic left-to-right cardiac shunts. Compared with control animals, shunt lambs demonstrated increased contractility because of an enhanced Anrep effect (the slow increase in contractility following myocyte stretch). This advantageous physiological response may reflect preservation of a fetal phenotype, since the RV of shunt lambs remains exposed to increased pressure postnatally. Nitric oxide (NO) production by NO synthase (NOS) is activated by myocyte stretch and is a necessary intermediary of the Anrep response. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that NO signaling is increased in the RV of fetal lambs compared with controls and shunt lambs have persistence of this fetal pattern. An 8-mm graft was placed between the pulmonary artery and aorta in fetal lambs (shunt). NOS isoform expression, activity, and association with activating cofactors were determined in fetal tissue obtained during late-gestation and in 4-wk-old juvenile shunt and control lambs. We demonstrated increased RNA and protein expression of NOS isoforms and increased total NOS activity in the RV of both shunt and fetal lambs compared with control. We also found increased NOS activation and association with cofactors in shunt and fetal RV compared with control. These data demonstrate preserved fetal NOS phenotype and NO signaling in shunt RV, which may partially explain the mechanism underlying the adaptive response to increased afterload seen in the RV of shunt lambs."

The longitudinal trajectory of these impairments, however, remains unclear. Indeed, some studies have observed degeneration and others stability or even improvement over time in these illnesses. Here we examined the longitudinal stability of the AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT), a cognitive control task, in 52 patients with recent-onset SZ (<2 years from first study measurement), 20 patients with recent-onset BD Type I with psychotic features, and 70 healthy control subjects. Subjects performed the AX-CPT at 2 time points separated by an average of 365 days (range 270-620). Previously identified deficits in cognitive control were replicated in both patient groups. No effects of time or interactions between time and diagnosis were observed. Intraclass correlation coefficients also suggested AX-CPT performance was stable across time for all diagnostic groups. Although performance was stable on average, a positive association was noted between change in cognitive control and change in disorganization symptom severity across patient groups. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that deficits in cognitive control are present in both disorders and stable over the early course of psychotic illness. No evidence was observed for progression or deterioration of cognitive control or differential recovery in SZ compared to BD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)."

Participants were followed prospectively and completed comprehensive evaluations at 6, 12, and 24\u00e2\u20ac\u00afmonths, including the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) and the Global Social and Role Functioning Scales. The present analyses included 327 participants and examined the relationships between baseline symptoms and longitudinal global social and role functioning using a linear mixed modeling approach.ResultsHigher baseline negative symptoms and deteriorated thought process predicted worse social and role functioning in the follow-up period. The effect of negative symptoms on social functioning, however, was moderated by positive symptoms, and the relationship between positive symptoms and social functioning changed over time. Baseline positive symptoms, distress, and level of symptom severity were not predictors of either social or role functioning.ConclusionsBaseline negative symptoms and thought disorder appear to predict functional outcome for up to two years among adolescents and young adults at risk for psychosis. Developing effective interventions to target these symptoms may be critical to promote functional recovery among those experiencing attenuated symptoms or a first episode of psychosis."

Using a small training data\r\nset and an under 3-minute testing procedure, partial least squares regression (PLS) models were built\r\nand achieved a mean absolute error of 0.38% and 1.43% pack SoH for NCA and LFP packs, respectively.\r\nPLS models were also built that correctly categorized packs having low, medium, and high ranked SoH\r\nCtCV 72.5% and 65% of the time for NCA and LFP packs, respectively. This study further investigates the\r\nrelationships between pack SoH, SoH CtCV, and the voltage response of NCA and LFP packs. The slope of\r\nthe discharge voltage response of the NCA packs was shown to have a strong correlation with pack\r\ndynamics and pack SoH, and the lowest SoH cell within NCA packs was shown to dominate the dynamic\r\nresponse of the entire pack."

        "abstract": "Despite of the potential implications for cancer immunotherapy, conventional approaches using in vitro expanded CD8(+) T cells have suboptimal outcomes, mostly due to loss of functionality from cellular exhaustion. We therefore investigated the phenotypic and functional differences among in vitro activated CD8(+) T cells of three different sources, namely na\u00c3\u00afve (NTeff), memory (MTeff) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILeff) from human and mice, to better understand mechanisms behind potent effector functions and potential for overcoming current limitations. In line with the greater proliferation activity and longer telomere lengths of NTeff populations, cells of na\u00c3\u00afve origin exhibited significantly less amounts of T cell exhaustion markers than those of MTeff and TILeff, and moreover, acquired distinct expression patterns of memory-promoting transcription factors, T-bet and Eomes, induced in a rapid and sustainable manner. NTeff cells appeared to have lower expression of Foxp1 and were refractory to apoptosis upon TGF-\u00ce\u00b2 conditioning, implying better survival potential and resistance to tumor-induced immune suppression. Of CD8(+) T cell pools activated to tumor-specific CTLs, na\u00c3\u00afve cell generated effectors possessed the most potent cytotoxic activity, validating implications for use in rational design of adoptive immunotherapy."

        "abstract": "Like alternative splicing, leaky ribosomal scanning (LRS), which occurs at suboptimal translational initiation codons, increases the physiological flexibility of the genome by allowing alternative translation. Comprehensive analysis of 22 208 human mRNAs indicates that, although the most important positions relative to the first nucleotide of the initiation codon, -3 and +4, are usually such that support initiation (A-3 = 42%, G-3 = 36% and G+4 = 47%), only 37.4% of the genes adhere to the purine (R)-3/G+4 rule at both positions simultaneously, suggesting that LRS may occur in some of the remaining (62.6%) genes. Moreover, 12.5% of the genes lack both R-3 and G+4, potentially leading to sLRS. Compared with 11 genes known to undergo LRS, 10 genes with experimental evidence for high fidelity A+1T+2G+3 initiation codons adhered much more strongly to the R-3/G+4 rule. Among the intron-less histone genes, only the H3 genes adhere to the R-3/G+4 rule, while the H1, H2A, H2B and H4 genes usually lack either R-3 or G+4. To address in vivo the significance of the previously described LRS of H4 mRNAs, which results in alternative translation of the osteogenic growth peptide, transgenic mice were engineered that ubiquitously and constitutively express a mutant H4 mRNA with an A+1T+1 mutation. These transgenic mice, in particular the females, have a high bone mass phenotype, attributable to increased bone formation. These data suggest that many genes may fulfill cryptic functions by LRS."

        "abstract": "The trabecular meshwork (TM) of the eye plays a critical role in modulating intraocular pressure (IOP) through regulation of aqueous humor outflow, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Ethacrynic acid, an agent known to inhibit Na-K-Cl cotransport of a number of cell types, recently has been reported to increase aqueous outflow and lower IOP through an unknown effect on the TM. In vascular endothelial cells and a variety of ether cell types, the Na-K-Cl cotransporter functions to regulate intracellular volume. The present study was conducted to evaluate TM cells for the presence of Na-K-Cl cotransport activity and to test the hypothesis that modulation of cotransport activity alters intracellular volume and, consequently, permeability of the TM. We demonstrate here that bovine and human TM cells exhibit robust Na-K-Cl cotransport activity that is inhibited by bumetanide and by ethacrynic acid. Our studies also show that TM cell Na- K-Cl cotransport is modulated by a variety of hormones and neurotransmitters. Inhibition of the cotransporter either by bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, or inhibitory hormones reduces TM intracellular volume, whereas stimulatory hormones increase cell volume. In addition, shrinkage of the cells by hypertonic media stimulates cotransport activity and initiates a subsequent regulatory volume increase. Permeability of TM cell monolayers, assessed as transmonolayer flux of [14C]sucrose, is increased by hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage and by bumetanide. These findings suggest that Na-K-Cl cotransport of TM cells is of central importance to regulation of intracellular volume and TM permeability. Defects of Na-K-Cl cotransport may underlie the pathophysiology of glaucoma."

One of the fundamental aspects of over-parametrized models is that they are capable of interpolating the training data. We show that, under interpolation-like assumptions satisfied by the stochastic gradients in an over-parametrization setting, the first-order oracle complexity of Perturbed Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) algorithm to reach an ?-local-minimizer, matches the corresponding deterministic rate of \u00c3\u2022(1/ ?2). We next analyze Stochastic Cubic-Regularized Newton (SCRN) algorithm under interpolation-like conditions, and show that the oracle complexity to reach an ?-local-minimizer under interpolation-like conditions, is \u00c3\u2022(1/ ?2.5). While this obtained complexity is better than the corresponding complexity of either PSGD, or SCRN without interpolation-like assumptions, it does not match the rate of \u00c3\u2022(1/ ?1.5) corresponding to deterministic Cubic-Regularized Newton method. It seems further Hessian-based interpolation-like assumptions are necessary to bridge this gap. We also discuss the corresponding improved complexities in the zeroth-order settings."

When used in a microring resonator structure, the filled overcladding slotted waveguide and the unfilled (air-filled) overcladding slotted waveguide can both achieve athermal characteristics. Simulations indicate a wide range of realizations with proper design parameters of the slotted waveguides, namely, the silicon strip and slot widths. Preliminary experimental results on fabricated devices demonstrate that the temperature dependence is reduced from 91&nbsp;pm/\u00c2\u00b0C for a regular microring resonator to 52 pm/\u00c2\u00b0C for the PMMA-clad microring resonator. Completely athermal realization is expectable in similar devices with improved fabrication techniques. For the external optical source, we demonstrate a stable 3.5 THz wide (175&nbsp;modes\u00c3\u201420 GHz) optical comb source with nearly flat spectral phase. Adjustable mode spacing and wavelength tunability across the C-band are maintained so that comb lines can be matched to the specified wavelength grid of the computing system. With such schemes, temperature controls of individual optical components in the optically interconnected computing chips become unnecessary, greatly reducing the complexity of the computing system."

        "abstract": "Progress in computing architectures is approaching a paradigm shift: traditional computing based on digital complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology is nearing physical limits in terms of miniaturization, speed, and, especially, power consumption. Consequently, alternative approaches are under investigation. One of the most promising is based on a \"brain-like\" or neuromorphic computation scheme. Another approach is quantum computing using photons. Both of these approaches can be realized using silicon photonics, and at the heart of both technologies is an efficient, ultra-low power broad band optical modulator. As silicon modulators suffer from relatively high power consumption, materials other than silicon itself have to be considered for the modulator. In this Perspective, we present our view on such materials. We focus on oxides showing a strong linear electro-optic effect that can also be integrated with Si, thus capitalizing on new materials to enable the devices and circuit architectures that exploit shifting computational machine learning paradigms, while leveraging current manufacturing infrastructure. This is expected to result in a new generation of computers that consume less power and possess a larger bandwidth."

        "abstract": "PIWI proteins and their bound PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are found in animal germlines and are essential for fertility, but their functions outside of the gonad are not well understood. The cnidarian Hydra is a simple metazoan with well-characterized stem/progenitor cells that provides a unique model for analysis of PIWI function. Here we report that Hydra has two PIWI proteins, Hydra PIWI (Hywi) and Hydra PIWI-like (Hyli), both of which are expressed in all Hydra stem/progenitor cells, but not in terminally differentiated cells. We identified \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc15 million piRNAs associated with Hywi and/or Hyli and found that they exhibit the ping-pong signature of piRNA biogenesis. Hydra PIWI proteins are strictly cytoplasmic and thus likely act as posttranscriptional regulators. To explore this function, we generated a Hydra transcriptome for piRNA mapping. piRNAs map to transposons with a 25- to 35-fold enrichment compared with the abundance of transposon transcripts. By sequencing the small RNAs specific to the interstitial, ectodermal, and endodermal lineages, we found that the targeting of transposons appears to be largely restricted to the interstitial lineage. We also identified putative nontransposon targets of the pathway unique to each lineage. Finally we demonstrate that hywi function is essential in the somatic epithelial lineages. This comprehensive analysis of the PIWI-piRNA pathway in the somatic stem/progenitor cells of a nonbilaterian animal suggests that this pathway originated with broader stem cell functionality."

        "abstract": "The epithelial and interstitial stem cells of the freshwater polyp Hydra are the best-characterized stem cell systems in any cnidarian, providing valuable insight into cell type evolution and the origin of stemness in animals. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that determine how these stem cells are maintained and how they give rise to their diverse differentiated progeny. To address such questions, a thorough understanding of transcriptional regulation in Hydra is needed. To this end, we generated extensive new resources for characterizing transcriptional regulation in Hydra, including new genome assemblies for Hydra oligactis and the AEP strain of Hydra vulgaris, an updated whole-animal single-cell RNA-seq atlas, and genome-wide maps of chromatin interactions, chromatin accessibility, sequence conservation, and histone modifications. These data revealed the existence of large kilobase-scale chromatin interaction domains in the Hydra genome that contain transcriptionally coregulated genes. We also uncovered the transcriptomic profiles of two previously molecularly uncharacterized cell types: isorhiza-type nematocytes and somatic gonad ectoderm. Finally, we identified novel candidate regulators of cell type-specific transcription, several of which have likely been conserved at least since the divergence of Hydra and the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica more than 400 million years ago."

The following elements were analyzed: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Ba, Th, Nb, Y, Hf, Ta, U, Pb, Rb, Cs, Sr, Sc, and Zr. Trace element data indicate that the igneous basement at Site 1256 is geochemically normal mid-ocean-ridge basalt. A massive ponded flow sampled in both Holes 1256C and 1256D is distinguished by higher abundances of rare earth elements (REE) and most of the other trace elements analyzed. One interval of highly altered basalt has significantly higher concentrations of Cs, Rb, and Ba and lower concentrations of Sr, Pb, Zr, Hf, Sc, and most REE than the samples of background alteration or halos. No correlation is obvious between trace element abundance and macroscopic type of alteration within the background alteration or halos."

The RecQ helicase is involved in repairing damage caused by DNA breaks and stalled replication forks via homologous recombination. Here, the helicase activity of RecQ was visualized on single molecules of DNA using a fluorescent sensor that directly detects ssDNA. By monitoring the formation and progression of individual unwinding forks, we observed that both the frequency of initiation and the rate of unwinding are highly dependent on RecQ concentration. We establish that unwinding forks can initiate internally by melting dsDNA and can proceed in both directions at up to 40-60 bp/s. The findings suggest that initiation requires a RecQ dimer, and that continued processive unwinding of several kilobases involves multiple monomers at the DNA unwinding fork. We propose a distinctive model wherein RecQ melts dsDNA internally to initiate unwinding and subsequently assembles at the fork into a distribution of multimeric species, each encompassing a broad distribution of rates, to unwind DNA. These studies define the species that promote resection of DNA, proofreading of homologous pairing, and migration of Holliday junctions, and they suggest that various functional forms of RecQ can be assembled that unwind at rates tailored to the diverse biological functions of RecQ helicase."

While moderate dosages of chemotherapeutic agents such as busulfan may increase hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) engraftment, they are not immune suppressive and do not abrogate immune responses to transgene products. Studies focused on nonmyeloablative conditioning with busulfan \u00c2\u00b1 fludarabine in a clinically relevant monkey model to induce immune suppression to allow cells expressing a foreign transgene product to persist. Bone marrow CD34+ HSC were transduced in two equal fractions using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-based lentiviral vectors carrying a nonexpressed DNA sequence tag (NoN) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. Post-transplant there was no evidence of elimination of cells containing the potentially immunogenic GFP gene; several recipients had stable persistence of cells, and no differences were detected with fludarabine, which was rapidly cleared. Antibodies and cellular immune responses to GFP developed in recipients with the highest levels of GFP-marked cells, although these cells were not eliminated. These studies establish a clinically relevant pediatric primate model to assess the effects of conditioning regimens on the engraftment of transduced HSC and the immune responses to cells expressing a foreign gene product."

The 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced murine oral and esophageal cancer model is frequently used to assess the effects of preventive and/or therapeutic agents. We used this model to assess the impact of the microbiome on tumorigenesis using axenic (germ-free) and conventionally housed mice. Increased toxicity was observed in germ-free mice, however, no difference in tumor incidence, multiplicity, and size was observed. Transcriptional profiling of liver tissue from germ-free and conventionally housed mice identified 254 differentially expressed genes including ten cytochrome p450 enzymes, the largest family of phase-1 drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Gene ontology revealed that differentially expressed genes were enriched for liver steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in livers of germ-free mice. Our observations emphasize the importance of the microbiome in mediating chemical toxicity at least in part by altering host gene expression. Studies on the role of the microbiome in chemical-induced cancer using germ-free animal models should consider the potential difference in dose due to the microbiome-mediated changes in host metabolizing capacity, which might influence the ability to draw conclusions especially for tumor induction models that are dose dependent."

        "abstract": "Managing patients with kidney allografts largely depends on biopsy diagnosis which is based on semiquantitative assessments of rejection features and extent of acute and chronic changes within the renal parenchyma. Current methods lack reproducibility while digital image data-driven computational models enable comprehensive and quantitative assays. In this study we aimed to develop a computational method for automated assessment of histopathology transformations within the tubulointerstitial compartment of the renal cortex. Whole slide images of modified Picrosirius red-stained biopsy slides were used for the training (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030852) and both internal (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030172) and external (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203094) tests datasets. The pipeline utilizes deep learning segmentations of renal tubules, interstitium, and peritubular capillaries from which morphometry features were extracted. Seven indicators were selected for exploring the intrinsic spatial interactions within the tubulointerstitial compartment. A principal component analysis revealed two independent factors which can be interpreted as representing chronic and acute tubulointerstitial injury. A K-means clustering classified biopsies according to potential phenotypes of combined acute and chronic transformations of various degrees. We conclude that multivariate analyses of tubulointerstitial morphometry transformations enable extraction of and quantification of acute and chronic components of injury. The method is developed for renal allograft biopsies; however, the principle can be applied more broadly for kidney pathology assessment."

However, when NA is used to treat dyslipidemias, it causes a strong side effect of cutaneous vasodilation, commonly called flushing. A recent study showed that NA may cause flushing by lowering activation threshold temperature of the heat-sensitive capsaicin receptor TRPV1 ion channel, leading to its activation at body temperature. The finding calls into question whether NA might also interact with the homologous heat-sensitive TRPV2-4 channels, particularly given that TRPV3 and TRPV4 are abundantly expressed in keratinocytes of the skin where much of the flushing response occurs. We found that NA indeed potentiated TRPV3 while inhibited TRPV2 and TRPV4. Consistent with these gating effects, NA lowered the heat-activation threshold of TRPV3 but elevated that of TRPV4. We further found that activity of TRPV1 was substantially prolonged by extracellular NA, which may further enhance the direct activation effect. Consistent with the broad gating effect on TRPV1-4 channels, evidence from the present study hints that NA may share the same activation pathway as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a common agonist for these TRPV channels. These findings shed new light on the molecular mechanism underlying NA regulation of TRPV channels."

        "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is characterized by abnormal mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) handling, energy failure and impaired mitophagy resulting in contractile dysfunction and myocyte death. We have previously shown that the 18-kDa mitochondrial translocator protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TSPO) can modulate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Experiments were designed to test the role of the TSPO in a murine pressure-overload model of HF induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Conditional, cardiac-specific TSPO knockout (KO) mice were generated using the Cre-loxP system. TSPO-KO and wild-type (WT) mice underwent TAC for 8 weeks. TAC-induced HF significantly increased TSPO expression in WT mice, associated with a marked reduction in systolic function, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, complex I activity and energetics. In contrast, TSPO-KO mice undergoing TAC had preserved ejection fraction, and exhibited fewer clinical signs of HF and fibrosis. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and energetics were restored in TSPO KO mice, associated with decreased ROS, improved complex I activity and preserved mitophagy. Thus, HF increases TSPO expression, while preventing this increase limits the progression of HF, preserves ATP production and decreases oxidative stress, thereby preventing metabolic failure. These findings suggest that pharmacological interventions directed at TSPO may provide novel therapeutics to prevent or treat HF."

The results indicated that the response of the sensors increased by three to four orders of magnitude with increasing the relative humidity (RH) from 8 to 95% at room temperature, exhibiting high sensitivity and that, in the range of 20-95% RH, the Log(\u00ce\u201df) showed a good linearity. Additionally, the prepared sensors exhibited remarkably enhanced sensitivity with increasing the coating loads of polyelectrolytes on QCM. Furthermore, the dynamic Langmuir adsorption model was used to determine the kinetic parameters such as adsorption rates and Gibbs free energy for various RH between 70 and 95%. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The results show that the alloy has the maximum value of strength after peak-aged. The over-aged alloy has the best corrosion resistance, and the under-aged alloy has the best elongation. The sensitivities order of the intergranular corrosion and the exfoliation corrosion from high to low is under-aged, peak-aged and over-aged. This is because that after over-aging, the electrode potential of matrix is increased with a lot of precipitations precipitates from intragranular, meanwhile there are sparsely distributed precipitates and narrow precipitate free zone (PFZ) along grain boundaries, which decrease the anode channel of intergranular corrosion."

        "title": "Effects of Tantalum Doping on Friction and Corrosion Behavior of Multilayer Ta-DLC Films",
        "abstract": "Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are widely applied in material protection due to high hardness, excellent wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. To solve the problem that 316L stainless steel is prone to wear and corrosion in the environment of marine friction and corrosion, Ta/TaN/TaCN/Ta-DLC films were deposited on 316L stainless steel by mid-frequency magnetron sputtering technology. The surface morphology, cross-sectional morphology, and corrosion morphology of the prepared films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to analyze the electronic structure of carbon element, chemical bond information, and phase composition in DLC films, respectively. The tribological and mechanical properties were tested by scratch method, nanoindentation test, and friction and wear test. The corrosion resistance of the films was tested by the electrochemical method. The effect of Ta element content in DLC film on the structure, composition, mechanical properties, tribological properties and corrosion resistance of the film was studied. The results showed that all films had a smooth surface and small surface cluster particles. When the doping content of Ta element was 2.04at.%, there were defects on the surface of the film. With the content of Ta element increased from 2.04at.% to 4.16at.%, the sp3 carbon in the film showed a trend of firstly increasing and then decreasing. The content of sp3 carbon in the film was the highest when the Ta content was 3.60at.%. The Ta element was mainly present in the forms of TaO and TaC in the surface DLC layer. Ta doping had little effect on film adhesion, and the adhesion of all films was about 10 N. When the Ta element doping content was 2.04at.%, the adhesion decreased slightly due to obvious defects in the film. With the increase of the doping content of Ta element in the Ta-DLC layer, the nano-hardness and elastic modulus of the films showed a trend of firstly increasing and then decreasing, which was consistent with the changing trend of sp3 carbon content in the Ta-DLC film, indicating that the change of carbon electronic structure in the Ta-DLC film layer played a major role in the nano-hardness of the film. The average friction coefficient of 316L stainless steel was 0.87, and the friction coefficient of the prepared film was generally between 0.21-0.43. Under the action of low load, the film had a good protective effect on 316L stainless steel. In addition, with the increase of the Ta element content, the average friction coefficient of the films gradually decreased, reaching a minimum of 0.21 at 4.16at.%. When the Ta element content was 3.60at.%, the corrosion current density and passivation current density of the film were 0.006 \u00ce\u00bcA/cm2 and 0.63 \u00ce\u00bcA/cm2, respectively, which were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than other films, and its film resistance and charge transfer resistance were the largest, showing the most excellent corrosion resistance. In short, the doping of the Ta element improves the friction resistance of Ta/TaN/TaCN/Ta-DLC film, and the appropriate doping amount of the Ta element can improve the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of Ta/TaN/TaCN/Ta-DLC film."

Ascending auditory information courses through these structures via topographic axonal projections. Little is known about the molecular composition of projection neurons or their postsynaptic targets. To visualize axodendritic contacts between identified cell types, we used double-label immunohistochemistry, in vivo retrograde tracing, in vitro anterograde tracing, high-resolution confocal microscopy, three-dimensional reconstruction and fly-through visualization. We discovered a major class of IC neurons that strongly expressed calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II, alpha subunit (CaMKII). The distribution of these cells within the IC was mostly restricted to the external nucleus of the IC (ICX), in which the auditory space map is assembled. A large proportion of ICX-OT projection neurons were CaMKII positive. In addition to being the principal outputs, CaMKII cells were in direct contact with axonal boutons emanating from the main source of input to ICX, the lateral shell of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICCls). Numerous sites of putative synaptic contact were found on the somata, proximal dendrites, and distal dendrites. Double-label immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the existence of synapses between ICCls axons and the dendrites of CaMKII cells. Collectively, our data indicate that CaMKII ICX neurons are a cellular locus for the computation of auditory space-specific responses. Because the ICCls-ICX projection is physically altered during experience-dependent plasticity, these results lay the groundwork for probing microanatomical rearrangements that may underlie plasticity and learning."

        "abstract": "BackgroundRenal transplants (Tx) are performed infrequently in infants, due to concerns related to poor outcomes. The aim of our study was to compare graft failure rates in infant (<1 y) renal Tx recipients compared with older children.MethodsRetrospective cohort study of pediatric renal Tx recipients from 2000 to 2015, using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network database. A log-linear event history regression model for time to graft failure, adjusting for age group and important confounders, was used to estimate post-Tx graft failure probabilities.ResultsIn 2696 Tx followed for a median of 6.1 y, 704 failures were observed. Significant predictors of graft failure were year of Tx (for each year after 2000, rates were 8.6% lower), Black race-ethnicity (63% higher compared with Whites), and number of HLA matches. For infants (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203027), estimated graft failure percentage (95% confidence interval) within the first 1-, 2-, and 5-y post-Tx were 10.4 (0.1-21.1), 11.9 (1.2-22.6), and 16.4 (4.9-27.9). For the 1- to 11-y-olds (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20301429), these were 3.8 (3.0-4.6), 6.3 (5.4-7.3), and 13.6 (12.2-15.0), respectively, and for the 12+ y olds (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20301240), they were 3.8 (3.1-4.5), 8.1 (7.2-9.0), and 19.9 (18.1-21.7), respectively (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001 for 5-y graft failure rate across age groups).ConclusionsInfant renal Tx recipients experience a higher graft failure rate in the first year, compared with older cohorts, but over longer intervals, cumulative failure rates are comparable or even lower. To minimize early graft losses such Tx should be performed in experienced centers."

        "abstract": "We introduce and implement interferometric near-infrared spectroscopy (iNIRS), which simultaneously extracts optical and dynamical properties of turbid media through analysis of a spectral interference fringe pattern. The spectral interference fringe pattern is measured using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a frequency-swept narrow linewidth laser. Fourier analysis of the detected signal is used to determine time-of-flight (TOF)-resolved intensity, which is then analyzed over time to yield TOF-resolved intensity autocorrelations. This approach enables quantification of optical properties, which is not possible in conventional, continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Furthermore, iNIRS quantifies scatterer motion based on TOF-resolved autocorrelations, which is a feature inaccessible by well-established diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) techniques. We prove this by determining TOF-resolved intensity and temporal autocorrelations for light transmitted through diffusive fluid phantoms with optical thicknesses of up to 55 reduced mean free paths (approximately 120 scattering events). The TOF-resolved intensity is used to determine optical properties with time-resolved diffusion theory, while the TOF-resolved intensity autocorrelations are used to determine dynamics with diffusing wave spectroscopy. iNIRS advances the capabilities of diffuse optical methods and is suitable for in vivo tissue characterization. Moreover, iNIRS combines NIRS and DCS capabilities into a single modality."

        "abstract": "Light-scattering methods are widely used in soft matter physics and biomedical optics to probe dynamics in turbid media, such as diffusion in colloids or blood flow in biological tissue. These methods typically rely on fluctuations of coherent light intensity, and therefore cannot accommodate more than a few modes per detector. This limitation has hindered efforts to measure deep tissue blood flow with high speed, since weak diffuse light fluxes, together with low single-mode fiber throughput, result in low photon count rates. To solve this, we introduce multimode fiber (MMF) interferometry to the field of diffuse optics. In doing so, we transform a standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera into a sensitive detector array for weak light fluxes that probe deep in biological tissue. Specifically, we build a novel CMOS-based, multimode interferometric diffusing wave spectroscopy (iDWS) system and show that it can measure \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc20 speckles simultaneously near the shot noise limit, acting essentially as \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc20 independent photon-counting channels. We develop a matrix formalism, based on MMF mode field solutions and detector geometry, to predict both coherence and speckle number in iDWS. After validation in liquid phantoms, we demonstrate iDWS pulsatile blood flow measurements at 2.5 cm source-detector separation in the adult human brain in vivo. By achieving highly sensitive and parallel measurements of coherent light fluctuations with a CMOS camera, this work promises to enhance performance and reduce cost of diffuse optical instruments."

Interferometric diffuse optics (iDO) promises to improve the quantitative accuracy and depth specificity of DO, and particularly, coherent light fluctuations (CLFs) arising from blood flow. iDO techniques have alternatively achieved either time-of-flight (TOF) discrimination or highly parallel detection, but not both at once. Here, we break this barrier with a single iDO instrument. Specifically, we show that rapid tuning of a temporally coherent laser during the sensor integration time increases the effective linewidth seen by a highly parallel interferometer. Using this concept to create a continuously variable and user-specified TOF filter, we demonstrate a solution to the canonical problem of DO, measuring optical properties. Then, with a deep TOF filter, we reduce scalp sensitivity of CLFs by 2.7 times at 1 cm source-collector separation. With this unique combination of desirable features, i.e., TOF-discrimination, spatial localization, and highly parallel CLF detection, we perform multiparametric imaging of light intensities and CLFs via the human forehead."

This work presents a series of optimization methods that can significantly reduce the time to scan an OI-RD image. The wait time for the lock-in amplifier was decreased by the proper selection of the time constant and development of a new electronic amplifier. In addition, the time for the software to acquire data and for translation stage movement was also minimized. As a result, the detection speed of the OI-RD microscope is 10 times faster than before, making the OI-RD microscope suitable for ultra-high throughput screening applications."

        "abstract": "The morphological evolution of nanoporous gold is generally believed to be governed by surface diffusion. This work specifically explores the dependence of mass transport by surface diffusion on the curvature of a gold surface. The surface diffusivity is estimated by molecular dynamics simulations for a variety of surfaces of constant mean curvature, eliminating any chemical potential gradients and allowing the possible dependence of the surface diffusivity on mean curvature to be isolated. The apparent surface diffusivity is found to have an activation energy of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc0.74 eV with a weak dependence on curvature, but is consistent with the values reported in the literature. The apparent concentration of mobile surface atoms is found to be highly variable, having an Arrhenius dependence on temperature with an activation energy that also has a weak curvature dependence. These activation energies depend on curvature in such a way that the rate of mass transport by surface diffusion is nearly independent of curvature, but with a higher activation energy of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc1.01 eV. The curvature dependencies of the apparent surface diffusivity and concentration of mobile surface atoms is believed to be related to the expected lifetime of a mobile surface atom, and has the practical consequence that a simulation study that does not account for this finite lifetime could underestimate the activation energy for mass transport via surface diffusion by \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc0.27 eV."

        "abstract": "UnlabelledSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can cross the epithelial barrier using either the invasion-associated type III secretion system (T3SS-1) or a T3SS-1-independent mechanism that remains poorly characterized. Here we show that flagellum-mediated motility supported a T3SS-1-independent pathway for entering ileal Peyer's patches in the mouse model. Flagellum-dependent invasion of Peyer's patches required energy taxis toward nitrate, which was mediated by the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) Tsr. Generation of nitrate in the intestinal lumen required inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which was synthesized constitutively in the mucosa of the terminal ileum but not in the jejunum, duodenum, or cecum. Tsr-mediated invasion of ileal Peyer's patches was abrogated in mice deficient for Nos2, the gene encoding iNOS. We conclude that Tsr-mediated energy taxis enables S&nbsp;Typhimurium to migrate toward the intestinal epithelium by sensing host-derived nitrate, thereby contributing to invasion of Peyer's patches.ImportanceNontyphoidal Salmonella serovars, such as S.&nbsp;enterica serovar Typhimurium, are a common cause of gastroenteritis in immunocompetent individuals but can also cause bacteremia in immunocompromised individuals. While the invasion-associated type III secretion system (T3SS-1) is important for entry, S&nbsp;Typhimurium strains lacking a functional T3SS-1 can still cross the intestinal epithelium and cause a disseminated lethal infection in mice. Here we observed that flagellum-mediated motility and chemotaxis contributed to a T3SS-1-independent pathway for invasion and systemic dissemination to the spleen. This pathway required the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) Tsr and energy taxis toward host-derived nitrate, which we found to be generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the ileal mucosa prior to infection. Collectively, our data suggest that S&nbsp;Typhimurium enhances invasion by actively migrating toward the intestinal epithelium along a gradient of host-derived nitrate emanating from the mucosal surface of the ileum."

        "abstract": "Treatment of intracellular bacterial pathogens with antibiotic therapy often requires a long course of multiple drugs. A barrier to developing strategies that enhance antibiotic efficacy against these pathogens is our poor understanding of the intracellular nutritional environment that maintains bacterial persistence. The intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus survives and replicates preferentially in alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs); however, knowledge of the metabolic adaptations promoting exploitation of this niche is limited. Here we show that one mechanism promoting enhanced survival in AAMs is a shift in macrophage arginine utilization from production of nitric oxide (NO) to biosynthesis of polyamines, induced by interleukin 4 (IL-4)/IL-13 treatment. Production of polyamines by infected AAMs promoted both intracellular survival of B. abortus and chronic infection in mice, as inhibition of macrophage polyamine synthesis or inactivation of the putative putrescine transporter encoded by potIHGF reduced both intracellular survival in AAMs and persistence in mice. These results demonstrate that increased intracellular availability of polyamines induced by arginase-1 expression in IL-4/IL-13-induced AAMs promotes chronic persistence of B. abortus within this niche and suggest that targeting of this pathway may aid in eradicating chronic infection."

In contrast to patients with therapy-related MDS with 5q deletions, 5q- syndrome patients have a favourable prognosis and a low rate of transformation to acute leukaemia. We have previously delineated a common deleted region of 5.6 Mb between the gene for fibroblast growth factor acidic (FGF1) and the subunit of interleukin 12 (IL12B) in two patients with 5q- syndrome and small deletions, del(5)(q31q33). The present study used fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of these and a third 5q- syndrome patient with a small deletion, del(5)(q33q34), to refine further the critical deleted region. This resulted in the narrowing of the common deleted region within 5q31.3-5q33 to approximately 3 Mb, flanked by the adrenergic receptor beta 2 (ADRB2) and IL/2B genes. The common region of loss in these three 5q- syndrome patients includes the macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R), secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich (SPARC), and glutamate receptor (GR1A1) genes. This 5q- syndrome critical region is telomeric to and distinct from the other critical regions on 5q associated with MDS and acute myeloid leukaemia."

Diabetes and mineralocorticoid excess are common and important pathophysiological factors that may synergistically promote HFpEF. The authors aimed to develop a novel animal model of HFpEF that recapitulates key aspects of the complex human phenotype with multiorgan impairments. Methods and Results The authors created a novel HFpEF model combining leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice with a 4-week period of aldosterone infusion. The HFpEF phenotype was assessed using morphometry, echocardiography, Ca2+ handling, and electrophysiology. The sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor empagliflozin was then tested for reversing the arrhythmogenic cardiomyocyte phenotype. Continuous aldosterone infusion for 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2030weeks in db/db mice induced marked diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction, cardiac hypertrophy, high levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, and significant extracardiac comorbidities (including severe obesity, diabetes with marked hyperglycemia, pulmonary edema, and vascular dysfunction). Aldosterone or db/db alone induced only a mild diastolic dysfunction without congestion. At the cellular level, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, prolonged Ca2+ transient decay, and arrhythmogenic action potential remodeling (prolongation, increased short-term variability, delayed afterdepolarizations), and enhanced late Na+ current were observed in aldosterone-treated db/db mice. All of these arrhythmogenic changes were reversed by empagliflozin pretreatment of HFpEF cardiomyocytes. Conclusions The authors conclude that the db/db+aldosterone model may represent a distinct clinical subgroup of HFpEF that has marked hyperglycemia, obesity, and increased arrhythmia risk. This novel HFpEF model can be useful in future therapeutic testing and should provide unique opportunities to better understand disease pathobiology."

We profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in Pogz-/- mice and show that POGZ promotes the active chromatin state and transcription of clustered synaptic genes. We further demonstrate that POGZ forms a nuclear complex and co-occupies loci with ADNP, another high-confidence ASD risk gene, and provide evidence that POGZ regulates other neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes as well.

        "abstract": "Persistent over-activation of CaMKII (Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent protein Kinase II) in the heart is implicated in arrhythmias, heart failure, pathological remodeling, and other cardiovascular diseases. Several post-translational modifications (PTMs)-including autophosphorylation, oxidation, S-nitrosylation, and O-GlcNAcylation-have been shown to trap CaMKII in an autonomously active state. The molecular mechanisms by which these PTMs regulate calmodulin (CaM) binding to CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4-the primary cardiac isoform-has not been well-studied particularly in its native myocyte environment. Typically, CaMKII activates upon Ca-CaM binding during locally elevated [Ca]free and deactivates upon Ca-CaM dissociation when [Ca]free returns to basal levels. To assess the effects of CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4 PTMs on CaM binding, we developed a novel FRET (F\u00c3\u00b6rster resonance energy transfer) approach to directly measure CaM binding to and dissociation from CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4 in live cardiac myocytes. We demonstrate that autophosphorylation of CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4 increases affinity for CaM in its native environment and that this increase is dependent on [Ca]free. This leads to a 3-fold slowing of CaM dissociation from CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4 (time constant slows from ~0.5 to 1.5&nbsp;s) when [Ca]free is reduced with physiological kinetics. Moreover, oxidation further slows CaM dissociation from CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4 T287D (phosphomimetic) upon rapid [Ca]free chelation and increases FRET between CaM and CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4 T287A (phosphoresistant). The CaM dissociation kinetics-measured here in myocytes-are similar to the interval between heartbeats, and integrative memory would be expected as a function of heart rate. Furthermore, the PTM-induced slowing of dissociation between beats would greatly promote persistent CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4 activity in the heart. Together, these findings suggest a significant role of PTM-induced changes in CaMKII\u00ce\u00b4 affinity for CaM and memory under physiological and pathophysiological processes in the heart."

METHODS:Adult male patients diagnosed with SCST between 1988 and 2010 were identified within the California Cancer Registry (CCR). Baseline demographic variables and disease characteristics were reported. Primary outcome measures were cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Bivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were employed to identify predictors of survival. RESULTS:A total of 67 patients with SCST were identified, of which 45 (67%) had Leydig cell and 19 (28%) had Sertoli cell tumours. Median age was 40 years and the majority of patients (84%) presented with localized disease. Following orchiectomy, nine patients (15%) underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), whereas 54 patients (80%) had no further treatment. With a median followup of 75 months, two-year OS and CSS was 91% and 95%, respectively, for those presenting with stage I disease. For those presenting with stage II disease, two-year OS and CSS was 30%. Predictors of worse OS included age >60 (hazard ratio [HR] 5.64; p<0.01) and metastatic disease (HR 8.56; p<0.01). Presentation with metastatic disease was the only variable associated with worse CSS (HR 13.36; p<0.01). Histology was not found to be a significant predictor of either CSS or OS. CONCLUSIONS:We present the largest reported series to date for this rare tumour and provide contemporary epidemiological and treatment data. The primary driver of prognosis in patients with SCST is disease stage, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention."

Moreover, there are increasing research interests focusing on utilizing distributed networked computers for parallel computing. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard was designed to support portability and platform independence of a developed parallel program. However, the procedure to start an MPI-based parallel computation among distributed computers lacks autonomicity and flexibility. This article presents an autonomic dynamic parallel computing framework that provides autonomicity and flexibility that are important and necessary to some parallel computing applications involving resource constrained and heterogeneous platforms. In this framework, an MPI parallel computing environment consisting of multiple computing entities is dynamically established through inter-agent communications using the IEEE Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) compliant Agent Communication Language (ACL) messages. For each computing entity in the MPI parallel computing environment, a load-balanced MPI program C source code along with the MPI environment configuration statements are dynamically composed as a mobile agent code. A mobile agent wrapping the mobile agent code is created and sent to the computing entity where the mobile agent code is retrieved and interpretively executed. An example of autonomic parallel matrix multiplication is given to demonstrate the self-configuration and self-optimization properties of the presented framework.

All 41 patients (18 males, 23 females) who responded were examined. Instantaneous exact hazard rates for ossification of the jaw were calculated by the Weibull model. Results. Thirty-six patients had dental procedures performed. Twenty-one (58%) patients had received an injection of local anesthetic. Five (24%) patients had an immediate flare-up of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva with ossification and permanent ankylosis of the jaw (expected occurrence, 0.031; P < 0.0001). None of the 12 patients who had comparable dental work without injections developed heterotopic ossification (expected occurrence, 0.019; not significant). Conclusion. Injections of local anesthetic during dental procedures pose serious and immediate risk for inciting heterotopic ossification and ankylosis of the jaw in patients who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and should be assiduously avoided."

They are also involved in other conditions, including organ rejection, graft-versus-host disease, recurrent spontaneous abortions, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. We demonstrate that human NK cells express the potassium channels Kv1.3 and KCa3.1. Expression of these channels does not vary with expression levels of maturation markers but varies between adherent and non-adherent NK cell subpopulations. Upon activation by mitogens or tumor cells, adherent NK (A-NK) cells preferentially up-regulate KCa3.1 and non-adherent (NA-NK) cells preferentially up-regulate Kv1.3. Consistent with this different phenotype, A-NK and NA-NK do not display the same sensitivity to the selective KCa3.1 blockers TRAM-34 and NS6180 and to the selective Kv1.3 blockers ShK-186 and PAP-1 in functional assays. Kv1.3 block inhibits the proliferation and degranulation of NA-NK cells with minimal effects on A-NK cells. In contrast, blocking KCa3.1 increases the degranulation and cytotoxicity of A-NK cells, but not of NA-NK cells. TRAM-34, however, does not affect their ability to form conjugates with target tumor cells, to migrate, or to express chemokine receptors. TRAM-34 and NS6180 also increase the proliferation of both A-NK and NA-NK cells. This results in a TRAM-34-induced increased ability of A-NK cells to reduce in vivo tumor growth. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting KCa3.1 on NK cells with selective blockers may be beneficial in cancer immunotherapy."

We have developed a general strategy to address this challenge by combining high-level expression of recombinant VGICs in Tetrahymena thermophila with immunization of phylogenetically diverse species and unique screening tools that allow deep-mining for antibodies that could potentially bind functionally important regions of the protein. Using this approach, we targeted human Kv1.3, a voltage-gated potassium channel widely recognized as a therapeutic target for the treatment of a variety of T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. Recombinant Kv1.3 was used to generate and recover 69 full-length anti-Kv1.3&nbsp;mAbs from immunized chickens and llamas, of which 10 were able to inhibit Kv1.3 current. Select antibodies were shown to be potent (IC50<10&nbsp;nM) and specific for Kv1.3 over related Kv1 family members, hERG and hNav1.5."

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor, with fast recurrence even after surgical intervention, radio- and chemotherapies. One of the reasons for relapse is the early invasion of surrounding brain parenchyma by GBM, rendering tumor eradication difficult. Recent studies demonstrate that, in addition to eliminate possible residual tumoral cells after surgery, radiation stimulates the infiltrative behavior of GBM cells. The intermediate conductance of Ca2+-activated potassium channels (KCa3.1) play an important role in regulating the migration of GBM. Here, we show that high dose radiation of patient-derived GBM cells increases their invasion, and induces the transcription of key genes related to these functions, including the IL-4/IL-4R pair. In addition, we demonstrate that radiation increases the expression of KCa3.1 channels, and that their pharmacological inhibition counteracts the pro-invasive phenotype induced by radiation in tumor cells. Our data describe a possible approach to treat tumor resistance that follows radiation therapy in GBM patients."

Here, we explored the consequences of genetically encoded induction of the cell volume-regulating Ca2+-activated KCa3.1 channel (Kcnn4) for murine epidermal homeostasis. Doxycycline-treated mice harboring the KCa3.1+-transgene under the control of the reverse tetracycline-sensitive transactivator (rtTA) showed 800-fold channel overexpression above basal levels in the skin and solid KCa3.1-currents in keratinocytes. This overexpression resulted in epidermal spongiosis, progressive epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, itch and ulcers. The condition was accompanied by production of the pro-proliferative and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-\u00ce\u00b21 (60-fold), IL-6 (33-fold), and TNF\u00ce\u00b1 (26-fold) in the skin. Treatment of mice with the KCa3.1-selective blocker, Senicapoc, significantly suppressed spongiosis and hyperplasia, as well as induction of IL-\u00ce\u00b21 (-88%) and IL-6 (-90%). In conclusion, KCa3.1-induction in the epidermis caused expression of pro-proliferative cytokines leading to spongiosis, hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. This skin condition resembles pathological features of eczematous dermatitis and identifies KCa3.1 as a regulator of epidermal homeostasis and spongiosis, and as a potential therapeutic target."

        "abstract": "The psychedelic alkaloid ibogaine has anti-addictive properties in both humans and animals1. Unlike most medications for the treatment of substance use disorders, anecdotal reports suggest that ibogaine has the potential to treat addiction to various substances, including opiates, alcohol and psychostimulants. The effects of ibogaine-like those of other psychedelic compounds-are long-lasting2, which has been attributed to its ability to modify addiction-related neural circuitry through the activation of neurotrophic factor signalling3,4. However, several safety concerns have hindered the clinical development of ibogaine, including its toxicity, hallucinogenic potential and tendency to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Here we apply the principles of function-oriented synthesis to identify the key structural elements of the potential therapeutic pharmacophore of ibogaine, and we use this information to engineer tabernanthalog-a water-soluble, non-hallucinogenic, non-toxic analogue of ibogaine that can be prepared in a single step. In rodents, tabernanthalog was found to promote structural neural plasticity, reduce alcohol- and heroin-seeking behaviour, and produce antidepressant-like effects. This work demonstrates that, through careful chemical design, it is possible to modify a psychedelic compound to produce a safer, non-hallucinogenic variant that has therapeutic potential."

Computational approaches combined with vast on-demand chemical libraries can access far greater chemical space, provided that the predictive accuracy is sufficient to identify useful molecules. Through the largest and most diverse virtual HTS campaign reported to date, comprising 318 individual projects, we demonstrate that our AtomNet\u00c2\u00ae convolutional neural network successfully finds novel hits across every major therapeutic area and protein class. We address historical limitations of computational screening by demonstrating success for target proteins without known binders, high-quality X-ray crystal structures, or manual cherry-picking of compounds. We show that the molecules selected by the AtomNet\u00c2\u00ae model are novel drug-like scaffolds rather than minor modifications to known bioactive compounds. Our empirical results suggest that computational methods can substantially replace HTS as the first step of small-molecule drug discovery."

It is well established that microbial colonization is required for normal development of the immune system and that specific microbial constituents prompt the differentiation or expansion of certain immune cell subsets. Nonetheless, it has been unclear how profoundly diet might shape the primate immune system or how durable the influence might be. We show that breast-fed and bottle-fed infant rhesus macaques develop markedly different immune systems, which remain different 6 months after weaning when the animals begin receiving identical diets. In particular, breast-fed infants develop robust populations of memory T cells as well as T helper 17 (TH17) cells within the memory pool, whereas bottle-fed infants do not. These findings may partly explain the variation in human susceptibility to conditions with an immune basis, as well as the variable protection against certain infectious diseases."

        "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) and bile acids share common roles in regulating lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In addition, the receptor for RA (retinoid x receptor) is a permissive partner of the receptor for bile acids, farnesoid x receptor (FXR/NR1H4). Thus, RA can activate the FXR-mediated pathway as well. The current study was designed to understand the effect of all-trans RA on bile acid homeostasis. Mice were fed an all-trans RA-supplemented diet and the expression of 46 genes that participate in regulating bile acid homeostasis was studied. The data showed that all-trans RA has a profound effect in regulating genes involved in synthesis and transport of bile acids. All-trans RA treatment reduced the gene expression levels of Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, and Akr1d1, which are involved in bile acid synthesis. All-trans RA also decreased the hepatic mRNA levels of Lrh-1 (Nr5a2) and Hnf4\u00ce\u00b1 (Nr2a1), which positively regulate the gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1. Moreover, all-trans RA induced the gene expression levels of negative regulators of bile acid synthesis including hepatic Fgfr4, Fxr, and Shp (Nr0b2) as well as ileal Fgf15. All-trans RA also decreased the expression of Abcb11 and Slc51b, which have a role in bile acid transport. Consistently, all-trans RA reduced hepatic bile acid levels and the ratio of CA/CDCA, as demonstrated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data suggest that all-trans RA-induced SHP may contribute to the inhibition of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, which in turn reduces bile acid synthesis and affects lipid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Metabolism supports cell proliferation and growth. Surprisingly, the tumor suppressor miR-22 is induced by metabolic stimulators like bile acids. Thus, this study examines whether miR-22 could be a metabolic silencer. METHODS: The relationship between miR-22 and the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and its receptor FGFR1 was studied in cells and fatty livers obtained from patients and mouse models. We evaluated the effect of an miR-22 inhibitor alone and in combination with obeticholic acid (OCA) for the treatment of steatosis. RESULTS: The levels of miR-22 were inversely correlated with those of FGF21, FGFR1, and PGC1\u00ce\u00b1 in human and mouse fatty livers, suggesting that hepatic miR-22 acts as a metabolic silencer. Indeed, miR-22 reduced FGFR1 by direct targeting and decreased FGF21 by reducing the recruitment of PPAR\u00ce\u00b1 and PGC1\u00ce\u00b1 to their binding motifs. In contrast, an miR-22 inhibitor increases hepatic FGF21 and FGFR1, leading to AMPK and ERK1/2 activation, which was effective in treating alcoholic steatosis in mouse models. The farnesoid x receptor-agonist OCA induced FGF21 and FGFR1, as well as their inhibitor miR-22. An miR-22 inhibitor and OCA were effective in treating diet-induced steatosis, both alone and in combination. The combined treatment was the most effective at improving insulin sensitivity, releasing glucagon-like peptide 1, and reducing hepatic triglyceride in obese mice. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous induction of miR-22, FGF21 and FGFR1 by metabolic stimulators may maintain FGF21 homeostasis and restrict ERK1/2 activation. Reducing miR-22 enhances hepatic FGF21 and activates AMPK, which could be a novel approach to treat steatosis and insulin resistance. LAY SUMMARY: This study examines the metabolic role of a tumor suppressor, miR-22, that can be induced by metabolic stimulators such as bile acids. Our novel data revealed that the metabolic silencing effect of miR-22 occurs as a result of reductions in metabolic stimulators, which likely contribute to the development of fatty liver. Consistent with this finding, an miR-22 inhibitor effectively reversed both alcohol- and diet-induced fatty liver; miR-22 inhibition is a promising therapeutic option which could be used in combination with obeticholic acid."

Bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO) mice develop metabolic liver diseases that progress into cancer as they age, which is accelerated by Western diet (WD) intake. The current study uncovers the molecular signatures for diet and age-linked metabolic liver disease development in an FXR-dependent manner.MethodsWild-type (WT) and FXR KO male mice, either on a healthy control diet (CD) or a WD, were euthanized at the ages of 5, 10, or 15\u00e2\u20ac\u2030months. Hepatic transcriptomics, liver, serum, and urine metabolomics as well as microbiota were profiled.ResultsWD intake facilitated hepatic aging in WT mice. In an FXR-dependent manner, increased inflammation and reduced oxidative phosphorylation were the primary pathways affected by WD and aging. FXR has a role in modulating inflammation and B cell-mediated humoral immunity which was enhanced by aging. Moreover, FXR dictated neuron differentiation, muscle contraction, and cytoskeleton organization in addition to metabolism. There were 654 transcripts commonly altered by diets, ages, and FXR KO, and 76 of them were differentially expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy livers. Urine metabolites differentiated dietary effects in both genotypes, and serum metabolites clearly separated ages irrespective of diets. Aging and FXR KO commonly affected amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle. Moreover, FXR is essential for colonization of age-related gut microbes. Integrated analyses uncovered metabolites and bacteria linked with hepatic transcripts affected by WD intake, aging, and FXR KO as well as related to HCC patient survival.ConclusionFXR is a&nbsp;target to prevent diet or age-associated metabolic disease.

Our objective was to determine whether a routine painful husbandry procedure, hot-iron disbudding, affects how calves trade off risk avoidance against a competing motivation (i.e., feeding), and whether this response depends on time since injury. We used a startle test to evaluate this trade-off in calves disbudded 0 or 21&nbsp;days previously and non-injured control calves. For 3&nbsp;days, calves were individually habituated to the testing arena in which they received a 0.5 L milk meal via a rubber teat. On the 4th day, upon approaching the milk reward, the calf was startled by a sudden noise. We assessed the duration and magnitude of the calf's startle response, their latency to return to the milk bottle, and duration spent suckling after startling. No treatment differences were observed in the duration and magnitude of the startle response or in the probability of returning to the bottle after startling. However, among those who did return, disbudded calves spent longer suckling, indicating they accepted more risk in order to feed compared to controls. In addition, calves with 21-day-old injuries tended to return to the bottle faster compared to newly disbudded calves and controls. We suggest that hot-iron disbudding increases calves' motivation to suckle, as they were more likely to prioritize this behaviour over risk avoidance compared to control calves. This effect was most evident 21&nbsp;days after disbudding, indicating that injury can produce long-term changes in motivational state."

A high-throughput immunoassay would allow for monitoring of human and environmental exposures as a part of risk assessment. Naturally occurring antibodies in camelids that are devoid of light chain, show great promise as an efficient tool in monitoring environmental contaminants, but they have been rarely used for small molecules. An alpaca was immunized with a TBBPA hapten coupled to thyroglobulin and a variable domain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) T3-15 highly selective for TBBPA was isolated from a phage displayed VHH library using heterologous coating antigens. Compared to the VHHs isolated using homologous antigens, VHH T3-15 had about a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity in an immunoassay. This assay, under the optimized conditions of 10% methanol in the assay buffer (pH 7.4), had an IC50 for TBBPA of 0.40 ng mL(-1) and negligible cross reactivity (<0.1%) with other tested analogues. After heating the VHH at 90 \u00c2\u00b0C for 90 min about 20% of the affinity for coating antigen T3-BSA remained. The recoveries of TBBPA from spiked soil and fetal bovine serum samples ranged from 90.3% to 110.7% by ELISA and agreed well with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. We conclude the many advantages of VHH make them attractive for the development of immunoassays to small molecules."

Full-sized equids had a lower risk of nonsurvival as compared to smaller patients (odds ratio = 0.02; 95% confidence intervals = 0.00-0.27; P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.005). Animals with lower body temperatures had increased risk for nonsurvival (P = .0004). Increased admission blood lactate concentrations (P = .003) and decreased serum total protein concentrations (P = .006) were associated with nonsurvival.ConclusionsThe mortality rate in equids attacked by dogs was similar to what is reported for other veterinary species. Smaller equids and those with increased admission blood lactate concentration, lower body temperature, and lower total serum protein concentrations were less likely to survive."

        "abstract": "BackgroundWe reported previously on the emergence and clinical implications of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251) mutants with a K65R mutation in reverse transcriptase (RT), and the role of CD8+ cell-mediated immune responses in suppressing viremia during tenofovir therapy. Because of significant sequence differences between SIV and HIV-1 RT that affect drug susceptibilities and mutational patterns, it is unclear to what extent findings with SIV can be extrapolated to HIV-1 RT. Accordingly, to model HIV-1 RT responses, 12 macaques were inoculated with RT-SHIV, a chimeric SIV containing HIV-1 RT, and started on prolonged tenofovir therapy 5 months later.ResultsThe early virologic response to tenofovir correlated with baseline viral RNA levels and expression of the MHC class I allele Mamu-A*01. For all animals, sensitive real-time PCR assays detected the transient emergence of K70E RT mutants within 4 weeks of therapy, which were then replaced by K65R mutants within 12 weeks of therapy. For most animals, the occurrence of these mutations preceded a partial rebound of plasma viremia to levels that remained on average 10-fold below baseline values. One animal eventually suppressed K65R viremia to undetectable levels for more than 4 years; sequential experiments using CD8+ cell depletion and tenofovir interruption demonstrated that both CD8+ cells and continued tenofovir therapy were required for sustained suppression of viremia.ConclusionThis is the first evidence that tenofovir therapy can select directly for K70E viral mutants in vivo. The observations on the clinical implications of the K65R RT-SHIV mutants were consistent with those of SIVmac251, and suggest that for persons infected with K65R HIV-1 both immune-mediated and drug-dependent antiviral activities play a role in controlling viremia. These findings suggest also that even in the presence of K65R virus, continuation of tenofovir treatment as part of HAART may be beneficial, particularly when assisted by antiviral immune responses."

BTBR T (+) Itpr3 (tf) /J (BTBR), an inbred mouse strain, displays social deficits and repetitive self-grooming, offering face validity to ASD diagnostic symptoms. Reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in BTBR suggests that GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) could improve ASD-relevant BTBR phenotypes. The neuroactive steroid ganaxolone acts as a PAM, displaying anticonvulsant properties in rodent epilepsy models and an anxiolytic-like profile in the elevated plus-maze.ObjectivesWe evaluated ganaxolone in BTBR and C57BL/6J mice in standardized assays for sociability and repetitive behaviors. Open field and anxiety-related behaviors were tested as internal controls and for comparison with the existing neuroactive steroid literature.ResultsGanaxolone improved aspects of social approach and reciprocal social interactions in BTBR, with no effect on repetitive self-grooming, and no detrimental effects in C57BL/6J. Ganaxolone increased overall exploratory activity in BTBR and C57BL/6J in the open field, social approach, and elevated plus-maze, introducing a confound for the interpretation of social improvements. Allopregnanolone and diazepam similarly increased total entries in the elevated plus-maze, indicating that behavioral activation may be a general property of GABAA receptor PAMs in these strains.ConclusionsGanaxolone shows promise for improving sociability. In addition, ganaxolone, as well as other GABAA receptor PAMs, enhanced overall BTBR activity. The translational implications of specific sociability improvements and nonspecific behavioral activation by ganaxolone in the BTBR model remain to be determined. Future studies to explore whether PAMs provide a novel profile with unique benefits for ASD treatment will be worthwhile."

Adults experiencing\u00e2\u20ac\u20304 or more monthly FOSs while receiving stable treatment (1-3 ASMs) were enrolled at 97 sites in North America and Europe.InterventionsPatients were randomized 2:1:1:2 to receive XEN1101, 25, 20, or 10 mg, or placebo with food once daily for 8 weeks. Dosage titration was not used. On completion of the double-blind phase, patients were offered the option of entering an open-label extension (OLE). Patients not participating in the OLE had follow-up safety visits (1 and 6 weeks after the final dose).Main outcomes and measuresThe primary efficacy end point was the median percent change from baseline in monthly FOS frequency. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded and comprehensive laboratory assessments were made. Modified intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.ResultsA total of 325 patients who were randomized and treated were included in the safety analysis; 285 completed the 8-week double-blind phase. In the 325 patients included, mean (SD) age was 40.8 (13.3) years, 168 (51.7%) were female, and 298 (91.7%) identified their race as White. Treatment with XEN1101 was associated with seizure reduction in a robust dose-response manner. The median (IQR) percent reduction from baseline in monthly FOS frequency was 52.8% (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.001 vs placebo; IQR, -80.4% to -16.9%) for 25 mg, 46.4% (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.001 vs placebo; IQR, -76.7% to -14.0%) for 20 mg, and 33.2% (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.04 vs placebo; IQR, \u00e2\u20ac\u2030-61.8% to 0.0%) for 10 mg, compared with 18.2% (IQR, -37.3% to 7.0%) for placebo. XEN1101 was generally well tolerated and TEAEs were similar to those of commonly prescribed ASMs, and no TEAEs leading to death were reported.Conclusions and relevanceThe efficacy and safety findings of this clinical trial support the further clinical development of XEN1101 for the treatment of FOSs.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03796962."

        "abstract": "Bivalent histone modifications are defined as repressive and activating epigenetic marks that simultaneously decorate the same genomic region. The H3K27me3 mark silences gene expression, while the H3K4me3 mark prevents the region from becoming permanently silenced and prepares the domain for activation when needed. Specific regions of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latent episomes are poised to be activated by the KSHV replication and transcription activator (K-Rta). How KSHV episomes are prepared such that they maintain latent infection and switch to lytic replication by K-Rta remains unclear. K-Rta transactivation activity requires a protein degradation function; thus, we hypothesized that identification of cellular substrates of K-Rta may provide insight into the maintenance of KSHV latent infection and the switch to lytic replication. Here we show that a zinc finger protein, ZIC2, a key regulator for central nervous system development, is a substrate of K-Rta and is responsible for maintaining latency. K-Rta directly interacted with ZIC2 and functioned as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate ZIC2. ZIC2 localized at immediate early and early gene cluster regions of the KSHV genome and contributed to tethering of polycomb repressive complex 2 through physical interaction, thus maintaining H3K27me3 marks at the K-Rta promoter. Accordingly, depletion of ZIC2 shifted the balance of bivalent histone modifications toward more active forms and induced KSHV reactivation in naturally infected cells. We suggest that ZIC2 turnover by K-Rta is a strategy employed by KSHV to favor the transition from latency to lytic replication.IMPORTANCE Posttranslational histone modifications regulate the accessibility of transcriptional factors to DNA; thus, they have profound effects on gene expression (e.g., viral reactivation). KSHV episomes are known to possess bivalent chromatin domains. How such KSHV chromatin domains are maintained to be reactivatable by K-Rta remains unclear. We found that ZIC2, a transcriptional factor essential for stem cell pluripotency, plays a role in maintaining KSHV latent infection in naturally infected cells. We found that ZIC2 degradation by K-Rta shifts bivalent histone marks to a more active configuration, leading to KSHV reactivation. ZIC2 interacts with and maintains polycomb repressor complex 2 at the K-Rta promoter. Our findings uncover (i) a mechanism utilized by KSHV to maintain latent infection, (ii) a latency-lytic cycle switch operated by K-Rta, and (iii) a molecular mechanism of ZIC2-mediated local histone modification."

        "abstract": "Despite the potential of rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA) to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic interventions for a range of psychiatric disorders, current approaches using these models ignore two of the most important aspects of this risk factor for human disease: (i) most pregnancies are resilient to maternal viral infection and (ii) susceptible pregnancies can lead to different combinations of phenotypes in offspring. Here, we report two new sources of variability-the baseline immunoreactivity (BIR) of isogenic females prior to pregnancy and differences in immune responses in C57BL/6 dams across vendors-that contribute to resilience and susceptibility to distinct combinations of behavioral and biological outcomes in offspring. Similar to the variable effects of human maternal infection, MIA in mice does not cause disease-related phenotypes in all pregnancies and a combination of poly(I:C) dose and BIR predicts susceptibility and resilience of pregnancies to aberrant repetitive behaviors and alterations in striatal protein levels in offspring. Even more surprising is that the intermediate levels of BIR and poly(I:C) dose are most detrimental to offspring, with higher BIR and poly(I:C) doses conferring resilience to measured phenotypes in offspring. Importantly, we identify the BIR of female mice as a biomarker before pregnancy that predicts which dams will be most at risk as well as biomarkers in the brains of newborn offspring that correlate with changes in repetitive behaviors. Together, our results highlight considerations for optimizing MIA protocols to enhance rigor and reproducibility and reveal new factors that drive susceptibility of some pregnancies and resilience of others to MIA-induced abnormalities in offspring."

MIA-induced acute upregulation of genes associated with hypoxia, immune signaling, and angiogenesis, by 6 hr following exposure. This acute response was followed by changes in proliferation, neuronal and glial specification, and cortical lamination that emerged at E14.5 and peaked at E17.5.

We tested two interventions, calorie restriction and pravastatin administration, during pregnancy in a rhesus macaque model with the hypothesis that these interventions would normalize metabolic dysregulation in pregnant mothers leading to an improvement in infant metabolic and cognitive/social development.MethodsA total of 19 obese mothers were assigned to either one of the two intervention groups (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20305 for calorie restriction; n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20307 for pravastatin) or an obese control group (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20307) with no intervention, and maternal gestational samples and postnatal infant samples were compared with lean control mothers (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20306) using metabolomics methods.ResultsGestational calorie restriction normalized one-carbon metabolism dysregulation in obese mothers, but altered energy metabolism in her offspring. Although administration of pravastatin during pregnancy tended to normalize blood cholesterol in the mothers, it potentially impacted the gut microbiome and kidney function of their offspring. In the offspring, both calorie restriction and pravastatin administration during pregnancy tended to normalize the activity of AMPK in the brain at 6 months, and while results of the Visual Paired-Comparison test, which measures infant recognition memory, was not significantly impacted by either of the interventions, gestational pravastatin administration, but not calorie restriction, tended to normalize anxiety assessed by the Human Intruder test.ConclusionsAlthough the two interventions tested in a non-human primate model led to some improvements in metabolism and/or infant brain development, negative impacts were also found in both mothers and infants. Our study emphasizes the importance of assessing gestational interventions for maternal obesity on both maternal and offspring long-term outcomes."

        "abstract": "Maternal infection has emerged as an important environmental risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Animal model systems of maternal immune activation (MIA) suggest that the maternal immune response plays a significant role in the offspring's neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes. Extracellular free water is a measure of freely diffusing water in the brain that may be associated with neuroinflammation and impacted by MIA. The present study evaluates the brain diffusion characteristics of male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) born to MIA-exposed dams (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203014) treated with a modified form of the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid at the end of the first trimester. Control dams received saline injections at the end of the first trimester (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203010) or were untreated (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20304). Offspring underwent diffusion MRI scans at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 45 months. Offspring born to MIA-exposed dams showed significantly increased extracellular free water in cingulate cortex gray matter starting as early as 6 months of age and persisting through 45 months. In addition, offspring gray matter free water in this region was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the maternal IL-6 response in the MIA-exposed dams. Significant correlations between brain volume and extracellular free water in the MIA-exposed offspring also indicate converging, multimodal evidence of the impact of MIA on brain development. These findings provide strong evidence for the construct validity of the nonhuman primate MIA model as a system of relevance for investigating the pathophysiology of human neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. Elevated free water in individuals exposed to immune activation in utero could represent an early marker of a perturbed or vulnerable neurodevelopmental trajectory."

Alternative inclusion of MECP2/Mecp2 exon 1 with exons 3 and 4 encodes MeCP2-e1 or MeCP2-e2 protein isoforms with unique amino termini. While most MECP2 mutations are located in exons 3 and 4 thus affecting both isoforms, MECP2 exon 1 mutations but not exon 2 mutations have been identified in RTT patients, suggesting that MeCP2-e1 deficiency is sufficient to cause RTT. As expected, genetic deletion of Mecp2 exons 3 and/or 4 recapitulates RTT-like neurologic defects in mice. However, Mecp2 exon 2 knockout mice have normal neurologic function. Here, a naturally occurring MECP2 exon 1 mutation is recapitulated in a mouse model by genetic engineering. A point mutation in the translational start codon of Mecp2 exon 1, transmitted through the germline, ablates MeCP2-e1 translation while preserving MeCP2-e2 production in mouse brain. The resulting MeCP2-e1 deficient mice developed forelimb stereotypy, hindlimb clasping, excessive grooming and hypo-activity prior to death between 7 and 31 weeks. MeCP2-e1 deficient mice also exhibited abnormal anxiety, sociability and ambulation. Despite MeCP2-e1 and MeCP2-e2 sharing, 96% amino acid identity, differences were identified. A fraction of phosphorylated MeCP2-e1 differed from the bulk of MeCP2 in subnuclear localization and co-factor interaction. Furthermore, MeCP2-e1 exhibited enhanced stability compared with MeCP2-e2 in neurons.

The molecular mechanisms involve the overexpression of genes related to DNA methylation on chromosome 21. Here, we stably overexpressed the chromosome 21 gene DNA methyltransferase 3L (DNMT3L) in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and assayed DNA methylation at over 26 million CpGs by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) at three different developmental phases (undifferentiated, differentiating, and differentiated).ResultsDNMT3L overexpression resulted in global CpG and CpG island hypermethylation as well as thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The DNMT3L DMRs were skewed towards hypermethylation and mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, cellular signaling, and gene regulation. Consensus DNMT3L DMRs showed that cell lines clustered by genotype and then differentiation phase, demonstrating sets of common genes affected across neuronal differentiation. The hypermethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons were enriched for regions of bivalent chromatin marked by H3K4me3 as well as differentially methylated sites from previous DS studies of diverse tissues. In contrast, the hypomethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons displayed a tissue-specific profile enriched for regions of heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 during embryonic development.ConclusionsTaken together, these results support a mechanism whereby regions of bivalent chromatin that lose H3K4me3 during neuronal differentiation are targeted by excess DNMT3L and become hypermethylated. Overall, these findings demonstrate that DNMT3L overexpression during neurodevelopment recreates a facet of the genome-wide DS DNA methylation signature by targeting known genes and gene clusters that display pan-tissue differential methylation in DS."

Finally, cancer cells were pharmacologically inhibited for MARCKS activity and subjected to functional bioassays.We demonstrated that higher phospho-MARCKS levels were correlated with shorter overall survival of lung cancer patients. Using shRNA silencing and ectopic expression of wild-type and PSD-mutated (S159/163A) MARCKS, we showed that elevated phospho-MARCKS promoted cancer growth and erlotinib resistance. Further studies demonstrated an interaction of phosphoinositide 3-kinase with MARCKS, but not with phospho-MARCKS. Interestingly, phospho-MARCKS acted in parallel with increased phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate pools and AKT activation in cells. Through treatment with a 25-mer peptide targeting the MARCKS PSD motif (MPS peptide), we were able to suppress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, and reduced levels of phospho-MARCKS, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, and AKT activity. This peptide also enhanced the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to erlotinib treatment, especially those with sustained activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling.These results suggest a key role for MARCKS PSD in cancer disease and provide a unique strategy for inhibiting the activity of MARCKS PSD as a treatment for lung cancer."

        "abstract": "Cigarette smoke has been shown to trigger aberrant signaling pathways and pathophysiological processes; however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying smoke-induced gene expression remain to be established. Herein, we observed that two smoke-responsive genes, HO-1 and CYP1A1, are robustly induced upon smoke by different mechanisms in human bronchial epithelia. CYP1A1 is mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, while induction of HO-1 is regulated by oxidative stress, and suppressed by N-acetylcysteine treatment. In light of a pivotal role of NRF2 and BACH1 in response to oxidative stress and regulation of HO-1, we examined if smoke-induced HO-1 expression is modulated through the NRF2/BACH1 axis. We demonstrated that smoke causes significant nuclear translocation of NRF2, but only a slight decrease in nuclear BACH1. Knockdown of NRF2 attenuated smoke-induced HO-1 expression while down-regulation of BACH1 had stimulatory effects on both basal and smoke-induced HO-1 with trivial influence on NRF2 nuclear translocation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that smoke augments promoter-specific DNA binding of NRF2 but suppresses BACH1 binding to the HO-1 promoter ARE sites, two of which at -1.0 kb and -2.6 kb are newly identified. These results suggest that the regulation of NRF2 activator and BACH1 repressor binding to the ARE sites are critical for smoke-mediated HO-1 induction."

        "abstract": "Mus81-Mms4/EME1 is a DNA structure-selective endonuclease that cleaves joint DNA molecules that form during homologous recombination in mitotic and meiotic cells. Here, we demonstrate by kinetic analysis using physically tethered DNA substrates that budding yeast Mus81-Mms4 requires inherent rotational flexibility in DNA junctions for optimal catalysis. F\u00c3\u00b6rster Resonance Energy Transfer experiments further reveal that recognition of 3'-flap and nicked Holliday junction substrates by Mus81-Mms4 involves induction of a sharp bend with a 100\u00c2\u00b0 angle between two duplex DNA arms. In addition, thiol crosslinking of Mus81-Mms4 bound to DNA junctions demonstrates that the heterodimer undergoes a conformational change induced by joint DNA molecules with preferred structural properties. The results from all three approaches suggest a model for catalysis by Mus81-Mms4 in which initial DNA binding is based on minimal structural requirements followed by a rate-limiting conformational transition of the substrate and protein. This leads to a sharply kinked DNA molecule that may fray the DNA four base pairs away from the junction point to position the nuclease for cleavage between the fourth and fifth nucleotide. These data suggest that mutually compatible conformational changes of Mus81-Mms4 and its substrates tailor its incision activity to nicked junction molecules."

        "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA damage response (DDR) is activated by the spatio-temporal colocalization of Mec1-Ddc2 kinase and the 9-1-1 clamp. In the absence of direct means to monitor Mec1 kinase activation in vivo, activation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53 has been taken as a proxy for DDR activation. Here, we identify serine 378 of the Rad55 recombination protein as a direct target site of Mec1. Rad55-S378 phosphorylation leads to an electrophoretic mobility shift of the protein and acts as a sentinel for Mec1 activation in vivo. A single double-stranded break (DSB) in G1-arrested cells causes phosphorylation of Rad55-S378, indicating activation of Mec1 kinase. However, Rad53 kinase is not detectably activated under these conditions. This response required Mec1-Ddc2 and loading of the 9-1-1 clamp by Rad24-RFC, but not Rad9 or Mrc1. In addition to Rad55-S378, two additional direct Mec1 kinase targets are phosphorylated, the middle subunit of the ssDNA-binding protein RPA, RPA2 and histone H2A (H2AX). These data suggest the existence of a truncated signaling pathway in response to a single DSB in G1-arrested cells that activates Mec1 without eliciting a full DDR involving the entire signaling pathway including the effector kinases."

        "abstract": "Inaccurate repair of broken chromosomes generates structural variants that can fuel evolution and inflict pathology. We describe a novel rearrangement mechanism in which translocation between intact chromosomes is induced by a lesion on a third chromosome. This multi-invasion-induced rearrangement (MIR) stems from a homologous recombination byproduct, where a broken DNA end simultaneously invades two intact donors. No homology is required between the donors, and the intervening sequence from the invading molecule is inserted at the translocation site. MIR is stimulated by increasing homology length and spatial proximity of the donors and depends on the overlapping activities of the structure-selective endonucleases Mus81-Mms4, Slx1-Slx4, and Yen1. Conversely, the 3'-flap nuclease Rad1-Rad10 and enzymes known to disrupt recombination intermediates (Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1, Srs2, and Mph1) inhibit MIR. Resolution of MIR intermediates propagates secondary chromosome breaks that frequently cause additional rearrangements. MIR features have implications for the formation of simple and complex rearrangements underlying human pathologies."

Numerous factors regulate D-loop formation and disruption, thereby influencing crucial aspects of DNA repair, including donor choice and the possibility of crossover outcome. While D-loop detection methods exist, it is currently unfeasible to assess the relationship between D-loop editors and D-loop characteristics such as length and position. Here, we developed a novel in vitro assay to characterize the length and position of individual D-loops with near base-pair resolution and deep coverage, while also revealing their distribution in a population. Non-denaturing bisulfite treatment modifies the cytosines on the displaced strand of the D-loop to uracil, leaving a permanent signature for the displaced strand. Subsequent single-molecule real-time sequencing uncovers the cytosine conversion patch as a D-loop footprint. The D-loop Mapping Assay is widely applicable with different substrates and donor types and can be used to study factors that influence D-loop properties."

Thus, the p53-RNPC1 loop is critical for modulating p53 tumor suppression, but it is not clear how the loop is regulated. Here, we showed that RNPC1 is phosphorylated at Ser195 by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). We also showed that GSK3 promotes p53 mRNA translation through phosphorylation of RNPC1. Interestingly, we found that the phosphor-mimetic mutant S195D and the deletion mutant \u00ce\u201d189-204, which lacks the GSK3 phosphorylation site, are unable to repress p53 mRNA translation due to loss of interaction with eukaryotic translation factor eIF4E on p53 mRNA. Additionally, we found that phosphorylated RNPC1, RNPC1-S195D, and RNPC1(\u00ce\u201d189-204) promote p53 mRNA translation through interaction with eukaryotic translation factor eIF4G, which then facilitates the assembly of the eIF4F complex on p53 mRNA. Furthermore, we showed that upon inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, GSK3 is activated, leading to increased RNPC1 phosphorylation and increased p53 expression in a RNPC1-dependent manner. Together, we postulate that the p53-RNPC1 loop can be explored to increase or decrease p53 activity for cancer therapy."

We identified 1,189 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database with data on site and extent of surgery. We excluded patients diagnosed before 1990, &#60;18 years, or lacking pathologic confirmation. Using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses, we determined predictors of overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Results: The mean age was 41, 49.3% were female, and 82.2% were white. Radiotherapy (RT) was administered to 57.5%. On multivariable analysis, age at diagnosis, sex, race, anatomic site, SEER summary stage, tumor size, surgery type, and RT predicted OS. Similar predictors of DSS were identified. The hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.65 (95% CI 0.48-0.88) in favor of RT and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.86) for DSS. Five-year OS improved 8.4\u00c2\u00b11.0% with RT (P=0.003), and five-year DSS improved 7.7\u00c2\u00b11.0% with RT (P=0.015). Conclusions: In the largest study to date examining the role of RT in synovial sarcoma, we observed that RT was associated with a statistically significant improvement in oncologic outcome among SS patients. These data support the use of RT in the multi-modality treatment of patients with SS."

We sought to determine if the expression of CSC markers (aldehyde dehydrogenase [ALDH], CD44, and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) predicted outcomes in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients.MethodsWe queried an institutional database of 23 STS patients and evaluated immunohistochemical expression of CSC markers ALDH, CD44, and EGFR. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was also queried for STS clinical and genomic data. Disease-specific (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by univariate and Kaplan-Meier analysis.ResultsOf the 23 institutional patients, the majority was female, had high-grade tumors and had extremity tumors. With a median follow-up of 27&nbsp;months, nine patients (39%) experienced distant recurrence, and four (17%) died of disease. Mean H-scores at diagnosis (\u00c2\u00b1standard error of the mean) for CD44, ALDH1, and EGFR were 169&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b1&nbsp;27, 77&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b1&nbsp;15, and 144&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b1&nbsp;23, respectively.

On CTs of the abdomen and pelvis, skeletal muscle was segmented, and cross-sectional muscle area, muscle volume, and muscle attenuation were determined. Within the segmented muscle, intramuscular fat area, volume, and density were derived. On PET images, the standardized uptake value (SUV) of muscle was determined. Regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between the imaging measures and health outcomes including overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant cancer recurrence (DCR), and major surgical complications (MSC). The association between imaging metrics and pre-therapy levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, hemoglobin, and albumin was determined. Decreased volumetric muscle CT attenuation was associated with increased DCR. Increased PET SUV of muscle was associated with decreased OS and LRFS. Lower muscle SUV was associated with lower serum hemoglobin and albumin. Muscle measurements obtained on routine 18F-FDG PET/CT are associated with outcomes and serum hemoglobin and albumin in patients with sarcoma."

In this paper, we present spatially resolved spectroscopy and nebular emission kinematic maps for 17 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses 8 < log(M \u00e2\u02c6\u2014/M o) < 9.8 and redshifts 1.2 < z < 2.3. OLAS is designed to probe the stellar mass (M \u00e2\u02c6\u2014) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) range where simulations suggest that stellar feedback is most effective at driving gaseous outflows that create galaxy-wide potential fluctuations, which can generate dark matter cores. We compare our kinematic data with the trend among sSFR, M \u00e2\u02c6\u2014, and H\u00ce\u00b1 velocity dispersion, \u00cf\u0192, from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. Our observations reveal a correlation between sSFR and \u00cf\u0192 at fixed M \u00e2\u02c6\u2014 that is similar to the trend predicted by simulations: feedback from star formation drives star-forming gas and newly formed stars into more dispersion-dominated orbits. The observed magnitude of this effect is in good agreement with the FIRE simulations, in which feedback alters the central density profiles of low-mass galaxies, converting dark matter cusps into cores over time. Our data support the scenario that stellar feedback drives gaseous outflows and potential fluctuations, which in turn drive dark matter core formation in dwarf galaxies."

OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to characterize the transcriptome of HS T17 cells compared to the transcriptome of psoriasis T17 cells, along with their ligand-receptor interactions with neighborhood immune cell subsets. METHODS: Single-cell data of 12,300 cutaneous immune cells from 8 deroofing surgical HS skin samples including dermal tunnels were compared to single-cell data of psoriasis skin (19,525 cells from 11 samples) and control skin (11,920 cells from 10 samples). All single-cell data were generated by the same protocol. RESULTS: HS T17 cells expressed lower levels of IL23R and higher levels of IL1R1 and IL17F compared to psoriasis T17 cells (P&nbsp;< .05). HS Treg cells expressed higher levels of IL1R1 and IL17F compared to psoriasis Treg cells (P&nbsp;< .05). Semimature dendritic cells were the major immune cell subsets expressing IL1B in HS, and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 ligand-receptor interactions between semimature dendritic cells and T17 cells were increased in HS compared to psoriasis (P&nbsp;< .05). HS dermal tunnel keratinocytes expressed inflammatory cytokines (IL17C, IL1A, IL1B, and IL6) that differed from the HS epidermis keratinocytes (IL36G) (P&nbsp;< .05). IL6, which synergizes with IL1B to maintain cytokine expression in T17 cells, was mainly expressed by fibroblasts in HS, which also expressed IL11+ inflammatory fibroblast genes (IL11, IL24, IL6, and POSTN) involved in the paracrine IL-1/IL-6 loop. CONCLUSION: The IL-1\u00ce\u00b2-T17 cell cytokine axis is likely a dominant pathway in HS with HS T17 cells activated by IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 signaling, unlike psoriasis T17 cells, which are activated by IL-23 signaling."

        "abstract": "BackgroundDietary supplements, like small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS), are used in intervention programs to prevent undernutrition among women and young children in low-income countries. An objective marker is needed to track consumption of supplements to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate saccharin and resveratrol as potential adherence markers for tracking recent consumption of a single serving of SQ-LNS in women.MethodsForty-seven healthy nonpregnant women 18-45 y of age were assigned to consume a single dose of SQ-LNS (20&nbsp;g) containing either 10&nbsp;mg sodium saccharin or 5&nbsp;mg trans-resveratrol, under supervision. On the day before and for 2 d following SQ-LNS consumption, urine samples were collected each day for 24 h as 3 consecutive 4-h collections and one 12-h overnight collection. Urinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, a resveratrol metabolite, were measured by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography interfaced to a mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization [UHPLC-(ESI-)MS/MS]. Urinary concentrations (\u00ce\u00bcmol/L urine) of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate were plotted against time, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the discriminative capacity of each compound, at each post-consumption time point compared with baseline, to detect recent consumption of SQ-LNS. Cutoff values to differentiate supplement consumption from nonconsumption of each marker were developed using the closest-to-(0,1)-corner cut-point approach.ResultsForty-five participants were included in the analysis. Urinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate increased within 4 h of SQ-LNS consumption. Urinary concentration cutoff values for saccharin (13.4&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b5mol/L) and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate (0.7&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b5mol/L) allowed for 78% and 89% sensitivity, respectively, and 100% specificity in detecting consumption of SQ-LNS within the first 12&nbsp;h after consumption.ConclusionsUrinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate reflect consumption of SQ-LNS containing those compounds during the first 12&nbsp;h post-consumption with high sensitivity and specificity in healthy women and may be useful objective adherence markers for tracking consumption of SQ-LNS."

        "abstract": "The MAPK phosphatase MKP1 (DUSP1) is overexpressed in many human cancers, including chemoresistant and radioresistant breast cancer cells, but its functional contributions in these settings are unclear. Here, we report that after cell irradiation, MKP1 translocates into mitochondria, where it prevents apoptotic induction by limiting accumulation of phosphorylated active forms of the stress kinase JNK. Increased levels of mitochondrial MKP1 after irradiation occurred in the mitochondrial inner membrane space. Notably, cell survival regulated by mitochondrial MKP1 was responsible for conferring radioresistance in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, due to the fact that MKP1 serves as a major downstream effector in the HER2-activated RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. Clinically, we documented MKP1 expression exclusively in HER2-positive breast tumors, relative to normal adjacent tissue from the same patients. MKP1 overexpression was also detected in irradiated HER2-positive breast cancer stem-like cells (HER2(+)/CD44(+)/CD24(-/low)) isolated from a radioresistant breast cancer cell population after long-term radiation treatment. MKP1 silencing reduced clonogenic survival and enhanced radiosensitivity in these stem-like cells. Combined inhibition of MKP1 and HER2 enhanced cell killing in breast cancer. Together, our findings identify a new mechanism of resistance in breast tumors and reveal MKP1 as a novel therapeutic target for radiosensitization."

The cell&nbsp;line is adapted to standard cell culture and can be transplanted into syngeneic FVB/N mice. The line maintains a stable phenotype over multiple in vitro passages and rounds of in vivo transplantation. NDLUCD tumors in FVB/N mice exhibit high expression of ErbB2 and ErbB3 and signaling molecules downstream of ErbB2. The syngeneic transplant tumors elicit an immune reaction in the adjacent stroma, detected and characterized using histology, immunophenotyping, and gene expression. NDLUCD cells also express PD-L1 in vivo and in vitro, and in vivo transplants are reactive to anti-immune checkpoint therapy with responses conducive to immunotherapy studies. This new NDLUCD cell line model is a practical alternative to the more commonly used 4T1 cells, and our previously described FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul derived Met-1fvb2 and FVB/NTg(MMTV-PyVTY315F/Y322F) derived DB-7fvb2 cell lines.

The downstream signaling system is wired with multiple feedback loops that amplify weak inputs and promote spatial separation of cell front and rear activities 1, 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 . Positive feedback could promote rapid signal spreading 9 , yet information from the receptors is transmitted with high spatial fidelity, enabling detection of small differences in chemoattractant concentration across the cell 1 . How the signal transduction network achieves signal amplification while preserving spatial information remains unclear. The GTPase Cdc42 is a cell-front polarity coordinator that is predictive of cell turning, suggesting an important role in spatial processing 10 . To directly measure information flow from receptors to Cdc42, we paired zebrafish parapinopsina, an optogenetic GPCR that allows reversible ON/OFF receptor control with a spectrally compatible red/far red Cdc42 FRET biosensor. Using this new toolkit, we show that positive and negative signals downstream of G-proteins shape a rapid, dose-dependent Cdc42 response. Furthermore, F-actin and Cdc42 itself provide two distinct negative signals that limit the duration and spatial spread of Cdc42 activation, maintaining output signals local to the originating receptors."

        "abstract": "Recent studies indicate both clinical and mechanistic links between atherosclerotic heart disease and intestinal microbial metabolism of certain dietary nutrients producing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Here we test the hypothesis that gut microbial transplantation can transmit choline diet-induced TMAO production and atherosclerosis susceptibility. First, a strong association was noted between atherosclerotic plaque and plasma TMAO levels in a mouse diversity panel (n = 22 strains, r = 0.38; p = 0.0001). An atherosclerosis-prone and high TMAO-producing strain, C57BL/6J, and an atherosclerosis-resistant and low TMAO-producing strain, NZW/LacJ, were selected as donors for cecal microbial transplantation into apolipoprotein e null mice in which resident intestinal microbes were first suppressed with antibiotics. Trimethylamine (TMA) and TMAO levels were initially higher in recipients on choline diet that received cecal microbes from C57BL/6J inbred mice; however, durability of choline diet-dependent differences in TMA/TMAO levels was not maintained to the end of the study. Mice receiving C57BL/6J cecal microbes demonstrated choline diet-dependent enhancement in atherosclerotic plaque burden as compared with recipients of NZW/LacJ microbes. Microbial DNA analyses in feces and cecum revealed transplantation of donor microbial community features into recipients with differences in taxa proportions between donor strains that were transmissible to recipients and that tended to show coincident proportions with TMAO levels. Proportions of specific taxa were also identified that correlated with plasma TMAO levels in donors and recipients and with atherosclerotic lesion area in recipients. Atherosclerosis susceptibility may be transmitted via transplantation of gut microbiota. Gut microbes may thus represent a novel therapeutic target for modulating atherosclerosis susceptibility."

The regulation of adropin expression was then assessed in silico, in cultured human cells, and in animal models.ResultsIn humans, plasma adropin concentrations are inversely related to atherogenic LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in men (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;349), but not in women (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;401). Analysis of hepatic Enho expression in male mice suggests control by the biological clock. Expression is rhythmic, peaking during maximal food consumption in the dark correlating with transcriptional activation by ROR\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b3. The nadir in the light phase coincides with the rest phase and repression by Rev-erb. Plasma adropin concentrations in nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) also exhibit peaks coinciding with feeding times (07:00&nbsp;h, 15:00&nbsp;h). The ROR inverse agonists SR1001 and the 7-oxygenated sterols 7-\u00ce\u00b2-hydroxysterol and 7-ketocholesterol, or the Rev-erb agonist SR9009, suppress ENHO expression in cultured human HepG2 cells. Consumption of high-cholesterol diets suppress expression of the adropin transcript in mouse liver. However, adropin over expression does not prevent hypercholesterolemia resulting from a high cholesterol diet and/or LDL receptor mutations.ConclusionsIn humans, associations between plasma adropin concentrations and LDL-C suggest a link with hepatic lipid metabolism. Mouse studies suggest that the relationship between adropin and cholesterol metabolism is unidirectional, and predominantly involves suppression of adropin expression by cholesterol and 7-oxygenated sterols. Sensing of fatty acids, cholesterol and oxysterols by the ROR\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b3 ligand-binding domain suggests a plausible functional link between adropin expression and cellular lipid metabolism. Furthermore, the nuclear receptors ROR\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b3 and Rev-erb may couple adropin synthesis with circadian rhythms in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism."

We characterized epoxide hydrolase activities in the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, which suggested multiple forms of epoxide hydrolases were present. We found EH activities on epoxy eicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs and other eicosanoids are well-established lipid signaling molecules in vertebrates. We showed EETs can be synthesized in vitro from arachidonic acids by mosquito lysate, and EETs were also detected in vivo both in larvae and adult mosquitoes by LC-MS/MS. The EH activities on EETs can be induced by blood feeding, and the highest activity was observed in the midgut of female mosquitoes. The enzyme activities on EETs can be inhibited by urea-based inhibitors designed for mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolases (sEH). The sEH inhibitors have been shown to play diverse biological roles in mammalian systems, and they can be useful tools to study the function of EETs in mosquitoes. Besides juvenile hormone metabolism and detoxification, insect epoxide hydrolases may also play a role in regulating lipid signaling molecules, such as EETs and other epoxy fatty acids, synthesized in vivo or obtained from blood feeding by female mosquitoes."

We used this species pair to further analyze the relationship between parentally biased gene expression and postzygotic hybrid incompatibility using two A. thaliana accessions, Col-0 and C24, with differential seed survival. We found that parentally biased expression was perturbed to a similar degree in both A. thaliana hybrids for PHERES1, HDG3, and six other normally paternally expressed genes.

        "abstract": "We present spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity for a system of three galaxies at z = 1.85 detected in the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS). The combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST's) diffraction limit and strong gravitational lensing by the cluster MACS J0717+3745 results in a spatial resolution of \u00e2\u2030\u0192200-300 pc, enabling good spatial sampling despite the intrinsically small galaxy sizes. The galaxies in this system are separated by \u00e2\u2030\u019250-200 kpc in projection and are likely in an early stage of interaction, evidenced by relatively high specific star formation rates. Their gas-phase metallicities are consistent with larger samples at similar redshift, star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass. We obtain a precise measurement of the metallicity gradient for one galaxy and find a shallow slope compared to isolated galaxies at high redshift, consistent with a flattening of the gradient due to gravitational interaction. An alternative explanation for the shallow metallicity gradient and elevated SFR is rapid recycling of metal-enriched gas, but we find no evidence for enhanced gas-phase metallicities which should result from this effect. Notably, the measured stellar masses = 7.2-9.1 probe to an order of magnitude below previous mass-metallicity studies at this redshift. The lowest mass galaxy has properties similar to those expected for Fornax at this redshift, indicating that GLASS is able to directly study the progenitors of local group dwarf galaxies on spatially resolved scales. Larger samples from the full GLASS survey will be ideal for studying the effects of feedback, and the time evolution of metallicity gradients. These initial results demonstrate the utility of HST spectroscopy combined with gravitational lensing for characterizing resolved physical properties of galaxies at high redshift."

We use 85 foreground and background galaxies in the same redshift range as a field sample. The samples are well matched in stellar mass (108-1011 M\u00e2\u0160\u2122) and star formation rate (0.5-50 M\u00e2\u0160\u2122 yr-1). We visually classify galaxies in terms of broad band morphology, H? morphology, and likely physical process acting on the galaxy. Most H? emitters have a spiral morphology (41% \u00c2\u00b1 8% in clusters, 51% \u00c2\u00b1 8% in the field), followed by mergers/interactions (28% \u00c2\u00b1 8%, 31% \u00c2\u00b17%, respectively) and early-type galaxies (remarkably as high as 29% \u00c2\u00b18% in clusters and 15% \u00c2\u00b1 6% in the field). A diversity of H? morphologies is detected, suggesting a diversity of physical processes. In clusters, 30% \u00c2\u00b1 8% of the galaxies present a regular morphology, mostly consistent with star formation diffused uniformly across the stellar population (mostly in the disk component, when present). The second most common morphology (28% \u00c2\u00b18%) is asymmetric/jellyfish, consistent with rampressure stripping or other non-gravitational processes in 18% \u00c2\u00b1 8% of the cases. Ram-pressure stripping appears significantly less prominent in the field (2% \u00c2\u00b1 2%), where the most common morphology/mechanism appears to be consistent with minor gas-rich mergers or clump accretion. This work demonstrates that while environmentspecific mechanisms affect galaxy evolution at this redshift, they are diverse and their effects are subtle. A full understanding of this complexity requires larger samples and detailed and spatially resolved physical models."

        "abstract": "The molecular and neural mechanisms regulating human social-emotional behaviors are fundamentally important but largely unknown; unraveling these requires a genetic systems neuroscience analysis of human models. Williams Syndrome (WS), a condition caused by deletion of ~28 genes, is associated with a gregarious personality, strong drive to approach strangers, difficult peer interactions, and attraction to music. WS provides a unique opportunity to identify endogenous human gene-behavior mechanisms. Social neuropeptides including oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) regulate reproductive and social behaviors in mammals, and we reasoned that these might mediate the features of WS. Here we established blood levels of OT and AVP in WS and controls at baseline, and at multiple timepoints following a positive emotional intervention (music), and a negative physical stressor (cold). We also related these levels to standardized indices of social behavior. Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVP. Further, in WS, OT and AVP increased in response to music and to cold, with greater variability and an amplified peak release compared to controls. In WS, baseline OT but not AVP, was correlated positively with approach, but negatively with adaptive social behaviors. These results indicate that WS deleted genes perturb hypothalamic-pituitary release not only of OT but also of AVP, implicating more complex neuropeptide circuitry for WS features and providing evidence for their roles in endogenous regulation of human social behavior. The data suggest a possible biological basis for amygdalar involvement, for increased anxiety, and for the paradox of increased approach but poor social relationships in WS. They also offer insight for translating genetic and neuroendocrine knowledge into treatments for disorders of social behavior."

        "abstract": "Women exposed to a variety of viral and bacterial infections during pregnancy have an increased risk of giving birth to a child with autism, schizophrenia or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Preclinical maternal immune activation (MIA) models are powerful translational tools to investigate mechanisms underlying epidemiological links between infection during pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopmental disorders. Our previous studies documenting the emergence of aberrant behavior in rhesus monkey offspring born to MIA-treated dams extends the rodent MIA model into a species more closely related to humans. Here we present novel neuroimaging data from these animals to further explore the translational potential of the nonhuman primate MIA model. Nine male MIA-treated offspring and 4 controls from our original cohort underwent in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning at approximately 3.5-years of age using [18F] fluoro-l-m-tyrosine (FMT) to measure presynaptic dopamine levels in the striatum, which are consistently elevated in individuals with schizophrenia. Analysis of [18F]FMT signal in the striatum of these nonhuman primates showed that MIA animals had significantly higher [18F]FMT index of influx compared to control animals. In spite of the modest sample size, this group difference reflects a large effect size (Cohen's d\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.998). Nonhuman primates born to MIA-treated dams exhibited increased striatal dopamine in late adolescence-a hallmark molecular biomarker of schizophrenia. These results validate the MIA model in a species more closely related to humans and open up new avenues for understanding the neurodevelopmental biology of schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders associated with prenatal immune challenge."

It has been studied extensively in chronic schizophrenia (SZ) and the results of these studies have been variable. Comorbidity in chronic samples could be one reason for the mixed findings and studies in first-episode (FE) samples are surprisingly lacking. Bipolar disorder (BP) which shares some genetic and symptom features with SZ could serve as an interesting comparison group for DD but has been underexplored. Here we present the first study that combines FE SZ, FE BP with psychotic features, as well as healthy controls and study DD with two versions of the task. We found that SZ showed steeper discounting than HC and BP on the well-validated Kirby DD task. SZ showed no difference than HC on a separate DD task with smaller rewards presented with decimal places and shorter delays. As a preliminary finding, DD was found to be positively related to positive symptoms in FE SZ, while no relationship was found between negative symptoms and DD. In addition, we found comparable DD in BP compared to HC. Ultimately, our data may help elucidate the psychopathology in SZ and BP during intertemporal decision making."

Because of its extreme stress tolerance and unusual morphology, it is an important donor of germplasm for the cultivated tomato Solanum lycopersicum. Introgression lines (ILs) in which large genomic regions of S. lycopersicum are replaced with the corresponding segments from S. pennellii can show remarkably superior agronomic performance. Here we describe a high-quality genome assembly of the parents of the IL population. By anchoring the S. pennellii genome to the genetic map, we define candidate genes for stress tolerance and provide evidence that transposable elements had a role in the evolution of these traits. Our work paves a path toward further tomato improvement and for deciphering the mechanisms underlying the myriad other agronomic traits that can be improved with S. pennellii germplasm."

Established tomato mapping populations between domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its more distant interfertile relatives typically follow a near isogenic line (NIL) design, such as the S. pennellii Introgression Line (IL) population, with a single wild introgression per line in an otherwise domesticated genetic background. Here, we report on a new advanced backcross QTL mapping resource for tomato, derived from a cross between the M82 tomato cultivar and S. pennellii This so-called Backcrossed Inbred Line (BIL) population is comprised of a mix of BC2 and BC3 lines, with domesticated tomato as the recurrent parent. The BIL population is complementary to the existing S. pennellii IL population, with which it shares parents. Using the BILs, we mapped traits for leaf complexity, leaflet shape, and flowering time. We demonstrate the utility of the BILs for fine-mapping QTL, particularly QTL initially mapped in the ILs, by fine-mapping several QTL to single or few candidate genes. Moreover, we confirm the value of a backcrossed population with multiple introgressions per line, such as the BILs, for epistatic QTL mapping. Our work was further enabled by the development of our own statistical inference and visualization tools, namely a heterogeneous hidden Markov model for genotyping the lines, and by using state-of-the-art sparse regression techniques for QTL mapping."

        "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the role of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium (mitoKATP) channels and protein kinase C (PKC)-\u00ce\u00b5 in the delayed protective effects of sevoflurane preconditioning using Langendorff isolated heart perfusion models. Fifty-four isolated perfused rat hearts were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=9). The rats were exposed for 60 min to 2.5% sevoflurane (the second window of protection group, SWOP group) or 33% oxygen inhalation (I/R group) 24 h before coronary occlusion. The control group (CON) and the sevoflurane group (SEVO) group were exposed to 33% oxygen and 2.5% sevoflurane for 60 min, respectively, without coronary occlusion. The mitoKATP channel inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) was given 30 min before sevoflurane preconditioning (5-HD+SWOP group). Cardiac function indices, infarct sizes, serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations, and the expression levels of phosphorylated PKC-\u00ce\u00b5 (p-PKC-\u00ce\u00b5) and caspase-8 were measured. Cardiac function was unchanged, p-PKC-\u00ce\u00b5 expression was upregulated, caspase-8 expression was downregulated, cTnI concentrations were decreased, and the infarcts were significantly smaller (P<0.05) in the SWOP group compared with the I/R group. Cardiac function was worse, p-PKC-\u00ce\u00b5 expression was downregulated, caspase-8 expression was upregulated, cTnI concentration was increased and infarcts were larger in the 5-HD+SWOP group (P<0.05) compared with the SWOP group. The results suggest that mitoKATP channels are involved in the myocardial protective effects of sevoflurane in preconditioning against I/R injury, by regulating PKC-\u00ce\u00b5 phosphorylation before ischemia, and by downregulating caspase-8 during reperfusion."

        "abstract": "Background and objectiveSevoflurane anaesthetic preconditioning (SPC) has been shown to limit nuclear factor-[kappa]B (NF-[kappa]B) activation and the production of inflammatory cytokines during myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R). Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of NF-[kappa]B using parthenolide is effective in limiting I/R injury. We, therefore, postulated that the protective effect of delayed SPC would be enhanced by pharmacological NF-[kappa]B inhibition during I/R.MethodsHearts from 2-month-old male Fisher 344 rats were exposed to 25 min global ischaemia followed by 60 min reperfusion. Rats were divided into four groups prior to I/R: control group; parthenolide group, treated with the I[kappa]B kinase inhibitor parthenolide intraperitoneally 10 min prior to heart isolation; SPC group, treated for 60 min with sevoflurane 48 h prior to heart isolation; and SPC + parthenolide group, treated with SPC for 1 h followed by parthenolide 48 h later. Infarct area, left ventricular function and Ca2+(i) were measured after I/R.ResultsDelayed SPC + parthenolide resulted in greater protection than either intervention alone, resulting in a significant reduction in infarct area and left ventricular developed pressure (mmHg; 84 +/- 19 compared with 15 +/- 14 in control hearts; P = 0.007). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure also remained close to baseline values (9 +/- 2 mmHg, P = 0.02) during I/R, and the increase in Ca2+(i) seen with I/R was significantly blunted (P = 0.005).ConclusionSPC followed by parthenolide provides a significant protection from I/R injury in this model. As each intervention alone limits NF-[kappa]B activation with I/R, these data are consistent with additive effects of these dual modalities in limiting I/R injury due to NF-[kappa]B activation."

We also strongly recommend the combined use of the VL together with a flexible intubation scope (FIS) for both asleep and awake intubation when dealing with a genuinely difficult airway. Blind intubations should no longer be performed today. When an airway has been recognized as difficult it is the safest to aim for an awake or at least a spontaneously breathing intubation if circumstances do not allow for an awake intubation. Emergency cricothyroidotomy needs to be prepared for so that it can be executed rapidly in case the attempted awake intubation leads to complete airway obstruction."

This study aimed to investigate the transcriptome-wide response of hippocampus in young mice that had been exposed to multiple sevoflurane in the neonatal period. Mice received 3% sevoflurane for 2 h on postnatal day (PND) 6, 8, and 10, followed by arterial blood gas test on PND 10, behavioral experiments on PND 31-36, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of hippocampus on PND 37. Functional annotation and protein-protein interaction analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed. Neonatal sevoflurane exposures induced cognitive and social behavior disorders in young mice. RNA-seq identified a total of 314 DEGs. Several enriched biological processes (ion channels, brain development, learning, and memory) and signaling pathways (oxytocin signaling pathway and glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic synapses) were highlighted. As hub-proteins, Pten was involved in nervous system development, synapse assembly, learning, memory, and behaviors, Nos3 and Pik3cd in oxytocin signaling pathway, and Cdk16 in exocytosis and phosphorylation. Some top DEGs were validated by qPCR. This study revealed a transcriptome-wide profile in mice hippocampus after multiple neonatal exposures to sevoflurane, promoting better understanding of underlying mechanisms and investigation of preventive strategies."

        "abstract": "BackgroundRemote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has the potential to benefit graft function following kidney transplantation by reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury; however, the current clinical evidence is inconclusive. This meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) aimed to determine whether RIC improves graft function after kidney transplantation.MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases until June 20, 2023, to identify all randomized controlled trials that examined the impact of RIC on graft function after kidney transplantation. The primary outcome was the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) post-kidney transplantation. The secondary outcomes included the incidence of acute rejection, graft loss, 3- and 12-month estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), and the length of hospital stay. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on RIC procedures (preconditioning, perconditioning, or postconditioning), implementation sites (upper or lower extremity), and graft source (living or deceased donor).ResultsOur meta-analysis included eight trials involving 1038 patients. Compared with the control, RIC did not significantly reduce the incidence of DGF (8.8% vs. 15.3%; risk ratio\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.76, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.21, P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.25, I2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203016%), and TSA results showed that the required information size was not reached. However, the RIC group had a significantly increased eGFR at 3 months after transplantation (mean difference\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20302.74&nbsp;ml/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI: 1.44-4.05&nbsp;ml/min/1.73 m2, P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.0001, I2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300%), with a sufficient evidence suggested by TSA. The secondary outcomes were comparable between the other secondary outcomes. The treatment effect of RIC did not differ between the subgroup analyses.ConclusionIn this meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis, RIC did not lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of DGF after kidney transplantation. Nonetheless, RIC demonstrated a positive correlation with 3-month eGFR. Given the limited number of patients included in this study, well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes are required to validate the renoprotective benefits of RIC.Trial registrationThis systematic review and meta-analysis was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (Number CRD42023464447)."

The objective of the experiments, which were performed in a towing tank on a representative TLP configuration, was to provide data suitable for validating numerical model predictions. The purpose of the simulations was to determine the extent to which Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), when used as a truly predictive tool, can be relied upon to provide reliable estimates of the total drag force. Thus the simulations were performed only once with no further computations performed in order to bring about closer agreement with the measurements. The dependence of the computed results on the numerical grid was checked using the Grid-Convergence Index (GCI) method applied to results from benchmark flows. These results also served to assess the dependence on the value of the Smagorinsky constant in the model for the sub-grid scale terms. It was found that, at the highest value of Reynolds number considered, the variation between the measured and predicted values of the global drag coefficient was under 10% - a result which is in line with the limitations inherent in both."

        "abstract": "We report on progress made in improving the performance of the well-established wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity model in an important class of multiscale flows, namely, that of unsteady, massively separated flows at high Reynolds number. While this model succeeds in capturing the asymptotic near-wall behavior of the eddy viscosity that enters the formulation of the model for the sub-grid scale correlations, its performance in these flows has proved to be unsatisfactory due to high levels of dissipation leading to poor predictions in the separated wakes. We have sought to improve the performance of this model by combining it with another, the regularized variational multiscale model, which better represents the interactions that occur in multiscale flows. This combination, which was implemented in OpenFOAM, was validated against experimental data for the challenging case of vortex shedding from circular cylinders at the high Reynolds number. Distinct improvements over the original model were obtained."

However, despite advantageous intraoperative utility, limited evidence exists characterizing midterm to long-term clinical outcomes with ISPF. The objective of this multicenter study was to prospectively assess patients receiving single-level anterior (ALIF) or lateral (LLIF) lumbar interbody fusion with adjunctive ISPF.MethodsThis was a prospective, randomized, multicenter (11 investigators), noninferiority trial. All patients received single-level ALIF or LLIF with supplemental ISPF (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203066) or pedicle screw fixation (PSF; n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203037) for degenerative disc disease and/or spondylolisthesis (grade \u00e2\u2030\u00a42). The randomization patient ratio was 2:1, ISPF/PSF. Perioperative and follow-up outcomes were collected (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).ResultsFor ISPF patients, mean posterior intraoperative outcomes were: blood loss, 70.9 mL; operating time, 52.2 minutes; incision length, 5.5 cm; and fluoroscopic imaging time, 10.4 seconds. Statistically significant improvement in patient Oswestry Disability Index scores were achieved by just 6 weeks after operation (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.01) and improved out to 12 months for the ISPF cohort. Patient-reported 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire scores were also significantly improved from baseline to 12 months in the ISPF cohort (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.01). A total of 92.7% of ISPF patients exhibited interspinous fusion at 12 months. One ISPF patient (1.5%) required a secondary surgical intervention of possible relation to the posterior instrumentation/procedure.ConclusionISPF can be achieved quickly, with minimal tissue disruption and complication. In supplementing ALIF and LLIF, ISPF supported significant improvement in early postoperative (\u00e2\u2030\u00a412 months) patient-reported outcomes, while facilitating robust posterior fusion."

Although it is apparent that SHS contributes to endothelial dysfunction, much less is known about how this toxicant alters arterial myocyte contraction, leading to alterations in myogenic tone. The study's goal is to determine the effects of SHS on mesenteric arterial myocyte contractility and excitability. C57BL/6J&nbsp;male mice were randomly assigned to either filtered air (FA) or SHS (6 h/d, 5 d/wk) exposed groups for a 4, 8, or 12-weeks period. Third and fourth-order mesenteric arteries and arterial myocytes were acutely isolated and evaluated with pressure myography and patch clamp electrophysiology, respectively. Myogenic tone was found to be elevated in mesenteric arteries from mice exposed to SHS for 12 wk but not for 4 or 8 wk. These results were correlated with an increase in L-type Ca2+ channel activity in mesenteric arterial myocytes after 12 wk of SHS exposure. Moreover, 12 wk SHS exposed arterial myocytes have reduced total potassium channel current density, which correlates with a depolarized membrane potential (Vm). These results suggest that SHS exposure induces alterations in key ionic conductances that modulate arterial myocyte contractility and myogenic tone. Thus, chronic exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of SHS impairs mesenteric arterial myocyte electrophysiology and myogenic tone, which may contribute to increased blood pressure and risks of developing vascular complications due to passive exposure to cigarette smoke."

Across two experiments, we found memory enhancements for unrelated faces presented during high-curiosity compared with low-curiosity states, but only when presented shortly after a trivia question.

Given its proximity, it offers the best opportunity to date to study a thermonuclear supernova (SN) over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Optical, near-IR, and mid-IR observations on the rising light curve, orchestrated by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory, show that SN 2014J is a spectroscopically normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), albeit exhibiting high-velocity features in its spectrum and heavily reddened by dust in the host galaxy. Our earliest detections start just hours after the fitted time of explosion. We use high-resolution optical spectroscopy to analyze the dense intervening material and do not detect any evolution in the resolved absorption features during the light curve rise. Similar to other highly reddened SNe Ia, a low value of total-to-selective extinction, RV \u00e2\u2030\u00b2 2, provides the best match to our observations. We also study pre-explosion optical and near-IR images from Hubble Space Telescope with special emphasis on the sources nearest to the SN location. \u00c2\u00a9 2014.

Shoot traits are generally overlooked in these studies, probably because the rosettes are often askew. A technique to assess the shoot surface area of seedlings grown inside agar culture dishes would facilitate simultaneous root and shoot phenotyping.MethodsWe developed an image processing workflow in Python that estimates rosette area of Arabidopsis seedlings on agar culture dishes. We validated this method by comparing its output with other metrics of seedling growth. As part of a larger study on genetic variation in plant responses to nitrogen form and concentration, we measured the rosette areas from more than 2000 plate images.ResultsThe rosette area measured from plate images was strongly correlated with the rosette area measured from directly overhead and moderately correlated with seedling mass. Rosette area in the large image set was significantly influenced by genotype and nitrogen treatment. The broad-sense heritability of leaf area measured using this method was 0.28.DiscussionThese results indicated that this approach for estimating rosette area produces accurate shoot phenotype data. It can be used with image sets for which other methods of leaf area quantification prove unsuitable."

Periodic action potentials (period 1) in healthy conditions bifurcate to other states such as period 2 or chaos when alternans or EADs occur in pathological conditions. The mechanisms of alternans and EADs have been extensively studied under steady-state conditions, but lethal arrhythmias often occur during the transition between steady states. Why arrhythmias tend to develop during the transition is unclear. We used low-dimensional mathematical models to analyze dynamical mechanisms of transient alternans and EADs. We show that depending on the route from one state to another, action potential alternans and EADs may occur during the transition between two periodic steady states. The route taken depends on the time course of external perturbations or intrinsic signaling, such as \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic stimulation, which regulate cardiac calcium and potassium currents with differential kinetics."

Most experiments were performed with an air-inert mixture at 0.1 MPa and about 298 K, where helium, carbon dioxide and xenon were separately used as inerts. Some experiments were also performed at 0.3 MPa and 298 K with air-xenon environments. The amount of inert gas in the environment was progressively increased until droplets could no longer be ignited. Droplet ignitability depended on the gravitational level as well as the inert gas in the environment. The amount of inert gas required to suppress combustion was generally higher in reduced gravity than normal gravity, and use of xenon required significantly higher mole fractions for suppression of combustion relative to helium or carbon dioxide. In general, increasing the amount of inert gas decreased burning rates. The data indicate that ambient gas transport properties play an important role in determining flammability and combustion behaviors of droplets. Comparison with other experimental data obtained with propanol droplets shows that ignitability and combustion characteristics of droplets can also be influenced by the fuel type."

        "abstract": "Focal epilepsies represent approximately half of all diagnoses, and more than one-third of these patients are refractory to pharmacologic treatment. Although resection can result in seizure freedom, many patients do not meet surgical criteria, as seizures may be multifocal in origin or have a focus in an eloquent region of the brain. For these individuals, several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved electrical stimulation paradigms serve as alternative options, including vagus nerve stimulation, responsive neurostimulation, and stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. All of these are safe, flexible, and lead to progressive seizure control over time when used as an adjunctive therapy to antiepileptic drugs. Focal epilepsies frequently involve significant comorbidities such as cognitive decline. Similar to antiepilepsy medications and surgical resection, current stimulation targets and parameters have yet to address cognitive impairments directly, with patients reporting persistent comorbidities associated with focal epilepsy despite a significant reduction in the number of their seizures. Although low-frequency theta oscillations of the septohippocampal network are critical for modulating cellular activity and, in turn, cognitive processing, the coordination of neural excitability is also imperative for preventing seizures. In this review, we summarize current FDA-approved electrical stimulation paradigms and propose that theta oscillations of the medial septal nucleus represent a novel neuromodulation target for concurrent seizure reduction and cognitive improvement in epilepsy. Ultimately, further advancements in clinical neurostimulation strategies will allow for the efficient treatment of both seizures and comorbidities, thereby improving overall quality of life for patients with epilepsy."

Here, we present the first study of the use and suitability of MUSE microscopy for neuropathological samples. MUSE images were generated from surgical biopsy samples of primary and metastatic brain tumor biopsy samples (n = 27), and blinded assessments of diagnoses, tumor grades, and cellular features were compared to corresponding hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) images. A set of MUSE-treated samples subsequently underwent exome and targeted sequencing, and quality metrics were compared to those from fresh frozen specimens. Diagnostic accuracy was relatively high, and DNA and RNA integrity appeared to be preserved for this cohort. This suggests that MUSE may be a reliable method of generating high-quality diagnostic-grade histologic images for neuropathology on a rapid and sample-sparing basis and for subsequent molecular analysis of DNA and RNA."

Communication with brain-computer interfaces has been restricted by extensive training requirements and limited accuracy.MethodsA 45-year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with tetraparesis and severe dysarthria underwent surgical implantation of four microelectrode arrays into his left ventral precentral gyrus 5 years after the onset of the illness; these arrays recorded neural activity from 256 intracortical electrodes. We report the results of decoding his cortical neural activity as he attempted to speak in both prompted and unstructured conversational contexts. Decoded words were displayed on a screen and then vocalized with the use of text-to-speech software designed to sound like his pre-ALS voice.ResultsOn the first day of use (25 days after surgery), the neuroprosthesis achieved 99.6% accuracy with a 50-word vocabulary. Calibration of the neuroprosthesis required 30 minutes of cortical recordings while the participant attempted to speak, followed by subsequent processing. On the second day, after 1.4 additional hours of system training, the neuroprosthesis achieved 90.2% accuracy using a 125,000-word vocabulary. With further training data, the neuroprosthesis sustained 97.5% accuracy over a period of 8.4 months after surgical implantation, and the participant used it to communicate in self-paced conversations at a rate of approximately 32 words per minute for more than 248 cumulative hours.ConclusionsIn a person with ALS and severe dysarthria, an intracortical speech neuroprosthesis reached a level of performance suitable to restore conversational communication after brief training.

Anecdotal reports have suggested that memantine may improve neurologic and cognitive symptoms of individuals with the neurodegenerative disease fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS); however, its efficacy and safety in this population have not been assessed in a controlled trial. Method: Individuals with FXTAS aged 34-80 years were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1-year trial between September 2007 and August 2012. Inclusion required definite, probable, or possible FXTAS in clinical stages 1 -5 according to previously published criteria. Primary outcome measures were the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (BDS) score and CATSYS intention tremor severity. Results: Ninety-four participants were randomized from 205 screened; of those, 43 and 45 started treatment with memantine (titrated to 10 mg twice daily) and placebo, respectively.Thirty-four participants receiving memantine and 36 receiving placebo completed the 1-yearendpoint assessment (n = 70). Intention-to-treat analysis showed no improvement with respect to intention tremor severity (mean [SD] values with memantine vs placebo: 1.05 [0.73] vs 1.89 [2.19], P=.O47) or BDS score (16.12 [5.43] vs 15.72 [3.93], P=.727) at follow-up. Post hoc analyses of participants with early FXTAS (stage < 3), those with late FXTAS (stage > 3), and those in different age groups (<65 years and >65 years) also indicated no significant improvement. More frequent mild adverse events were observed in the placebo group, while more frequent moderate adverse events occurred in the memantine group (P=.OO7). Conclusion:This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of memantine for individuals with FXTAS showed no benefit com pa red to placebo with respect to the selected outcome measures. \u00c2\u00a9 Copyright 2014."

In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using the novel RNAscope 2.0 FFPE assay to localize the expression of Cfh mRNA in the mouse outer retina. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to localize Cfh protein expression, and western blots were used to characterize CFH antibodies used for IHC.ResultsCfh and Cfhr2 transcripts were detected in the mouse RPE/choroid using qPCR, while Cfhr1, Cfhr3, and Cfhrc (Gm4788) were not detected. ISH showed abundant Cfh mRNA in the RPE of all mouse strains (C57BL/6, BALB/c, 129/Sv) tested, with the exception of the Cfh(-/-) eye. Surprisingly, the Cfh protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in photoreceptors rather than in RPE cells. The specificity of the CFH antibodies was tested by western blotting. Our CFH antibodies recognized purified mouse Cfh protein, serum Cfh protein in wild-type C57BL/6, BALB/c, and 129/Sv, and showed an absence of the Cfh protein in the serum of Cfh(-/-) mice. Greatly reduced Cfh protein immunohistological signals in the Cfh(-/-) eyes also supported the specificity of the Cfh protein distribution results.ConclusionsOnly Cfh and Cfhr2 genes are expressed in the mouse outer retina. Only Cfh mRNA was detected in the RPE, but no protein. We hypothesize that the steady-state concentration of Cfh protein is low in the cells due to secretion, and therefore is below the detection level for IHC."

Our results showed that cells mixed with Matrigel at suitable ratios maintained excellent viability (>90%) for one week at room temperature and preserved the properties such as morphology, drug sensitivity and metabolism well, which was comparable to cells cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. We also sent cells in the Matrigel mixture via FedEx service to different places at ambient temperature. Upon arrival, it was found that over 90% of the cells were viable and grew well after replating.

        "abstract": "UnlabelledKinesins are a superfamily of motor proteins and often deregulated in different cancers. However, the mechanism of their deregulation has been poorly understood. Through examining kinesin gene family expression in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells, we found that estrogen stimulation of cancer cell proliferation involves a concerted regulation of specific kinesins. Estrogen strongly induces expression of 19 kinesin genes such as Kif4A/4B, Kif5A/5B, Kif10, Kif11, Kif15, Kif18A/18B, Kif20A/20B, Kif21, Kif23, Kif24, Kif25, and KifC1, whereas suppresses the expression of seven others, including Kif1A, Kif1C, Kif7, and KifC3. Interestingly, the bromodomain protein ANCCA/ATAD2, previously shown to be an estrogen-induced chromatin regulator, plays a crucial role in the up- and downregulation of kinesins by estrogen. Its overexpression drives estrogen-independent upregulation of specific kinesins. Mechanistically, ANCCA (AAA nuclear coregulator cancer associated) mediates E2-dependent recruitment of E2F and MLL1 histone methyltransferase at kinesin gene promoters for gene activation-associated H3K4me3 methylation. Importantly, elevated levels of Kif4A, Kif15, Kif20A, and Kif23 correlate with that of ANCCA in the tumors and with poor relapse-free survival of patients with ER-positive breast cancer. Their knockdown strongly impeded proliferation and induced apoptosis of both tamoxifen-sensitive and resistant cancer cells. Together, the study reveals ANCCA as a key mediator of kinesin family deregulation in breast cancer and the crucial role of multiple kinesins in growth and survival of the tumor cells.ImplicationsThese findings support the development of novel inhibitors of cancer-associated kinesins and their regulator ANCCA for effective treatment of cancers including tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers."

        "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming such as the aerobic glycolysis or Warburg effect is well recognized as a common feature of tumorigenesis. However, molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic alterations for tumor therapeutic resistance are poorly understood. Through gene expression profiling analysis we found that histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1 expression was highly elevated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumors. IHC analysis indicated that NSD2 protein overexpression was associated with the disease recurrence and poor survival. Ectopic expression of NSD2 wild type, but not the methylase-defective mutant, drove endocrine resistance in multiple cell models and xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, NSD2 was recruited to and methylated H3K36me2 at the promoters of key glucose metabolic enzyme genes. Its overexpression coordinately up-regulated hexokinase 2 (HK2) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), two key enzymes of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), as well as TP53-induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase TIGAR. Consequently, NSD2-driven tamoxifen-resistant cells and tumors displayed heightened PPP activity, elevated NADPH production, and reduced ROS level, without significantly altered glycolysis. These results illustrate a coordinated, epigenetic activation of key glucose metabolic enzymes in therapeutic resistance and nominate methyltransferase NSD2 as a potential therapeutic target for endocrine resistant breast cancer."

        "abstract": "Dialkylglycine decarboxylase (DGD) is an unusual pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes decarboxylation in the first and transamination in the second half-reaction of its ping-pong catalytic cycle. Directed evolution was employed to alter the substrate specificity of DGD from 2-aminoisobutyrate (AIB) to 1-aminocyclohexane-1-carboxylate (AC6C). Four rounds of directed evolution led to the identification of several mutants, with clones in the final rounds containing five persistent mutations. The best clones show ~2.5-fold decrease in KM and ~2-fold increase in kcat, giving a modest ~5-fold increase in catalytic efficiency for AC6C. Additional rounds of directed evolution did not improve catalytic activity toward AC6C. Only one (S306F) of the five persistent mutations is close to the active site. S306F was observed in all 33 clones except one, and the mutation is shown to stabilize the enzyme toward denaturation. The other four persistent mutations are near the surface of the enzyme. The S306F mutation and the distal mutations all have significant effects on the kinetic parameters for AIB and AC6C. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the mutations alter the conformational landscape of the enzyme, favoring a more open active site conformation that facilitates the reactivity of the larger substrate. We speculate that the small increases in kcat/KM for AC6C are due to two constraints. The first is the mechanistic requirement for catalyzing oxidative decarboxylation via a concerted decarboxylation/proton transfer transition state. The second is that DGD must catalyze transamination at the same active site in the second half-reaction of the ping-pong catalytic cycle."

A central reaction in the cycle involves the reduction of nitrate (NO(-) 3) to nitrite (NO(-) 2) catalyzed by nitrate reductase (NR). Discrimination against (15)N by NR is a major determinant of isotopic differences among N pools. Here, we measured in vitro (15)N discrimination by several NRs purified from plants, fungi, and a bacterium to determine the intrinsic (15)N discrimination by the enzyme and to evaluate the validity of measurements made using (15)N-enriched NO(-) 3. Observed NR isotope discrimination ranged from 22 to 32\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0 (kinetic isotope effects of 1.022-1.032) among the different isozymes at natural abundance (15)N (0.37%). As the fractional (15)N content of substrate NO(-) 3 increased from natural abundance, the product (15)N fraction deviated significantly from that expected based on substrate enrichment and (15)N discrimination measured at natural abundance. Additionally, isotopic discrimination by denitrifying bacteria used to reduce NO(-) 3 and NO(-) 2 in some protocols became a greater source of error as (15)N enrichment increased. We briefly discuss potential causes of the experimental artifacts with enriched (15)N and recommend against the use of highly enriched (15)N tracers to study N discrimination in plants or soils."

        "abstract": "Background Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a standard treatment of early-stage, medically inoperable lung cancer. Limited data have evaluated the radiation pneumonitis (RP) risk with SBRT after previous anatomic lung resection (ALR). We assessed the incidence of RP and all pulmonary toxicity (PT) in patients who underwent lung SBRT after ALR and compared them with those of patients without previous ALR. Materials and Methods We reviewed the medical records of 84 consecutively treated patients with stage T1-T2b non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with 88 courses of SBRT for 94 lung tumors from January 2007 to December 2014, including 17 patients with previous ALR. The rates of RP and all PT were compared between the patients with and without previous ALR. Results At a median follow-up duration of 18.3 months (range, 1.8-85.6 months), the crude grade 2+ RP rate was 5.9% and 2.8% for patients with and without previous ALR, respectively (P =.51). The corresponding 2-year estimates of freedom from RP were 89% and 97% (P =.51). The crude rate of all grade 2+ PT was 11.8% and 2.8% for those with and without previous ALR (P =.11), with 2-year estimates of freedom from PT of 97% and 84% (P =.11), respectively. The 2 cohorts were well matched by the mean lung dose, percentage of lung volume receiving 20 Gy (P =.86), and prescribed dose (P =.75). The 2-year estimates of local control, cause-specific survival, and overall survival were similar between the 2 cohorts. Conclusion The observed rates of PT were low among all patients, with a trend toward increased grade 2 and 3 lung toxicity among patients with previous ALR. Previous ALR did not increase the risk of grade 4 and 5 RP, and SBRT appears safe and effective in this population."

        "abstract": "Stages of change measure an individual's readiness to alter a health behavior. This study examined the latent longitudinal patterns of stages of change (SoC) for regular exercise over time among individuals participating in a lifestyle intervention project. It also investigated the association between the longitudinal patterns of SoC and intervention outcomes using a new statistical method to assess the relationship between latent class membership and distal outcomes. We analyzed data from the Special Diabetes Program for Indians Diabetes Prevention Program, a lifestyle intervention program to prevent diabetes among American Indians and Alaska Natives. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify the longitudinal patterns of SoC for regular exercise reported at three time points. LCA with distal outcomes was performed to investigate the associations between latent class membership and behavioral changes after the intervention. The parameters and standard errors of the LCA with distal outcomes models were estimated using an improved three-step approach. Three latent classes were identified: Pre-action, Transition, and Maintenance classes. The Transition class, where stage progression occurred, had the greatest improvements in physical activity and weight outcomes at both time points post-baseline among female participants. It also had the largest improvements in weight outcomes among male participants. Furthermore, the Pre-action class had more attenuation in the improvements they had achieved initially than the other two classes. These findings suggest the potential importance of motivating participants to modify their readiness for behavioral change in future lifestyle interventions."

Linear mixed-models were fitted for continuous outcome variables and GEE models with logit link function for binary outcome variables. At baseline, over 52% of participants had Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test times of 12 s or more, which indicates below-normal performance. On average, participants showed significant reductions in TUG test scores at the postintervention (11% reduction, p < .001). Participants also showed significant improvements in general health status (p = .002), unhealthy physical days (p = .032), combined unhealthy physical and mental days (p = .006), and days limited from usual activity (p = .045).

        "abstract": "High-protein (HP) diets help prevent loss of lean mass in calorie-restricted (CR) cats. However, it is not entirely known whether these diets also induce changes of energy expenditure during periods of CR. To investigate this issue, sixteen overweight cats were fed either a high-protein [(HP), 54.2% of metabolizable energy (ME)] or a moderate-protein [(MP), 31.5% of ME] diet at 70% of their maintenance energy intakes for 8 weeks, and energy expenditure, energy intake, body weight and composition, and serum metabolites and hormones were measured. While both groups of cats lost weight at a similar rate, only cats eating the HP diet maintained lean mass during weight loss. Indirect respiration calorimetry measurements revealed that both total and resting energy expenditure (kcal/d) significantly decreased during weight loss for both treatment groups. However, only cats eating the MP diet exhibited significant decreases of total and resting energy expenditures after energy expenditure was normalized for body weight or lean mass. Results from this study suggest that in addition to sparing the loss of lean mass, feeding HP diets to overweight cats in restricted amounts may be beneficial for preventing or minimizing decreases of mass-adjusted energy expenditure during weight loss."

        "abstract": "Folate, an essential nutrient found naturally in foods in a reduced form, is present in dietary supplements and fortified foods in an oxidized synthetic form (folic acid). There is widespread agreement that maintaining adequate folate status is critical to prevent diseases due to folate inadequacy (e.g., anemia, birth defects, and cancer). However, there are concerns of potential adverse effects of excess folic acid intake and/or elevated folate status, with the original concern focused on exacerbation of clinical effects of vitamin B-12 deficiency and its role in neurocognitive health. More recently, animal and observational studies have suggested potential adverse effects on cancer risk, birth outcomes, and other diseases. Observations indicating adverse effects from excess folic acid intake, elevated folate status, and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) remain inconclusive; the data do not provide the evidence needed to affect public health recommendations. Moreover, strong biological and mechanistic premises connecting elevated folic acid intake, UMFA, and/or high folate status to adverse health outcomes are lacking. However, the body of evidence on potential adverse health outcomes indicates the need for comprehensive research to clarify these issues and bridge knowledge gaps. Three key research questions encompass the additional research needed to establish whether high folic acid or total folate intake contributes to disease risk. 1) Does UMFA affect biological pathways leading to adverse health effects? 2) Does elevated folate status resulting from any form of folate intake affect vitamin B-12 function and its roles in sustaining health? 3) Does elevated folate intake, regardless of form, affect biological pathways leading to adverse health effects other than those linked to vitamin B-12 function? This article summarizes the proceedings of an August 2019 NIH expert workshop focused on addressing these research areas."

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has called for research on the optimal time to clamp the cord during cesarean deliveries (CD). Our objective was to conduct a pilot trial examining the safety of delayed cord clamping (DCC) for maternal-infant dyads during elective cesarean delivery (CD).MethodsWe enrolled 39 dyads [23 at 90&nbsp;s, 16 at 120&nbsp;s; (DCC Pilot)] between 10/2013 and 9/2014.

In total, 53.24% of phenotypic variance is explained by genetics, but known AD SNPs only explain 30.62% of the genetic variance. Of the unexplained genetic variance, approximately 41% is explained by unknown SNPs in regions adjacent to known AD SNPs, and the remaining unexplained genetic variance outside these regions."

        "abstract": "Proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragments (CTFs) by \u00ce\u00b3-secretase underlies the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An RNA interference screen using APP-CTF [99-residue CTF (C99)]- and Notch-specific \u00ce\u00b3-secretase interaction assays identified a unique ErbB2-centered signaling network that was predicted to preferentially govern the proteostasis of APP-C99. Consistently, significantly elevated levels of ErbB2 were confirmed in the hippocampus of human AD brains. We then found that ErbB2 effectively suppressed autophagic flux by physically dissociating Beclin-1 from the Vps34-Vps15 complex independent of its kinase activity. Down-regulation of ErbB2 by CL-387,785 decreased the levels of C99 and secreted amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 in cellular, zebrafish, and mouse models of AD, through the activation of autophagy. Oral administration of an ErbB2-targeted CL-387,785 for 3 wk significantly improves the cognitive functions of APP/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice. This work unveils a noncanonical function of ErbB2 in modulating autophagy and establishes ErbB2 as a therapeutic target for AD."

As Kv1.3 is also expressed on microglia and has been shown to be specifically up-regulated on \"M1-like\" microglia, we here tested the therapeutic hypothesis that the brain-penetrant small-molecule Kv1.3-inhibitor PAP-1 reduces secondary inflammatory damage after ischemia/reperfusion.MethodsWe studied microglial Kv1.3 expression using electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry, and evaluated PAP-1 in hypoxia-exposed organotypic hippocampal slices and in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with 8 days of reperfusion in both adult male C57BL/6J mice (60&nbsp;min MCAO) and adult male Wistar rats (90&nbsp;min MCAO). In both models, PAP-1 administration was started 12&nbsp;h after reperfusion.ResultsWe observed Kv1.3 staining on activated microglia in ischemic infarcts in mice, rats, and humans and found higher Kv1.3 current densities in acutely isolated microglia from the infarcted hemisphere than in microglia isolated from the contralateral hemisphere of MCAO mice. PAP-1 reduced microglia activation and increased neuronal survival in hypoxia-exposed hippocampal slices as effectively as minocycline. In mouse MCAO, PAP-1 dose-dependently reduced infarct area, improved neurological deficit score, and reduced brain levels of IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 and IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 without affecting IL-10 and brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) levels or inhibiting ongoing phagocytosis. The beneficial effects on infarct area and neurological deficit score were reproduced in rats providing confirmation in a second species.InterpretationOur findings suggest that Kv1.3 constitutes a promising therapeutic target for preferentially inhibiting \"M1-like\" inflammatory microglia/macrophage functions in ischemic stroke."

        "abstract": "Significance5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence is currently used for image-guided glioma resection. Typically, this widefield imaging method highlights the bulk of high-grade gliomas, but it underperforms at the infiltrating edge where PpIX fluorescence is not visible to the eyes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) has the potential to detect PpIX fluorescence below the visible detection threshold. Moreover, simultaneous acquisition of time-resolved nicotinamide adenine (phosphate) dinucleotide [NAD(P)H] fluorescence may provide metabolic information from the tumor environment to further improve overall tumor detection.AimWe investigate the ability of pulse sampling, fiber-based FLIm to simultaneously image PpIX and NAD(P)H fluorescence of glioma infiltrative margins in patients.ApproachA mesoscopic fiber-based point-scanning FLIm device (355&nbsp;nm pulses) was used to simultaneously resolve the fluorescence decay of PpIX (629/53&nbsp;nm) and NAD(P)H (470/28&nbsp;nm). The FLIm device enabled data acquisition at room light and rapid (<33\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u2030ms) augmentation of FLIm parameters on the surgical field-of-view. FLIm measurements from superficial tumors and tissue areas around the resection margins were performed on three glioblastoma patients in vivo following inspection of PpIX visible fluorescence with a conventional neurosurgical microscope. Microbiopsies were collected from FLIm imaged areas for histopathological evaluation.ResultsThe average lifetime from PpIX and NAD(P)H fluorescence distinguished between tumor and surrounding tissue. FLIm measurements of resection margins presented a range of PpIX and NAD(P)H lifetime values (\u00cf\u201ePpIX\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u0081\u0178\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u20303 to 14&nbsp;ns, \u00cf\u201eNAD(P)H\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u20303 to 6&nbsp;ns) associated with unaffected tissue and areas of low-density tumor infiltration.ConclusionsIntraoperative FLIm could simultaneously detect the emission of PpIX and NAD(P)H from patients in vivo during craniotomy procedures. This approach doubles as a clinical tool to identify tumor areas while performing tissue resection and as a research tool to study tumor microenvironmental changes in vivo. Intraoperative FLIm of 5-ALA-induced PpIX and tissue autofluorescence makes a promising surgical adjunct to guide tumor resection surgery."

The purpose of this article is to review nutrition strategies related to muscle regeneration, glycogen restoration, fatigue, physical and immune health, and preparation for subsequent training bouts and competitions. Given the limited opportunities to recover between training bouts and games throughout the competitive season, athletes must be deliberate in their recovery strategy. Foundational components of recovery related to protein, carbohydrates, and fluid have been extensively reviewed and accepted. Micronutrients and supplements that may be efficacious for promoting recovery include vitamin D, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, creatine, collagen/vitamin C, and antioxidants. Curcumin and bromelain may also provide a recovery benefit during the competitive season but future research is warranted prior to incorporating supplemental dosages into the athlete's diet. Air travel poses nutritional challenges related to nutrient timing and quality. Incorporating strategies to consume efficacious micronutrients and ingredients is necessary to support athlete recovery in season."

        "abstract": "ImportanceIndividuals with the fragile X premutation express expanded CGG repeats (repeats 55-200) in the FMR1 gene and elevated FMR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, both of which may underlie the occurrence of the late-onset neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Because the core feature of FXTAS is motor impairment, determining the influence of FMR1 mRNA levels on structural connectivity of motor fiber tracts is critical for a better understanding of the pathologic features of FXTAS.ObjectiveTo examine the associations of CGG repeat and FMR1 mRNA with motor-related fiber tracts in males with premutation alleles.Design and settingA case-control study conducted at the University of California, Davis, from April 1, 2008, through August 31, 2009. All data were collected masked to the carrier status of the FMR1 gene.ParticipantsThirty-six male premutation carriers with FXTAS and 26 male premutation carriers without FXTAS were recruited through their family relationships with children affected by fragile X syndrome. The controls were 34 unaffected family members and healthy volunteers from the local community.Main outcomes and measuresThe CGG repeat lengths and FMR1 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes, motor functioning, and white matter structural integrity that were estimated using diffusion tensor imaging. After data collection, we selected 4 motor tracts to reconstruct using diffusion tensor tractography, namely, the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, descending motor tracts (containing the corticospinal, corticobulbar, and corticopontine tracts), and the anterior body of the corpus callosum.ResultsAll fiber tracts exhibited weaker structural connectivity in the FXTAS group (decreased 5%-53% from controls, P \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 .02). Genetic imaging correlation analysis revealed negative associations of CGG repeat length and FMR1 mRNA with connectivity strength of the superior cerebellar peduncles in both premutation groups (partial r\u00c2\u00b2 = 0.23-0.33, P \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 .004). In addition, the measurements from the corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles revealed a high correlation with motor functioning in all 3 groups (r between partial least square predicted and actual test scores = 0.41-0.56, P \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 .04).Conclusions and relevanceDistinct pathophysiologic processes may underlie the structural impairment of the motor tracts in FXTAS. Although both the corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles were of great importance to motor functioning, only the superior cerebellar peduncles exhibited an association with the elevated RNA levels in the blood of fragile X premutation carriers."

However, the majority of these studies focused on mothers of children with fragile X syndrome, who experience higher rates of parenting stress that may contribute to the emergence of these disorders. The present study compared psychiatric symptom presentation (utilizing measures of current symptoms and lifetime DSM-IV Axis I disorders) in 24 female carriers without affected children (mean age\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203032.1 years) to 26 non-carrier women from the community (mean age\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203030.5 years). We also examined the association between CGG repeat size (adjusted for X activation ratio) and mRNA, with severity of psychiatric symptoms. Women with the premutation reported significantly elevated symptoms of anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsiveness, and somatization relative to controls during the past week. Carriers had significantly higher rates of lifetime social phobia (42.3%) compared to controls (12.5%); however, this comparison did not remain significant after multiple comparison adjustment. Rates of other psychiatric disorders were not significantly elevated relative to controls, though it should be noted that lifetime rates among controls were much higher than previously published population estimates. Although the sample is relatively small, the study of this unique cohort suggests the premutation confers risk for mood and anxiety disorders independent of the stress of parenting children with FXS. Screening for psychiatric disorders in women with the premutation, even before they become parents, is important and highly encouraged. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

        "abstract": "Preclinical data suggest that inhibition of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) receptor might hold therapeutic benefits in Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Treatment of Fmr1 knockout mice with mGluR5-negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) has been reported to correct a broad range of phenotypes related to FXS. The early short-term clinical trials with mGluR5 NAMs, including basimglurant, assessing the effects in individuals with FXS, were supportive of further exploration in larger, well-controlled trials. We evaluated basimglurant, a potent and selective mGluR5 NAM, in a 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group study of 183 adults and adolescents (aged 14-50, mean 23.4 years) with FXS. Individuals with an FMR1 full mutation were randomized to placebo or one of two doses of basimglurant. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in behavioral symptoms using the Anxiety Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS) total score. All treatment arms showed marked behavioral improvements from baseline to week 12 with less improvement in the basimglurant 1.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg arm than placebo; however, basimglurant 0.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg was inferior to placebo in the ADAMs total score. Treatment with basimglurant was overall well-tolerated. A higher incidence of adverse events classified as psychiatric disorders were reported in patients treated with basimglurant, including three patients with hallucinations or psychosis. In this phase 2 clinical trial, basimglurant did not demonstrate improvement over placebo. Evaluation of the overall risk-benefit in younger patient populations is an important consideration for the design of potential further investigations of efficacy with this class of medications."

We compared the distributional characteristics and Q-Q plots from the standardized scores with the deviation z-scores. Additionally, we examined the relationship between both scoring methods and multiple criterion measures.ResultsWe found evidence that substantial and meaningful variation in cognitive ability on standardized IQ tests among individuals with ID is lost when converting raw scores to standardized scaled, index and IQ scores. Use of the deviation z- score method rectifies this problem, and accounts for significant additional variance in criterion validation measures, above and beyond the usual IQ scores. Additionally, individual and group-level cognitive strengths and weaknesses are recovered using deviation scores.ConclusionTraditional methods for generating IQ scores in lower functioning individuals with ID are inaccurate and inadequate, leading to erroneously flat profiles. However assessment of cognitive abilities is substantially improved by measuring true deviation in performance from standardization sample norms. This work has important implications for standardized test development, clinical assessment, and research for which IQ is an important measure of interest in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and other forms of cognitive impairment."

        "abstract": "Salmonella Typhi is an exclusive human pathogen that causes typhoid fever. Typhoid toxin is a S. Typhi virulence factor that can reproduce most of the typhoid fever symptoms in experimental animals. Toxicity depends on toxin binding to terminally sialylated glycans on surface glycoproteins. Human glycans are unusual because of the lack of CMAH, which in other mammals converts N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Here, we report that typhoid toxin binds to and is toxic toward cells expressing glycans terminated in Neu5Ac (expressed by humans) over glycans terminated in Neu5Gc (expressed by other mammals). Mice constitutively expressing CMAH thus displaying Neu5Gc in all tissues are resistant to typhoid toxin. The atomic structure of typhoid toxin bound to Neu5Ac reveals the structural bases for its binding specificity. These findings provide insight into the molecular bases for Salmonella Typhi's host specificity and may help the development of therapies for typhoid fever."

        "abstract": "Sialic acids (Sias) are important glycans displayed on the cells and tissues of many different animals and are frequent targets for binding and modification by pathogens, including influenza viruses. Influenza virus hemagglutinins bind Sias during the infection of their normal hosts, while the encoded neuraminidases and/or esterases remove or modify the Sia to allow virion release or to prevent rebinding. Sias naturally occur in a variety of modified forms, and modified Sias can alter influenza virus host tropisms through their altered interactions with the viral glycoproteins. However, the distribution of modified Sia forms and their effects on pathogen-host interactions are still poorly understood. Here we used probes developed from viral Sia-binding proteins to detect O-acetylated (4-O-acetyl, 9-O-acetyl, and 7,9-O-acetyl) Sias displayed on the tissues of some natural or experimental hosts for influenza viruses. These modified Sias showed highly variable displays between the hosts and tissues examined. The 9-O-acetyl (and 7,9-) modified Sia forms were found on cells and tissues of many hosts, including mice, humans, ferrets, guinea pigs, pigs, horses, dogs, as well as in those of ducks and embryonated chicken egg tissues and membranes, although in variable amounts. The 4-O-acetyl Sias were found in the respiratory tissues of fewer animals, being primarily displayed in the horse and guinea pig, but were not detected in humans or pigs. The results suggest that these Sia variants may influence virus tropisms by altering and selecting their cell interactions. IMPORTANCE Sialic acids (Sias) are key glycans that control or modulate many normal cell and tissue functions while also interacting with a variety of pathogens, including many different viruses. Sias are naturally displayed in a variety of different forms, with modifications at several positions that can alter their functional interactions with pathogens. In addition, Sias are often modified or removed by enzymes such as host or pathogen esterases or sialidases (neuraminidases), and Sia modifications can alter those enzymatic activities to impact pathogen infections. Sia chemical diversity in different hosts and tissues likely alters the pathogen-host interactions and influences the outcome of infection. Here we explored the display of 4-O-acetyl, 9-O-acetyl, and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia forms in some target tissues for influenza virus infection in mice, humans, birds, guinea pigs, ferrets, swine, horses, and dogs, which encompass many natural and laboratory hosts of those viruses."

A control diet (CD) and Western diet (WD), which contains high fat and carbohydrate, were used to feed wild type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) mice followed by phenotyping characterization as well as BA and microbiota profiling. Our data revealed that male WD-fed FXR KO mice had the most severe steatosis and highest hepatic and serum lipids as well as insulin resistance among the eight studied groups. Gender differences in WD-induced steatosis, insulin sensitivity, and predicted microbiota functions were all FXR-dependent. FXR deficiency enriched Desulfovibrionaceae, Deferribacteraceae, and Helicobacteraceae, which were accompanied by increased hepatic taurine-conjugated cholic acid and \u00ce\u00b2-muricholic acid as well as hepatic and serum lipids. Additionally, distinct microbiota profiles were found in WD-fed WT mice harboring simple steatosis and CD-fed FXR KO mice, in which the steatosis had a potential to develop into liver cancer. Together, the presented data revealed FXR-dependent concomitant relationships between gut microbiota, BAs, and metabolic diseases in both genders. Gender differences in BAs and microbiota may account for gender dissimilarity in metabolism and metabolic diseases."

In this study, we investigated behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates of trait self-boundarylessness during resting state and the performance of two experimental tasks. We found that boundarylessness correlated with greater self-endorsement of words related to fluidity and with longer response times in a math task. Boundarylessness also correlated negatively with brain activity in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus during mind-wandering compared to a task targeting a minimal sense of self. Interestingly, boundarylessness showed quadratic relations to several measures. Participants reporting low or high boundarylessness, as compared to those in between, showed higher functional connectivity within the default mode network during rest, less brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex during self-referential word processing, and less self-endorsement of words related to constancy. We relate these results to our previous findings of a quadratic relation between boundarylessness and the sense of perspectival ownership of experience. Additionally, an instruction to direct attention to the centre of experience elicited brain activation similar to that of meditation onset, including increases in anterior precentral gyrus and anterior insula and decreases in default mode network areas, for both non-meditators and experienced meditators."

        "abstract": "Using data from a water-balance instrument cluster with spatially distributed sensors we determined the magnitude and within-catchment variability of components of the catchmentscale water balance, focusing on the relationship of seasonal evapotranspiration to changes in snowpack and soil moisture storage. Co-located, continuous snow depth and soil moisture measurements were deployed in a rain-snow transition catchment in the mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada. At each elevation sensors were placed in the open, under the canopy, and at the drip edge on both north- and south-facing slopes. Snow sensors were placed at 27 locations, with soil moisture and temperature sensors placed at depths of 10, 30, 60, and 90 cm beneath the snow sensor. Soils are weakly developed (Inceptisols and Entisols) and formed from decomposed granite with properties that change with elevation. The soil- bedrock interface is hard in upper reaches of the basin (>2000 m) where glaciers have scoured the parent material approximately 18,000 yr ago. Below an elevation of 2000 m soils have a paralithic contact (weathered saprolite) that can extend beyond a depth of 1.5 m, facilitating pathways for deep percolation. Soils are wet and not frozen in winter, and dry out in the weeks following spring snowmelt and rain. Based on data from two snowmelt seasons, it was found that soils dry out following snowmelt at relatively uniform rates; however, the timing of drying at a given site may be offset by up to 4 wk because of heterogeneity in snowmelt at different elevations and aspects. Spring and summer rainfall mainly affected sites in the open, with drying after a rain event being faster than following snowmelt. Water loss rates from soil of 0.5 to 1.0 cm d -1 during the winter and snowmelt season reflect a combination of evapotranspiration and deep drainage, as stream baseflow remains relatively low. About one-third of annual evapotranspiration comes from water storage below the 1-m depth, that is, below mapped soil. We speculate that much of the deep drainage is stored locally in the deeper regolith during periods of high precipitation, being available for tree transpiration during summer and fall months when shallow soil water storage is limiting. Total annual evapotranspiration for water year 2009 was estimated to be approximately 76 cm. \u00c2\u00a9 Soil Science Society of America."

        "abstract": "Following repeated opioid use, some dependent individuals experience persistent cognitive deficits that contribute to relapse of drug-taking behaviors, and one component of this response may be mediated by the endogenous dynorphin/kappa opioid system in neocortex. In C57BL/6 male mice, we find that acute morphine withdrawal evokes dynorphin release in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and disrupts cognitive function by activation of local kappa opioid receptors (KORs). Immunohistochemical analyses using a phospho-KOR antibody confirmed that both withdrawal-induced and optically evoked dynorphin release activated KOR in PFC. Using a genetically encoded sensor based on inert KOR (kLight1.2a), we revealed the in vivo dynamics of endogenous dynorphin release in the PFC. Local activation of KOR in PFC produced multi-phasic disruptions of memory processing in an operant-delayed alternation behavioral task, which manifest as reductions in response number and accuracy during early and late phases of an operant session. Local pretreatment in PFC with the selective KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) blocked the disruptive effect of systemic KOR activation during both early and late phases of the session. The early, but not late phase disruption was blocked by viral excision of PFC KORs, suggesting an anatomically dissociable contribution of pre- and postsynaptic KORs. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice or optical stimulation of pdynCre neurons using Channelrhodopsin-2 disrupted delayed alternation performance, and the dynorphin-induced effect was blocked by local norBNI. Our findings describe a mechanism for control of cortical function during opioid dependence and suggest that KOR antagonism could promote abstinence."

Ca (2+) influx via the NMDAR triggers CaMKII binding to the NMDAR for enhanced CaMKII accumulation at post-synaptic sites that experience heightened activity as occurring during LTP. Previously, we generated knock-in (KI) mice in which we replaced two residues in the NMDAR GluN2B subunit to impair CaMKII binding to GluN2B. Various forms of LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1 are reduced by 50%. Nevertheless, working memory in the win-shift 8 arm maze and learning of the Morris water maze (MWM) task was normal in the KI mice although recall of the task was impaired in these mice during the period of early memory consolidation. We now show that massed training in the MWM task within a single day resulted in impaired learning. However, learning and recall of the Barnes maze task and contextual fear conditioning over one or multiple days were surprisingly unaffected. The differences observed in the MWM compared to the Barnes maze and contextual fear conditioning suggest a differential involvement of CaMKII and the specific interaction with GluN2B, probably depending on varying degrees of stress, cognitive demand or even potentially different plasticity mechanisms associated with the diverse tasks."

        "abstract": "L-type voltage-gated CaV1.2 calcium channels (CaV1.2) are key regulators of neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and excitation-transcription coupling. Surface-exposed CaV1.2 distributes in clusters along the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. A permanent exchange between stably clustered and laterally diffusive extra-clustered channels maintains steady-state levels of CaV1.2 at dendritic signaling domains. A dynamic equilibrium between anchored and diffusive receptors is a common feature among ion channels and is crucial to modulate signaling transduction. Despite the importance of this fine regulatory system, the molecular mechanisms underlying the surface dynamics of CaV1.2 are completely unexplored. Here, we examined the dynamic states of CaV1.2 depending on phosphorylation on Ser-1700 and Ser-1928 at the channel C terminus. Phosphorylation at these sites is strongly involved in CaV1.2-mediated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling, long-term potentiation, and responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation. We engineered CaV1.2 constructs mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-1700 and Ser-1928 and analyzed their behavior at the membrane by immunolabeling protocols, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and single particle tracking. We found that the phosphomimetic S1928E variant increases the mobility of CaV1.2 without altering the steady-state maintenance of cluster in young neurons and favors channel stabilization later in differentiation. Instead, mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-1700 promoted the diffusive state of CaV1.2 irrespective of the differentiation stage. Together, these results reveal that phosphorylation could contribute to the establishment of channel anchoring mechanisms depending on the neuronal differentiation state. Finally, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which phosphorylation at the C terminus regulates calcium signaling by tuning the content of CaV1.2 at signaling complexes."

In this study, we investigated the use of fresh, autologous, adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) for feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS), a chronic, debilitating, idiopathic, oral mucosal inflammatory disease. Nine cats with refractory FCGS were enrolled in this pilot study. Each cat received 2 intravenous injections of 20 million autologous ASCs, 1 month apart. Oral biopsies were taken before and at 6 months after the first ASC injection. Blood immune cell subsets, serum protein, and cytokine levels were measured at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to assess immunomodulatory effects. Seven of the 9 cats completed the study. Five cats responded to treatment by either complete clinical remission (n=3) or substantial clinical improvement (n=2). Two cats were nonresponders. Cats that responded to treatment also exhibited systemic immunomodulation demonstrated by decreased numbers of circulating CD8+ T cells, a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio, decreased neutrophil counts, and interferon-\u00ce\u00b3 and interleukin (IL)-1\u00ce\u00b2 concentration, and a temporary increase in serum IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u00ce\u00b1 concentration. No clinical recurrence has occurred following complete clinical remission (follow-up of 6-24 months). In this study, cats with <15% cytotoxic CD8 T cells with low expression of CD8 (CD8lo) cells were 100% responsive to ASC therapy, whereas cats with >15% CD8lo cells were nonresponders. The relative absence of CD8lo cells may be a biomarker to predict response to ASC therapy, and may shed light on pathogenesis of FCGS and mechanisms by which ASCs decrease oral inflammation and affect T-cell phenotype.SignificanceThis study is the first to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of fresh, autologous, adipose-derived stem cell systemic therapy for a naturally occurring, chronic inflammatory disease in cats. The findings demonstrate that this therapy resulted in complete clinical and histological resolution or reduction in clinical disease severity and immune modulation in most cats. This study also identified a potentially useful biomarker that could dictate patient enrollment and shed light on immune modulation mechanism. As a naturally occurring animal model, FCGS also provides a strategic platform for potentially translatable therapy for the treatment of human oral inflammatory disease."

        "abstract": "BackgroundStudies assessing immune parameters typically utilize human PBMCs or murine splenocytes to generate data that is interpreted as representative of immune status. Using splenocytes, we have shown memory CD4-T cells that expand following systemic immunostimulatory therapies undergo rapid IFNg-mediated activation induced cell death (AICD) resulting in a net loss of total CD4-T cells which correlates with elevated PD-1 expression. This is in contrast to CD8-T cells which expand with minimal PD-1 upregulation and apoptosis. In this study we expand upon our previous work by evaluating CD4 and CD8-T cell phenotype and distribution in peripheral organs which are more representative of immune responses occurring at metastatic sites following immunotherapy.MethodsPhenotypic assessment of T cells in both lymphoid (spleen and LN) as well as peripheral organs (liver and lungs) in control and immunotherapy treated mice was performed to survey the impact of location on memory phenotype and activation marker status. Peripheral blood from patients undergoing systemic high dose IL-2 was also assessed for expression of PD-1 and memory phenotype.ResultsHere we reveal that, similar to what occurs in the spleen and lymph nodes, CD4-T cell numbers decreased while CD8-T cells expanded at these peripheral sites. In contrast to having differential expression of PD-1 as occurs in the spleen, both CD4 and CD8-T cells had significantly elevated levels of PD-1 in both the liver and lungs. Further analysis correlated PD-1 expression to CD62Llow (T effector/effector memory,TE/EM) expression which are more prevalent in CD4-T cells in general as well as CD8-T cells in peripheral organs. Similar elevated PD-1 expression on TE/EM cells was observed in patients undergoing systemic high-dose IL-2 therapy.ConclusionsThese data highlight PD-1 expressing and/or TE/EM subsets of T cells in circulation as more representative of cells at immune sites and underscore the importance of valuation both in lymphoid as well as target organs when making determinations about immune status.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT01416831.

Here, we investigate the use of fresh allogeneic ASCs for treatment of FCGS in seven cats. Radiolabeled ASCs were also tracked systemically. Each cat received two intravenous injections of 20 million ASCs, 1 month apart. Oral inflammation, blood lymphocyte subsets, anti-fetal bovine serum antibody levels, ASC crossmatching and serum proteins and cytokine concentrations were determined. Four of the 7 cats (57%) responded to treatment [complete clinical remission (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20302) or substantial clinical improvement (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20302)]. Three cats were nonresponders. Prior to therapy, most cats had increased circulating CD8+ T cells, decreased CD8lo cells, and a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, however clinical resolution was not associated with normalization of these parameters. Nonresponders showed more severe systemic inflammation (neutrophilia, hyperglobulinemia and increased interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration) prior to ASC therapy. Clinical remission took up to 20 months and no clinical relapse has occurred. A higher fraction of radiolabeled ASCs were identified in the oral cavity of FCGS affected cats than the control cat. The administration of fresh, allogenic ASCs appeared to have lower clinical efficacy with a delayed response as compared to the fresh, autologous ASCs.

While the role of Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) on antigen-specific T cell responses is extensively characterized, its role in bystander T cell responses is less clear. We examined the role of the PD-1 pathway during human and mouse non-antigen-specific memory T cell bystander activation and observed that PD-1+ T cells demonstrated less activation and proliferation than activated PD-1- populations in vitro. Higher activation and proliferative responses were also observed in the PD-1- memory population in both mice and patients with cancer receiving high-dose IL-2, mirroring the in vitro phenotypes. This inhibitory effect of PD-1 could be reversed by PD-1 blockade in vivo or observed using memory T cells from PD-1-/- mice. Interestingly, increased activation through abrogation of PD-1 signaling in bystander-activated T cells also resulted in increased apoptosis due to activation-induced cell death (AICD) and eventual T cell loss in vivo. These results demonstrate that the PD-1/PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway inhibited bystander-activated memory T cell responses but also protected cells from AICD."

        "abstract": "BackgroundLesion patterns may predict prognosis after acute ischemic stroke within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory; yet it remains unclear whether such imaging prognostic factors are related to patient outcome after intravenous thrombolysis.AimsThe aim of this study is to investigate the clinical outcome after intravenous thrombolysis in acute MCA ischemic strokes with respect to diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion patterns.MethodsConsecutive acute ischemic stroke cases of the MCA territory treated over a 7-year period were retrospectively analyzed. All acute MCA stroke patients underwent a MRI scan before intravenous thrombolytic therapy was included. DWI lesions were divided into 6 patterns (territorial, other cortical, small superficial, internal border zone, small deep, and other deep infarcts). Lesion volumes were measured by dedicated imaging processing software. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 0-2 at 90 days.ResultsAmong the 172 patients included in our study, 75 (43.6%) were observed to have territorial infarct patterns or other deep infarct patterns. These patients also had higher baseline NIHSS score (p < 0.001), a higher proportion of large cerebral artery occlusions (p < 0.001) and larger infarct volume (p < 0.001). Favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 89 patients (51.7%). After multivariable analysis, groups with specific lesion patterns, including territorial infarct and other deep infarct pattern, were independently associated with favorable outcome (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.16-0.99; p = 0.047).ConclusionsSpecific lesion patterns predict differential outcome after intravenous thrombolysis therapy in acute MCA stroke patients."

A variety of optical techniques have been developed for the characterization of mechanical motion in MEMS devices. A variety of optical metrology instruments are available to perform these measurements. Cameras based on array photodetectors are low-cost and easy to integrate with computer-based image acquisition and analysis software. High-speed cameras with frame-rates exceeding 10. 000 frames per second are available, it is desirable to measure device motion at frequencies far above this range. Higher precision can be obtained through stroboscopic measurements in which the sample is illuminated with a pulsed light source. Out-of-plane motion in MEMS is conveniently measured using an interferometer. The reflected light beams combine and interfere at the surface of the photodetector or camera. The device topography can be extracted using phase-shifting interferometry (PSI), in which a sequence of interferograms is collected while controlled variations in the relative phase of the measurement and reference path are introduced. The interferograms are then analyzed together to compute the topography of the device under test. Interferometers may also be constructed using optical fiber. The fiber FPI has a number of advantages over free-space interferometers. The fiber FPI is considerably more robust to vibration than a conventional Michelson interferometer. In an interferometer, the coherence length of the light source determines the optical path difference at which the fringe contrast falls to zero. The interferometers described above are based on the interference of laser light with the same wavelength and are classified as homodyne interferometers. One popular heterodyne interferometer is known as a laser Doppler vibrometer."

We show that this system, which we call the Doublets net, constitutes a complex body of linguistic knowledge concerning English word structure that has computable multiscale features. Distributed morphological, phonological and orthographic constraints and the language's local redundancy are seen at the node level. Phonological communities are seen at the network level. And a balancing act between the language's global efficiency and redundancy is seen at the system level. We develop a new measure of intrinsic node-to-node distance and a computational algorithm, called community geometry, which reveal the implicit multiscale structure within binary networks. Because the Doublets net is a modular complex cognitive system, the community geometry and computable multi-scale structural information may provide a foundation for understanding computational learning in many systems whose network structure has yet to be fully analyzed."

This chapter first considers methodological issues in the use of ERPs to study memory and suggests how the ERP method can be used optimally to address psychologically relevant questions. Next, it presents a selective overview of the contributions of ERP research to the study of human long-term memory, focusing specifically on episodic memory retrieval, which supports memory for personally experienced events."

        "abstract": "When acute stress is experienced immediately after memory encoding (i.e., post-encoding stress) it can significantly impact subsequent memory for that event. For example, recent work has suggested that post-encoding stress occurring in a different context from encoding impairs memory. However, the neural processes underlying these effects are poorly understood. We aimed to expand this understanding by conducting an analysis of resting functional connectivity in the period following post-encoding stress that occurred in a different context than encoding, using seed regions in the medial temporal lobes known for their roles in memory. In the current study of 44 males randomized to stress (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203023) or control (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203021) groups, we found that stress increased cortisol, impaired recollection of neutral materials, and altered functional connectivity with medial temporal lobe regions. Although stress did not significantly alter hippocampus-amygdala functional connectivity, relative to participants in the control group, participants in the post-encoding stress group showed lower functional connectivity between the hippocampus and a region with a peak in the superior temporal gyrus. Across participants in both groups, functional connectivity between these regions was related to greater increases in cortisol, and it was also inversely related to recollection of neutral materials. In contrast, the stress group showed greater parahippocampal cortex functional connectivity with a region in the left middle temporal gyrus than the control group. Moreover, greater functional connectivity between the parahippocampal cortex and the observed cluster in the middle temporal gyrus was associated with greater cortisol changes from pre- to post-manipulation, but was not related to differences in memory. The results show that post-encoding stress can alter the resting-state functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and neocortex, which may help explain how stress impacts memory."

In social-personality psychology, as well as psychology more generally, there is little guidance for how to deal with sibling constructs, which can result in researchers ignoring or mishandling them. In this article, we start by situating sibling constructs in the literature on the jingle-jangle fallacies. Then, we outline 10 conceptual and empirical criteria for determining the degree to which, and in what ways, constructs may share a sibling relationship, using self-esteem and grandiose narcissism as a running example. Finally, we discuss strategies for handling sibling constructs in a systematic and transparent way. We hope that the procedures described here will help social-personality psychologists identify sibling constructs, understand when and why they pose problems for their research, and adopt strategies that ameliorate their adverse effects."

The key enzyme in the system is a computationally designed glucose dehydrogenase with a 107-fold cofactor specificity switch toward NMN+ over NADP+ based on apparent enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that this system can be used to support diverse redox chemistries in vitro with high total turnover number (~39,000), to channel reducing power in Escherichia coli whole cells specifically from glucose to a pharmaceutical intermediate, levodione, and to sustain the high metabolic flux required for the central carbon metabolism to support growth. Overall, this work demonstrates efficient use of a noncanonical cofactor in biocatalysis and metabolic pathway design."

        "abstract": "Behavior and organization of social groups is thought to be vital to the functioning of societies, yet the contributions of various roles within social groups toward population growth and dynamics have been difficult to quantify. A common approach to quantifying these role-based contributions is evaluating the number of individuals conducting certain roles, which ignores how behavior might scale up to effects at the population-level. Manipulative experiments are another common approach to determine population-level effects, but they often ignore potential feedbacks associated with these various roles.Here, we evaluate the effects of worker size distribution in bumblebee colonies on worker production in 24 observational colonies across three environments, using functional linear models. Functional linear models are an underused correlative technique that has been used to assess lag effects of environmental drivers on plant performance. We demonstrate potential applications of this technique for exploring high-dimensional ecological systems, such as the contributions of individuals with different traits to colony dynamics.We found that more larger workers had mostly positive effects and more smaller workers had negative effects on worker production. Most of these effects were only detected under low or fluctuating resource environments suggesting that the advantage of colonies with larger-bodied workers becomes more apparent under stressful conditions.We also demonstrate the wider ecological application of functional linear models. We highlight the advantages and limitations when considering these models, and how they are a valuable complement to many of these performance-based and manipulative experiments."

        "abstract": "The spectral energy gap is an important signature that defines states of quantum matter: insulators, density waves and superconductors have very different gap structures. The momentum-resolved nature of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) makes it a powerful tool to characterize spectral gaps. ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic d-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transitionerature (T c ) cuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous gap above T c , often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy. The nature of this poorly understood pseudogap and its relationship with superconductivity has since become the focal point of research in the field. To address this issue, the momentum, temperature, doping and materials dependence of spectral gaps have been extensively examined with significantly improved instrumentation and carefully matched experiments in recent years. This article overviews the current understanding and unresolved issues of the basic phenomenology of gap hierarchy. We show how ARPES has been sensitive to phase transitions, has distinguished between orders having distinct broken electronic symmetries, and has uncovered rich momentum- and temperature-dependent fingerprints reflecting an intertwined and competing relationship between the ordered states and superconductivity that results in multiple phenomenologically distinct ground states inside the superconducting dome. These results provide us with microscopic insights into the cuprate phase diagram. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved."

Here, we demonstrate two nonmonotonic changes in the electronic structure of WTe2 upon in situ electron doping. The first phase transition is interpreted in terms of a shear displacement of the top WTe2 layer, which realizes a local crystal structure not normally found in bulk WTe2. The second phase transition is associated with stronger interactions between the dopant atoms and the host, both through hybridization and electric field. These results demonstrate that electron doping can drive structural and electronics changes in bulk WTe2 with implications for realizing nontrivial band-structure changes in heterointerfaces and devices."

FDX1 is involved in biogenesis of steroids and bile acids, Vitamin A/D metabolism, and lipoylation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes. FDX1 has been extensively characterized biochemically but its role in physiology and lipid metabolism has not been explored. In this study, we generated Fdx1-deficient mice and showed that knockout of both alleles of the Fdx1 gene led to embryonic lethality. We also showed that like Fdxr+/-+/-, Fdx1+/-+/- had a shorter life span and were prone to steatohepatitis. However, unlike Fdxr+/-+/-, Fdx1+/-+/- were not prone to spontaneous tumors. Additionally, we showed that FDX1 deficiency led to lipid droplet accumulation possibly via the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathway. Specifically, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 deficiency led to alterations in several classes of lipids, including cholesterol, triacylglycerides, acylcarnitines, ceramides, phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Taken together, our data indicate that FDX1 is essential for mammalian embryonic development and lipid homeostasis at both cellular and organismal levels."

        "abstract": "Giardia duodenalis (syn. G. intestinalis, G. lamblia) is a widespread gastrointestinal protozoan parasite with debated taxonomic status. Currently, eight distinct genetic sub-groups, termed assemblages A-H, are defined based on a few genetic markers. Assemblages A and B may represent distinct species and are both of human public health relevance. Genomic studies are scarce and the few reference genomes available, in particular for assemblage B, are insufficient for adequate comparative genomics. Here, by combining long- and short-read sequences generated by PacBio and Illumina sequencing technologies, we provide nine annotated genome sequences for reference from new clinical isolates (four assemblage A and five assemblage B parasite isolates). Isolates chosen represent the currently accepted classification of sub-assemblages AI, AII, BIII and BIV. Synteny over the whole genome was generally high, but we report chromosome-level translocations as a feature that distinguishes assemblage A from B parasites. Orthologue gene group analysis was used to define gene content differences between assemblage A and B and to contribute a gene-set-based operational definition of respective taxonomic units. Giardia is tetraploid, and high allelic sequence heterogeneity (ASH) for assemblage B vs. assemblage A has been observed so far. Noteworthy, here we report an extremely low ASH (0.002%) for one of the assemblage B isolates (a value even lower than the reference assemblage A isolate WB-C6). This challenges the view of low ASH being a notable feature that distinguishes assemblage A from B parasites, and low ASH allowed assembly of the most contiguous assemblage B genome currently available for reference. In conclusion, the description of nine highly contiguous genome assemblies of new isolates of G. duodenalis assemblage A and B adds to our understanding of the genomics and species population structure of this widespread zoonotic parasite."

A recently postulated multi-population model was used to fit the transient pump-dump-probe and dump-induced depletion signals. We observed dump-induced depletion of the Lumi-R photoproduct, demonstrating that photoisomerization occurs via evolution on both the excited- and ground-state electronic surfaces. Excited-state equilibrium was not observed, as shown via the absence of a dump-induced excited-state \"Le Ch\u00c3\u00a2telier redistribution\" of excited-state populations.

Canonical phytochromes include master regulators of plant growth and development in which light signals trigger interconversion between a red-absorbing 15Z dark-adapted state and a metastable, far-red-absorbing 15E photoproduct state. Distantly related cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) carry out a diverse range of photoregulatory functions in cyanobacteria and exhibit considerable spectral diversity. One widespread CBCR subfamily typically exhibits a red-absorbing 15Z dark-adapted state similar to that of phytochrome that gives rise to a distinct green-absorbing 15E photoproduct. This red/green CBCR subfamily also includes red-inactive examples that fail to undergo photoconversion, providing an opportunity to study protein-chromophore interactions that either promote photoisomerization or block it. In this work, we identified a conserved lineage of red-inactive CBCRs. This enabled us to identify three substitutions sufficient to block photoisomerization in photoactive red/green CBCRs. The resulting red-inactive variants faithfully replicated the fluorescence and circular dichroism properties of naturally occurring examples. Converse substitutions restored photoconversion in naturally red-inactive CBCRs. This work thus identifies protein-chromophore interactions that control the fate of the excited-state population in red/green cyanobacteriochromes."

Data are typically collected at a single point in time. Biological processes on the other hand are often non-linear and display time varying dynamics. The extent to which graphical models can recapitulate the architecture of an underlying biological processes is not well understood. We consider metabolic networks with known stoichiometry to address the fundamental question: \"What can causal networks tell us about metabolic pathways?\". Using data from an Arabidopsis Bay[Formula: see text]Sha population and simulated data from dynamic models of pathway motifs, we assess our ability to reconstruct metabolic pathways using graphical models. Our results highlight the necessity of non-genetic residual biological variation for reliable inference. Recovery of the ordering within a pathway is possible, but should not be expected. Causal inference is sensitive to subtle patterns in the correlation structure that may be driven by a variety of factors, which may not emphasize the substrate-product relationship. We illustrate the effects of metabolic pathway architecture, epistasis and stochastic variation on correlation structure and graphical model-derived networks. We conclude that graphical models should be interpreted cautiously, especially if the implied causal relationships are to be used in the design of intervention strategies."

This theory posits that epigenetic marks can control adaptive phenotypes but the relative potential of epigenetic variation in comparison to genetic variation in these traits is not presently understood. To compare the potential of epigenetic and genetic variation in adaptive traits, we analyzed the influence of DNA methylation variation on the accumulation of chemical defense compounds glucosinolates from the order Brassicales. Several decades of work on glucosinolates has generated extensive knowledge about their synthesis, regulation, genetic variation and contribution to fitness establishing this pathway as a model pathway for complex adaptive traits. Using high-throughput phenotyping with a randomized block design of ddm1 derived Arabidopsis thaliana epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines, we measured the correlation between DNA methylation variation and mean glucosinolate variation and within line stochastic variation. Using this information, we identified epigenetic Quantitative Trait Loci that contained specific Differentially Methylated Regions associated with glucosinolate traits. This showed that variation in DNA methylation correlates both with levels and variance of glucosinolates and flowering time with trait-specific loci. By conducting a meta-analysis comparing the results to different genetically variable populations, we conclude that the influence of DNA methylation variation on these adaptive traits is much lower than the corresponding impact of standing genetic variation. As such, selective pressure on these traits should mainly affect standing genetic variation to lead to adaptation."

As part of a multicenter. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of F in sickle cell patients (SCD) with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). 73 children aged 9 to 15 yr, were enrolled (37 F; 36 P). In the trial, study medication was given as a continuous IV infusion with either F (150 mg/ ml) at 100 mg/kg x 1 hr plus 30 mg/kg/hr x 47 hr, or matching placebo (P). In the 1 endpoint of the study, length of crisis (LOC), the children showed a reduction in LOC when treated with F vs. P (127 hr vs. 148.6 h, p=0.010). In addition, the F-patients exhibited a 114% increase in the number who achieved crisis resolution within 168 hr (59.5% vs. 27.8%, p=0.009). The F-patients also showed decreases in duration of hospitalization, pain intensity and total analgesic use, but these were not statistically significant. In addition, the incidence of AEs judged by investigators as acute chest syndrome or pneumonia were reduced by 42% (4 vs. 7) and 60% (2 vs. 5), respectively, in the Fpatients. F was generally well tolerated during the study but in some patients LFTs were transiently elevated with return to baseline during the hospitalization period. F had a slightly higher incidence of LFT elevations than P (14% vs 11%). No clinically significant renal function abnormalities were observed. Mild, transient thrombocytopenia was observed in 27% of F-pediatric patients vs. 22% on P. In a related study SCD patients with VOC were enrolled in an open-label, repeat administration safety study using the same dosing regimen as described above. The study enrolled 28 patients aged 7 to 39 yr, with 11 patients aged 7 to 15 yr. These 11 patients had 26 exposures to treatment, with 4 patients having 3 or more treatments within 1 yr. Only one of the p\u00c3\u00a9diatrie patients experienced an SAE, fever and sepsis, and it was judged unrelated to F. There was no obvious increase in the incidence of hepatic, renal or platelet abnormalities with repeat treatment with F. Overall, F was effective and well tolerated when administered by continuous IV infusion to p\u00c3\u00a9diatrie SCD patients. We feel these data justify conduct of a definitive study to validate the benefit of F in p\u00c3\u00a9diatrie SCD patients experiencing VOC."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We previously demonstrated lower early mortality for young adults (YAs) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received induction treatment at specialized cancer centers (SCCs) versus community hospitals. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of inpatient location of treatment throughout therapy on long-term survival, complications, and cost-associations that have not yet been evaluated at the population level. METHODS: Using the California Cancer Registry linked to a hospitalization database, we identified patients, 0-39 years of age, diagnosed with first primary ALL who received inpatient treatment between 1991 and 2014. Patients were classified as receiving all or part or none of their inpatient treatment at an SCC within 3 years of diagnosis. Inverse probability-weighted, multivariable Cox regression models estimated the associations between location of treatment and sociodemographic and clinical factors with survival. We compared 3-year inpatient costs overall and per day by age group and location of care. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent (0-18 years; n = 4,549) of children and 36% of YAs (19-39 years; n = 683) received all treatment at SCCs. Receiving all treatment at an SCC was associated with superior leukemia-specific (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.88) and overall survival (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.97) in children and in YAs (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.83; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.80) even after controlling for complications. The cost of inpatient care during the full course of therapy was higher in patients receiving all of their care at SCCs. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that inpatient treatment at an SCC throughout therapy is associated with superior survival; therefore, strong consideration should be given to referring these patients to SCCs."

We hypothesized that deficits in cognitive control contribute to these comprehension deficits during discourse processing, and investigated the underlying cognitive-neural mechanisms using EEG (alpha power) and ERPs (N400). N400 amplitudes to globally supported or unsupported target words near the end of stories were used to index sensitivity to previous context. ERPs showed reduced sensitivity to context in patients versus controls. EEG alpha-band activity was used to index attentional engagement while participants listened to the stories. We found that context effects varied with attentional engagement in both groups, as well as with negative symptom severity in patients. Both groups demonstrated trial-to-trial fluctuations in alpha. Relatively high alpha power was associated with compromised discourse processing in participants with schizophrenia when it occurred during any early portion of the story. In contrast, discourse processing was only compromised in controls when alpha was relatively high for longer segments of the stories. Our results indicate that shifts in attention from the story context may be more detrimental to discourse processing for participants with schizophrenia than for controls, most likely due to an impaired ability to benefit from global context."

All galaxies, regardless of central satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR \u00e2\u2030\u02c6 10-11yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the 'green valley'. Satellite galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched ('red sequence') side of the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses down to 3 \u00c3\u2014 1011M\u00e2\u0160\u2122 and increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc2Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they cross within \u00e2\u02c6\u00bcRvir of a more massive host halo; (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly.

We identify halo stars kinematically as moving at a relative speed of at least 220 km s-1 with respect to the local standard of rest. These stars are generally less metal-rich than the disk, but surprisingly, half of our halo sample is comprised of stars with [Fe H] >-1. The orbital directions of these metal-rich halo stars are preferentially aligned with the disk rotation, in sharp contrast with the intrinsically isotropic orbital distribution of the metal-poor halo stars. We find similar properties in the Latte cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy from the FIRE project. In Latte, metal-rich halo stars formed primarily inside of the solar circle, whereas lower-metallicity halo stars preferentially formed at larger distances (extending beyond the virial radius). This suggests that metal-rich halo stars in the solar neighborhood actually formed in situ within the Galactic disk, rather than having been accreted from satellite systems. These stars, currently on halo-like orbits, therefore have likely undergone substantial radial migration/heating."

        "abstract": "Dwarf galaxies are known to have remarkably low star formation efficiency due to strong feedback. Adopting the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) as a laboratory, we explore a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model to understand how the feedback processes shape the satellite galaxies of the MW. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we exhaustively search a large parameter space of the model and rigorously show that the general wisdom of strong outflows as the primary feedback mechanism cannot simultaneously explain the stellar mass function and the mass-metallicity relation of the MW satellites. An extended model that assumes that a fraction of baryons is prevented from collapsing into low-mass halos in the first place can be accurately constrained to simultaneously reproduce those observations. The inference suggests that two different physical mechanisms are needed to explain the two different data sets. In particular, moderate outflows with weak halo mass dependence are needed to explain the mass-metallicity relation, and prevention of baryons falling into shallow gravitational potentials of low-mass halos (e.g., \"pre-heating\") is needed to explain the low stellar mass fraction for a given subhalo mass."

Strong illness expectations may place COVID-19 essential workers at risk. It is unclear, however, whether knowledge can moderate the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations on protective behaviors. We test COVID-19 knowledge as a moderator of the effects of (1) pessimistic illness expectations and (2) essential worker status on adherence to protective behaviors. Methods: Participants (n = 350) completed measures of knowledge, illness expectations, and protective behaviors. We used chi-square tests to examine associations between variables and logistic regressions to test the moderation models predicting adherence (low, high) while controlling for demographics. Results: Knowledge, illness expectations, and adherence were significantly associated with each other (p < 0.05). Essential workers had stronger illness expectations and lower knowledge than did non-essential workers (p < 0.001). Logistic regressions showed a non-significant Worker Status \u00c3\u2014 Knowledge interaction (p = 0.59) but a significant Knowledge \u00c3\u2014 Illness Expectations interaction (p < 0.05) indicating that those with strong illness expectations and low knowledge were disproportionately at risk of failing to adhere to recommended behaviors. Conclusions: Knowledge promotes protective behaviors by buffering the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations. Essential workers are more likely to have low levels of knowledge with strong illness expectations, suggesting that educational policies may be warranted."

Monitoring the differential photoelectron spectra as a function of time delay allowed us to obtain the relaxation lifetimes of these Rydberg states.

        "abstract": "Caltrans is in the process of implementing Mechanistic-Empirical design procedures. All mechanisticempirical methods must be validated/calibrated against the behavior of real pavements. This should be done before implementing models in design methods to ensure that designs will be reasonable. The Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) provides a first step in this validation/calibration process. The short test section can be carefully constructed with well characterized materials and instrumented to measure the pavement response. The climatic conditions may be controlled or monitored closely and all load applications are known exactly. The pavement may also be tested until it fails. The HVS may be seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large scale\u00e2\u20ac\u009d laboratory equipment, between the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small scale\u00e2\u20ac\u009d laboratory equipment (triaxial tests, bending tests etc.) and the reality of real pavements, which have uncertainties regarding materials, loads and climatic conditions. The two HVSs owned by Caltrans have been used on 27 flexible pavement test sections, with varying combinations of asphalt and granular layers. Temperature control was used during the tests. Most sections have been instrumented with Multi-depth Deflectometers (MDDs) to compare the measured pavement deflections (at several depths) to the deflections predicted by mechanistic methods, during the full duration of tests carried to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failure\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (in terms of rutting or cracking). Results from mechanistic models have been compared with the deflection measurements and performance as a first step prior to empirical calibrations with field results. The complete time history of each test has been compared rather than just the beginning and end measurements. This report presents the validation of the mechanistic models for asphalt fatigue and for permanent deformation with the HVS test results."

The study included a literature review, field testing of existing projects and test sections, estimation of the effective stiffness of each layer in permeable interlocking concrete pavement structures, mechanistic analysis and structural design of a test track incorporating three different subbase thicknesses (low, medium, and higher risk), tests on the track with a Heavy Vehicle Simulator to collect performance data to validate the design approach using accelerated loading, refinement and calibration of the design procedure using the test track data, development of a spreadsheet based design tool, and development of revised design tables using the design tool. A new example design table, based on the number of days with standing water in the subbase (zero, 10, 30, 50, 90, and 120) has been developed. The table uses a similar format to that currently used in the ICPI Permeable Interlocking Concrete Pavements guideline. The minimum design thicknesses required to prevent subgrade rutting that are proposed in the new table do not differ significantly from those in the current ICPI guide, and are mostly less conservative. Designs for a specific set of project circumstances can be undertaken using the same Excel\u00c2\u00ae spreadsheet-based design tool used to develop the tables in conjunction with the hydrological design procedures provided in the ICPI guide."

        "abstract": "In this research, field slab samples were taken from an asphalt pavement in a hot climate with a design life of 40\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years at 2, 4, and 7\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years of pavement age to determine aging behavior with time at different depths. The asphalt binders were extracted and recovered to evaluate the aging and fatigue performance of the intermediate layer of the asphalt pavement. The chemical and rheological aging properties of the binders were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and a dynamic shear rheometer, respectively. The pavement included 25\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm (1\u00e2\u20ac\u2030in.) open-graded and 75\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm (2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030in.) polymer-modified layers over three intermediate layer lifts. The intermediate layer aging is mostly governed by the connecting air voids and binder content of the asphalt mixes. The variation in aging deeper than 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm (4\u00e2\u20ac\u2030in.) below the pavement surface was minor because of the absence of heat and access to air, with similar aging parameter values observed for different years of field sampling indicating little to no aging after construction. A good correlation ( R2 values of 0.79\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.92) was observed between the chemical property (carbonyl index) and rheological properties of the extracted binder for the dense-graded asphalt concrete layers between 25 and 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm depths. The fatigue performance of these extracted binders was evaluated by performing linear amplitude sweep tests. The results indicate that binder fatigue performance initially improved with moderate levels of aging but started to decline under extreme aging conditions."

        "abstract": "Effectors are microbial-derived secreted proteins with an essential function in modulating host immunity during infections. CfAvr4, an effector protein from the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum and the founding member of a fungal effector family, promotes parasitism through binding fungal chitin and protecting it from chitinases. Binding of Avr4 to chitin is mediated by a carbohydrate-binding module of family 14 (CBM14), an abundant CBM across all domains of life. To date, the structural basis of chitin-binding by Avr4 effector proteins and of recognition by the cognate Cf-4 plant immune receptor are still poorly understood. Using X-ray crystallography, we solved the crystal structure of CfAvr4 in complex with chitohexaose [(GlcNAc)6] at 1.95\u00c3\u2026 resolution. This is the first co-crystal structure of a CBM14 protein together with its ligand that further reveals the molecular mechanism of (GlcNAc)6 binding by Avr4 effector proteins and CBM14 family members in general. The structure showed that two molecules of CfAvr4 interact through the ligand and form a three-dimensional molecular sandwich that encapsulates two (GlcNAc)6 molecules within the dimeric assembly. Contrary to previous assumptions made with other CBM14 members, the chitohexaose-binding domain (ChBD) extends to the entire length of CfAvr4 with the reducing end of (GlcNAc)6 positioned near the N-terminus and the non-reducing end at the C-terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues interacting with (GlcNAc)6 enabled the elucidation of the precise topography and amino acid composition of Avr4's ChBD and further showed that these residues do not individually mediate the recognition of CfAvr4 by the Cf-4 immune receptor. Instead, the studies highlighted the dependency of Cf-4-mediated recognition on CfAvr4's stability and resistance against proteolysis in the leaf apoplast, and provided the evidence for structurally separating intrinsic function from immune receptor recognition in this effector family."

We demonstrate how this approach can be applied to examine associations between multiple time-varying exposures and subsequent health outcomes, where the former are recorded sparsely and irregularly in time, with emphasis on the utility of multiple longitudinal observations in the framework of dimension reduction techniques. In applications to children's growth data, we investigate archetypes of infant growth patterns and identify subgroups that are related to cognitive development in childhood. Specifically, \"Stunting\" and \"Faltering\" time-dynamic patterns of head circumference, body length and weight in the first 12 months are associated with lower levels of long-term cognitive development in comparison to \"Generally Large\" and \"Catch-up\" growth. Our findings provide evidence for the statistical association between multivariate growth patterns in infancy and long-term cognitive development."

Such FMEMs consist of fixed effects that characterize the association between longitudinal functional responses and covariates of interest and random effects that capture the spatial-temporal correlations of longitudinal functional responses. We propose local linear estimates of refined fixed effect functions and establish their weak convergence along with a simultaneous confidence band for each fixed-effect function. We propose a global test for the linear hypotheses of varying coefficient functions and derive the associated asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis and the asymptotic power under the alternative hypothesis are derived. We also establish the convergence rates of the estimated spatial-temporal covariance operators and their associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We conduct extensive simulations and apply our method to a white-matter fiber data set from a national database for autism research to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimation and inference procedures."

We also propose a method for forecasting case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model.

Proximal lower extremity musculature (particularly the hip and knee extensors), ankle dorsiflexors, and neck flexors showed significant early weakness. Extensor muscle groups were weaker than flexor muscles at the elbow and knee. The mean manual muscle test (MMT) strength grade for all muscle groups combined was 3.7 \u00c2\u00b1 0.8 MMT units. There was a slowly progressive decline in strength, only -0.31 MMT units per decade, and the decline was relatively equal in all muscle groups. There was not side dominance. Severe contractures did not appear to be a problem until after transition to a wheelchair, and scoliosis was rare. Restrictive lung disease occurred as a late complication in a small percentage of cases; however, maximal expiratory pressure was significantly reduced early in the disease. Only two individuals (19%) had severe restrictive lung disease and a history of significant respiratory complications. There was a slight but significant decline in forced vital capacity and maximal expiratory pressure with age and disease duration. The cardiomyopathy in BMD appeared to be disproportionately severe in some cases. Eleven individuals (73%) had abnormal electrocardiograms, and five (25%) had a history of significant cardiovascular complication, with no age or disease duration effect. Functional evaluations and timed motor performance tests showed only mild disability in most individuals. Mean intellectual and neuropsychologic function was within normal limits, but with a large variability in intelligence quotient scores. This report and others suggest a tremendous heterogeneity of severity among males with BMD."

Here we identify circulating miRNAs and proteins that are dysregulated in early-onset FSHD patients to develop blood-based molecular biomarkers. Plasma samples from clinically characterized individuals with early-onset FSHD provide a discovery group and are compared to healthy control volunteers. Low-density quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based arrays identify 19 candidate miRNAs, while mass spectrometry proteomic analysis identifies 13 candidate proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data shows that the FSHD-dysregulated DUX4 transcription factor binds to regulatory regions of several candidate miRNAs. This panel of miRNAs also shows ChIP signatures consistent with regulation by additional transcription factors which are up-regulated in FSHD (FOS, EGR1, MYC, and YY1). Validation studies in a separate group of patients with FSHD show consistent up-regulation of miR-100, miR-103, miR-146b, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-454, miR-505, and miR-576. An increase in the expression of S100A8 protein, an inflammatory regulatory factor and subunit of calprotectin, is validated by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Bioinformatic analyses of proteomics and miRNA data further support a model of calprotectin and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway dysregulation in FSHD. Moving forward, this panel of miRNAs, along with S100A8 and calprotectin, merit further investigation as monitoring and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for FSHD."

        "abstract": "There are several methods of improving the damage tolerance life of metals commonly used on rotorcraft. These methods have been used conservatively without adequate practical, reliable and validated analytical methods for fracture mechanics analyses to account for the complete benefits. This program examined one life improvement method (cold working) on open-hole specimens, loaded-hole specimens, and component level specimens of aluminum structures. The improved integrated analysis procedure will be compared with baseline damage tolerance analyses. The improved procedure shows a more precise and longer predicted life and hence fewer inspections during the life of the aircraft. In order to account for the residual stresses created by cold working, a closed form solution using plasticity methods was used along with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) analysis. The results from the closed form solution are integrated with finite element stress analysis that provides input to a crack growth analysis, which therefore accounts for the cold working. The results of the analysis procedure are presented and compared with representative specimen testing. The three different geometries were modeled and tested. Open hole testing was performed for two thicknesses (.08\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3 and .19\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3), including both bare and clad 7075-T6 aluminum alloy sheet. A loaded hole test was also performed at the same thicknesses for bare and clad 7075-T6 aluminum alloy sheet. A nested angle test was run as a representative structural detail. The parts were cold worked and reamed to the maximum size based on specifications. The tests were performed to validate methods of accounting for residual stresses arising from cold working the holes.

The forging process involves a number of steps required to attain favorable material properties (e.g., heat treatment, rapid quench, cold work stress relieving, and artificial aging). These processing steps, however, also result in the introduction of bulk residual stress. Excessive bulk residual stresses can have negative consequences including: part distortion during machining and/or during service, reduced crack initiation life, increased crack growth rates, and an overall reduction in part life. This presentation will summarize recent work related to quantifying and accounting for residual stress in aluminum die forgings. Key residual stress engineering concepts will be described. Since the artifacts studied are associated with an aircraft supply chain (multiple parts and multiple lots), the results are relevant to the aerospace community. Overall, the results show that forging residual stress is a repeatable phenomenon with approximate repeatability less than 5% of A-basis yield strength."

Organoid viability of patient-derived xenografts was measured after knocking down ARHGEF2.ResultsWe identify a 95-gene NLS representing the molecular landscape of neural precursor cell proliferation, embryonic stem cell pluripotency, and neural stem cell differentiation, which may indicate an early or intermediate stage of neuroendocrine differentiation. These NLS genes positively correlate with conventional neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin and synaptophysin, and negatively correlate with AR and AR target genes in advanced prostate cancer. Differentially expressed NLS genes stratify small-cell NEPC from prostate adenocarcinoma, which are closely associated with clinicopathologic features such as Gleason Score and metastasis status. Higher ARGHEF2, LHX2, and EPHB2 levels among the 95 NLS genes correlate with a shortened survival time in NEPC patients. Furthermore, downregulation of ARHGEF2 gene expression suppresses cell viability and markers of neuroendocrine differentiation in enzalutamide-resistant and neuroendocrine cells.ConclusionsThe 95 neural lineage gene signatures capture an early molecular shift toward neuroendocrine differentiation, which could stratify advanced prostate cancer patients to optimize clinical treatment and serve as a source of potential therapeutic targets in advanced prostate cancer."

        "abstract": "ObjectiveThe pathophysiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remains undetermined. Seizures are accompanied by respiratory dysfunction (RD). Postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES) may follow generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Following GTCS patients have impaired arousal and may be motionless. Patients with SUDEP are usually prone. Postictal immobility (PI) may contribute to SUDEP by not permitting repositioning of the head to allow unimpeded ventilation. To determine whether RD and/or ictal characteristics are associated with PI, we analyzed patients with GTCS in the epilepsy monitoring unit.MethodWe investigated for associations between PI duration and PGES, ictal/postictal oxygen saturation (SpO2 ), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2 ), seizure localization, duration, and tonic and total convulsive phase duration. We investigated for linkage between PGES and these measures.ResultsSeventy patients with 181 GTCS and available SpO2 and/or ETCO2 data were studied. Simple linear regression analysis by seizures showed that PI duration was associated with peak periictal ETCO2 (p = 0.03), duration of oxygen desaturation (p = 0.005) and with SpO2 nadir (p = 0.02). PI duration was not associated with tonic, convulsive phase or total seizure duration. Analysis by patients also showed significant association of PI with RD. Duration of PI was longer following seizures with PGES (p < 0.001). PGES was not associated with the tonic, convulsive phase or total seizure duration. SpO2 nadir was lower in seizures with PGES (p = 0.046), ETCO2 peak change (p = 0.003) was higher, and duration of ETCO2 elevation (p = 0.03) was longer. Multivariable regression analysis showed that PGES and severe RD were associated with PI duration.SignificanceThe duration of PI and presence of PGES are associated with periictal RD. The duration of PI is also associated with the presence of PGES. Seizure duration or duration of the convulsive phase is not associated with PI or PGES. Interventions aimed at reversing impaired arousal and PI may reduce SUDEP risk."

The system requirements and specifications for the device development are presented and discussed. In addition, the detailed architecture, hardware, software, and user interface design are included. Vehicular and personal GPS-ATD systems were developed to support comprehensive traveler behavior studies. The GPS-ATD provides an intuitive user interface to capture trip activity information (trip purpose, travel mode, etc.), with minimal user input and burden during travel surveys. Each survey participant interacts with their own personal GPS-ATD, and information is automatically coordinated between personal and vehicular GPS-ATD units via' ZigBee wireless. The system captures and logs data from the High-Sensitivity GPS (HSGPS) receiver, allowing subsequent identification of corridors, route lengths, and regional and inter-regional trips. The primary sensor is the HSGPS receiver. For the vehicular GPS-ATD, inertial sensing (MEMS gyro and accelerometers) is also provided to fill in the gaps during GPS outages and cold starts. To obtain vehicle sensor information, the GPS-ATD uses ZigBee wireless communications to the car computer On-Board Diagnostics connector (OBD-II). Following the design discussion, complete system testing and results are presented. The paper concludes with recommendations for future work related to the GPS-ATD and its use in the 2010 California Statewide Household Travel Survey."

This paper presents a hierarchical and decentralized approach for integrated damage assessment and trajectory re-planning in aircraft with uncertainties in navigational decision-making. Aircraft navigation can be safely accomplished by properly addressing the following: decision-making, obstacle perception, aircraft state estimation, and aircraft control. When inflight failures or damage occur resulting in an emergency, rapid and precise decision-making under imprecise information is required in order to regain and maintain control of the aircraft. In order to fly the pre-planned aircraft trajectory and complete safe landing, the uncertainties in system dynamics of the damaged aircraft need to be estimated and incorporated at the level of motion replanning. The damaged aircraft is simulated via a simplified kinematic model. The different sources and perspectives of uncertainties in the damage assessment process and post-failure trajectory re-planning are presented. The decision-making process is developed via the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The objective of the trajectory replanning is to arrive at a target position while maximizing the safety of the aircraft given uncertain conditions. Simulations are presented for an emergency motion planning and landing that takes into account aircraft dynamics, path complexity, distance to landing site, runway characteristics, and subjective human decision."

        "abstract": "An Analytical Skip Entry Guidance (ASEG) algorithm is developed and simulated for a low L/D spacecraft. Formulation is based on an adaptation of the analytical theory developed for the Shuttle Entry Guidance (SEG). The validation study showed that, the SEG assumption of the flight path angle to be zero is not applicable. More accurate reference altitude rate profile and range prediction were developed when the flight path angle was assumed to be nonzero. In addition, the scale height formulation was modified for the first segment of the 1st entry phase in order to complete the development of a valid reference altitude rate profile. Given these modifications, a baseline ASEG algorithm was integrated with the Simulation of Rocket Trajectories Program and full simulations were completed. The baseline simulation revealed that the ASEG reference L/D developed for segment 1, did not provide a correct bank command profile to achieve a skip trajectory. Thus, a constant L/D was implemented for the first segment of the 1st entry phase and the baseline simulation was established, range targeting technique was implemented in the ASEG algorithm and flight simulations were completed using SORT. The ASEG algorithm and range targeting are applied after entry interface when the drag acceleration is approximately 0.2g's and terminates targeting as the vehicle approaches 0.2g's towards exit. The results show that the ranging technique commanded the vehicle to fly a total range that was within 3.2% of the nominal projected total range. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2008 by the authors."

The design example is a high aspect ratio articulated flexible blade with a thin-walled multicell cross section at high tip Mach numbers. The rotor blade analysis sets consist of three subsets; the first subset is an elastic analysis for stress prediction using idealized model, the second subset is a dynamic analysis for optimal natural frequency placement and vibratory vertical hub shear reduction using finite element method, and third subset is a dynamic aeroelastic analysis for accurate instability boundary prediction using Rayleigh-Ritz method. In the first subset, the discretization of the blade using chordwise segments and spanwise elements procedure introduced in this paper allows systematic evaluation of not only the blade cross sectional properties but also the axial stresses and shear flows on all chordwise segments of all spanwise elements. Therefore, this approach provides efficient material reassignment for minimum weight design. The optimization procedure is decomposed into two levels for more efficient handling of the design variables and objective functions, and their correlation. The optimization results show the efficiency of the method developed in this paper, the effects of tuning masses and their locations on the hub shear reduction, and the effects of using isotropic versus composite materials in design."

The 2 methods have not been compared with canine blood.ObjectivesThe aims of the study were to compare the PLT, WBC, and RBC concentrations, in vitro PLT function, and markers of platelet storage lesion (PSL) in canine PC generated by 2 different protocols, and determine microbial growth throughout storage.MethodsPC from 8 healthy donor dogs were produced using 2 standard protocols, PRP and BC. PLT, WBC, and RBC counts, optical aggregometry assays, and PSL markers (pH, pCO2 , HCO3 , lactate and glucose concentrations, and LDH activity) were determined on storage days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were also performed.ResultsMean PLT counts were comparable between protocols and remained stable throughout storage up to day 7, while median WBC and RBC counts on day 0 were significantly higher in the BC-PC group (17,800&nbsp;WBCs/\u00ce\u00bcL; 195,000&nbsp;RBCs/\u00ce\u00bcL) than in the PRP-PC group (200&nbsp;WBCs/\u00ce\u00bcL; 10,000&nbsp;RBCs/\u00ce\u00bcL) (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.012). In PRP-PC aggregometry, the median slope and amplitude in response to \u00ce\u00b3-thrombin and convulxin (+ ADP) were significantly decreased, and virtually absent in BC-PC during storage. PSL markers (lactate, LDH activity) were higher in BC-PC. Aerobic bacterial growth was observed in 2 PRP-PC and 1 BC-PC.ConclusionsThis in vitro study suggests that PRP-PC had lesser WBC and RBC contamination and superior PLT function compared with BC-PC.

        "abstract": "Physically salient objects are thought to attract attention in natural scenes. However, research has shown that meaning maps, which capture the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene features, trump physical saliency in predicting the pattern of eye moments in natural scene viewing. Meaning maps even predict the fastest eye movements, suggesting that the brain extracts the spatial distribution of potentially meaningful scene regions very rapidly. To test this hypothesis, we applied representational similarity analysis to ERP data. The ERPs were obtained from human participants (N = 32, male and female) who viewed a series of 50 different natural scenes while performing a modified 1-back task. For each scene, we obtained a physical saliency map from a computational model and a meaning map from crowd-sourced ratings. We then used representational similarity analysis to assess the extent to which the representational geometry of physical saliency maps and meaning maps can predict the representational geometry of the neural response (the ERP scalp distribution) at each moment in time following scene onset. We found that a link between physical saliency and the ERPs emerged first (\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc78 ms after stimulus onset), with a link to semantic informativeness emerging soon afterward (\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc87 ms after stimulus onset). These findings are in line with previous evidence indicating that saliency is computed rapidly, while also indicating that information related to the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene elements is computed shortly thereafter, early enough to potentially exert an influence on eye movements.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Attention may be attracted by physically salient objects, such as flashing lights, but humans must also be able to direct their attention to meaningful parts of scenes. Understanding how we direct attention to meaningful scene regions will be important for developing treatments for disorders of attention and for designing roadways, cockpits, and computer user interfaces. Information about saliency appears to be extracted rapidly by the brain, but little is known about the mechanisms that determine the locations of meaningful information. To address this gap, we showed people photographs of real-world scenes and measured brain activity. We found that information related to the locations of meaningful scene elements was extracted rapidly, shortly after the emergence of saliency-related information."

Altered microbiome profiles, pro-inflammatory responses and impaired intestinal permeability have been observed in children with ASD and co-morbid GI symptoms, yet few studies have compared these findings to ASD children without GI issues or similarly aged typical developing children. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are biological signatures in terms of immune dysfunction and microbiota composition in children with ASD with GI symptoms.MethodsChildren were enrolled in one of four groups: ASD and GI symptoms of irregular bowel habits (ASDGI), children with ASD but without current or previous GI symptoms (ASDNoGI), typically developing children with GI symptoms (TDGI) and typically developing children without current or previous GI symptoms (TDNoGI). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the blood, stimulated and assessed for cytokine production, while stool samples were analyzed for microbial composition.ResultsFollowing Toll-Like receptor (TLR)-4 stimulation, the ASDGI group produced increased levels of mucosa-relevant cytokines including IL-5, IL-15 and IL-17 compared to ASDNoGI. The production of the regulatory cytokine TGF\u00ce\u00b21 was decreased in the ASDGI group compared with both the ASDNoGI and TDNoGI groups. Analysis of the microbiome at the family level revealed differences in microbiome composition between ASD and TD children with GI symptoms; furthermore, a predictive metagenome functional content analysis revealed that pathways were differentially represented between ASD and TD subjects, independently of the presence of GI symptoms. The ASDGI also showed an over-representation of the gene encoding zonulin, a molecule regulating gut permeability, compared to the other groups.ConclusionsOverall our findings suggest that children with ASD who experience GI symptoms have an imbalance in their immune response, possibly influenced by or influencing metagenomic changes, and may have a propensity to impaired gut barrier function which may contribute to their symptoms and clinical outcome."

Primary care providers need culturally-informed strategies for addressing stigmatizing illnesses. Methods 11 Vietnamese American community members participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. The grounded theory approach was used for qualitative coding and thematic analysis. Results Vietnamese community members describe experiences with depression under four themes: (1) Stigma and face; (2) Social functioning and the role of the family; (3) Traditional healing and beliefs about medications; and (4) Language and culture. Based on this data, we offer suggestions for improving culturally-informed care for Vietnamese Americans. Disucssion Our study adds to the research aimed at improving communication and health care relationships between physicians and Vietnamese American patients. Physicians should learn to tailor their interviewing style to the increasingly diverse patient population."

        "abstract": "BackgroundDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) causes brain injuries in children ranging from subtle to life-threatening. Previous studies suggest that DKA-related brain injury may involve both stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport and microglial activation. Other studies implicate the Na-K-Cl cotransporter and the Ca-activated K channel KCa3.1 in activation of microglia and ischemia-induced brain edema. In this study, we determined whether inhibiting cerebral Na-K-Cl cotransport or KCa3.1 could reduce microglial activation and decrease DKA-related inflammatory changes in the brain.MethodsUsing immunohistochemistry, we investigated cellular alterations in brain specimens from juvenile rats with DKA before, during and after insulin and saline treatment. We compared findings in rats treated with and without bumetanide (an inhibitor of Na-K-Cl cotransport) or the KCa3.1 inhibitor TRAM-34.ResultsGlial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining intensity was increased in the hippocampus during DKA, suggesting reactive astrogliosis. OX42 staining intensity was increased during DKA in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum, indicating microglial activation. Treatment with TRAM-34 decreased both OX42 and GFAP intensity suggesting a decreased inflammatory response to DKA. Treatment with bumetanide did not significantly alter OX42 or GFAP intensity.ConclusionsInhibiting KCa3.1 activity with TRAM-34 during DKA treatment decreases microglial activation and reduces reactive astrogliosis, suggesting a decreased inflammatory response."

Age at presentation, BMI z-score, and gender were the variables used in logistic regression analysis to create models for T2D prediction.ResultsThe regression-based model created from African American data had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 89%; testing of a replication cohort showed 91% sensitivity and 93% specificity. A model based on the Hispanic American data showed 92% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Similarities between African American and Hispanic American patients include: (1) age at onset for both T1D and T2D decreased from the 1980s to the 2000s; (2) risk of T2D increased markedly with obesity. Racial/ethnic-specific observations included: (1) in African American patients, the proportion of females was significantly higher than that of males for T2D compared to T1D (p<0.0001); (2) in Hispanic Americans, the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was significantly higher in T1D than in T2D (p<0.002) at presentation; (3) the strongest contributor to T2D risk was female gender in African Americans, while the strongest contributor to T2D risk was BMI z-score in Hispanic Americans.ConclusionsDistinction of T2D from T1D at patient presentation was possible with good sensitivity and specificity using only three easily-assessed variables: age, gender, and BMI z-score. In African American pediatric diabetes patients, gender was the strongest predictor of T2D, while in Hispanic patients, BMI z-score was the strongest predictor. This suggests that race/ethnic specific models may be useful to optimize distinction of T1D from T2D at presentation."

We evaluated the effects of agents that reduce neuroinflammation (triarylmethane-34 (TRAM-34) and minocycline) during and after DKA in a rat model.Research design and methodsJuvenile rats with DKA were treated with insulin and saline, either alone or in combination with TRAM-34 (40\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily for 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2030days, then daily for 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2030days) or minocycline (45\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/kg intraperitoneally daily for 7\u00e2\u20ac\u2030days). We compared cytokine and chemokine concentrations in brain tissue lysates during DKA among the three treatment groups and in normal controls and diabetic controls (n=9-15/group). We also compared brain inflammatory mediator levels in these same groups in adult diabetic rats that were treated for DKA as juveniles.ResultsBrain tissue concentrations of chemokine (C-C) motif ligand (CCL)3, CCL5 and interferon (IFN\u00ce\u00b3) were increased during acute DKA, as were brain cytokine composite scores. Both treatments reduced brain inflammatory mediator levels during acute DKA. TRAM-34 predominantly reduced chemokine concentrations (chemokine (C-X-C) motif ligand (CXCL-1), CCL5) whereas minocycline had broader effects, (reducing CXCL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u00ce\u00b1), IFN\u00ce\u00b3, interleukin (IL) 2, IL-10 and IL-17A). Brain inflammatory mediator levels were elevated in adult rats that had DKA as juveniles, compared with adult diabetic rats without previous DKA, however, neither TRAM-34 nor minocycline treatment reduced these levels.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that both TRAM-34 and minocycline reduce acute neuroinflammation during DKA, however, treatment with these agents for 1\u00e2\u20ac\u2030week after DKA does not reduce long-term neuroinflammation."

We assessed marital relationship satisfaction, parent neuroticism, and child effortful control through the use of validated questionnaires. We used univariate comparisons and multivariable models to determine whether marital relationship satisfaction was associated with hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] and whether this association persisted after adjusting for demographic factors and parent neuroticism/child effortful control.ResultsIn univariate analyses, HbA1c was associated with marital relationship satisfaction of the primary caregiver. In multivariable models adjusting for demographic factors, marital satisfaction remained associated with HbA1c, whereas none of the other factors tested (including family income and race/ethnicity) retained significance. In univariate analyses, child effortful control was also associated with HbA1c. When child effortful control was added to the multivariable model, marital satisfaction remained associated with HbA1c with similar coefficient and confidence intervals describing the relationship between marital satisfaction and hemoglobin A1c.ConclusionsHigher levels of marital satisfaction of the primary diabetes caregiver are associated with glycemic outcomes for children with type 1 diabetes. Interventions to improve spousal relationships may have downstream benefits that could include promoting more optimal child HbA1c levels."

In this paper, we assess the potential of a stimulus-driven linear oscillator model (57) to predict dynamic attention to complex musical rhythms on an instant-by-instant basis. We use perceptual thresholds and pupillometry as attentional indices against which to test our model predictions. During a deviance detection task, participants listened to continuously looping, multiinstrument, rhythmic patterns, while being eye-tracked. Their task was to respond anytime they heard an increase in intensity (dB SPL). An adaptive thresholding algorithm adjusted deviant intensity at multiple probed temporal locations throughout each rhythmic stimulus. The oscillator model predicted participants' perceptual thresholds for detecting deviants at probed locations, with a low temporal salience prediction corresponding to a high perceptual threshold and vice versa. A pupil dilation response was observed for all deviants. Notably, the pupil dilated even when participants did not report hearing a deviant. Maximum pupil size and resonator model output were significant predictors of whether a deviant was detected or missed on any given trial. Besides the evoked pupillary response to deviants, we also assessed the continuous pupillary signal to the rhythmic patterns. The pupil exhibited entrainment at prominent periodicities present in the stimuli and followed each of the different rhythmic patterns in a unique way. Overall, these results replicate previous studies using the linear oscillator model to predict dynamic attention to complex auditory scenes and extend the utility of the model to the prediction of neurophysiological signals, in this case the pupillary time course; however, we note that the amplitude envelope of the acoustic patterns may serve as a similarly useful predictor. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to show entrainment of pupil dynamics by demonstrating a phase relationship between musical stimuli and the pupillary signal."

Controls were frequency matched for gender, age, and smoking history. There were 52 adenocarcinoma cases and 31 controls in ADC1 and 43 adenocarcinoma cases and 43 controls in ADC2. Metabolomics was conducted using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Differential analysis was performed on ADC1 and the top candidates (FDR < 0.05) for serum and plasma used to develop individual and multiplex classifiers that were then tested on an independent set of serum and plasma samples (ADC2).ResultsAspartate provided the best accuracy (81.4%) for an individual metabolite classifier in serum, whereas pyrophosphate had the best accuracy (77.9%) in plasma when independently tested. Multiplex classifiers of either 2 or 4 serum metabolites had an accuracy of 72.7% when independently tested. For plasma, a multimetabolite classifier consisting of 8 metabolites gave an accuracy of 77.3% when independently tested. Comparison of overall diagnostic performance between the two blood matrices yielded similar performances. However, serum is most ideal given higher sensitivity for low-abundant metabolites.ConclusionThis study shows the potential of metabolite-based diagnostic tests for detection of lung adenocarcinoma. Further validation in a larger pool of samples is warranted.ImpactThese biomarkers could improve early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer."

        "abstract": "Quantitative dynamic PET with compartmental modeling has the potential to enable multiparametric imaging and more accurate quantification than static PET imaging. Conventional methods for parametric imaging commonly use a single kinetic model for all image voxels and neglect the heterogeneity of physiologic models, which can work well for single-organ parametric imaging but may significantly compromise total-body parametric imaging on a scanner with a long axial field of view. In this paper, we evaluate the necessity of voxelwise compartmental modeling strategies, including time delay correction (TDC) and model selection, for total-body multiparametric imaging. Methods: Ten subjects (5 patients with metastatic cancer and 5 healthy volunteers) were scanned on a total-body PET/CT system after injection of 370 MBq of 18F-FDG. Dynamic data were acquired for 60 min. Total-body parametric imaging was performed using 2 approaches. One was the conventional method that uses a single irreversible 2-tissue-compartment model with and without TDC. The second approach selects the best kinetic model from 3 candidate models for individual voxels. The differences between the 2 approaches were evaluated for parametric imaging of microkinetic parameters and the 18F-FDG net influx rate, KiResults: TDC had a nonnegligible effect on kinetic quantification of various organs and lesions. The effect was larger in lesions with a higher blood volume. Parametric imaging of Ki with the standard 2-tissue-compartment model introduced vascular-region artifacts, which were overcome by the voxelwise model selection strategy. Conclusion: The time delay and appropriate kinetic model vary in different organs and lesions. Modeling of the time delay of the blood input function and model selection improved total-body multiparametric imaging."

        "abstract": "A five-state model of myofilament contraction was integrated into a well-established rabbit ventricular myocyte model of ion channels, Ca(2+) transporters and kinase signaling to analyze the relative contribution of different phosphorylation targets to the overall mechanical response driven by \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic stimulation (\u00ce\u00b2-AS). \u00ce\u00b2-AS effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) handling, Ca(2+), K(+) and Cl(-) currents, and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase properties was included based on experimental data. The inotropic effect on the myofilaments was represented as reduced myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (XBCa) and titin stiffness, and increased cross-bridge (XB) cycling rate (XBcy). Assuming independent roles of XBCa and XBcy, the model reproduced experimental \u00ce\u00b2-AS responses on action potentials and Ca(2+) transient amplitude and kinetics. It also replicated the behavior of force-Ca(2+), release-restretch, length-step, stiffness-frequency and force-velocity relationships, and increased force and shortening in isometric and isotonic twitch contractions. The \u00ce\u00b2-AS effect was then switched off from individual targets to analyze their relative impact on contractility. Preventing \u00ce\u00b2-AS effects on L-type Ca(2+) channels or phospholamban limited Ca(2+) transients and contractile responses in parallel, while blocking phospholemman and K(+) channel (IKs) effects enhanced Ca(2+) and inotropy. Removal of \u00ce\u00b2-AS effects from XBCa enhanced contractile force while decreasing peak Ca(2+) (due to greater Ca(2+) buffering), but had less effect on shortening. Conversely, preventing \u00ce\u00b2-AS effects on XBcy preserved Ca(2+) transient effects, but blunted inotropy (both isometric force and especially shortening). Removal of titin effects had little impact on contraction. Finally, exclusion of \u00ce\u00b2-AS from XBCa and XBcy while preserving effects on other targets resulted in preserved peak isometric force response (with slower kinetics) but nearly abolished enhanced shortening. \u00ce\u00b2-AS effects on XBCa and XBcy have greater impact on isometric and isotonic contraction, respectively."

In murine arterial myocytes, kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the increase in CaV1.2 activity in response to increased extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the CaV1.2 channel pore-forming subunit (\u00ce\u00b11C) within nanometer proximity of protein kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human arterial myocytes. This arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated increases in CaV1.2 channel activity were associated with PKA activity, leading to \u00ce\u00b11C phosphorylation at Ser1928 Compared to arteries from low-fat diet (LFD)-fed mice and nondiabetic patients, arteries from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and from diabetic patients had increased Ser1928 phosphorylation and CaV1.2 activity. Arterial myocytes and arteries from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to bind PKA did not exhibit increased Ser1928 phosphorylation and CaV1.2 current density in response to increased glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional role for Ser1928 phosphorylation, arterial myocytes and arteries from knockin mice expressing a CaV1.2 with Ser1928 mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked glucose-mediated increases in CaV1.2 activity and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the HFD-induced increases in CaV1.2 current density and myogenic tone were prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for \u00ce\u00b11C phosphorylation at Ser1928 in stimulating CaV1.2 channel activity and vasoconstriction by AKAP-targeted PKA upon exposure to increased glucose and in diabetes."

        "abstract": "Casein-hydrolysates (NaCaH) are desirable functional ingredients, but their bitterness impedes usage in foods. This study sought to validate a paper-disk approach to help evaluate bitterness in NaCaHs and to develop a food-grade approach to separate a NaCaH into distinct fractions, which could be evaluated by a sensory panel. Membrane filtration generated <0.2-\u00ce\u00bcm and <3-kDa permeates. Further fractionation of the <3-kDa permeate by flash-chromatography generated four fractions using ethanol (EtOH) concentrations of 5, 10, 30 and 50%. As some fractions were poorly soluble in water, the fractions were resolubilzed in EtOH and impregnated into paper-disks for sensory evaluation. Bitterness differences observed in the membrane fractions using this sensory evaluation approach reflected those observed for the same fractions presented as a liquid. The flash-chromatography fractions increased in bitterness with an increase in hydrophobicity, except for the 50% EtOH fraction which had little bitterness. Amino acid analysis of the fractions showed enrichment of different essential amino acids in both the bitter and less bitter fractions. The developed food-grade fractionation system, allowed for a simple and reasonably scaled approach to separating a NaCaH, into physicochemically different fractions that could be evaluated by a sensory panel. The method of sensory evaluation used in this study, in which NaCaH samples are impregnated into paper-disks, provided potential solutions for issues such as sample insolubility and limited quantities of sample. As the impregnated paper-disk samples were dehydrated, their long storage life could also be suitable for sensory evaluations distributed by mail for large consumer studies. The research, in this study, allowed for a greater understanding of the physicochemical basis for bitterness in this NaCaH. As some essential amino acids were enriched in the less bitter fractions, selective removal of bitter fractions could allow for the incorporation of the less bitter NaCaH fractions into food products for added nutritional value, without negatively impacting sensory properties. There is potential for this approach to be applied to other food ingredients with undesirable tastes, such as polyphenols."

        "abstract": "Precise regulation of flowering time is critical for plant reproductive success and, in cereals, to maximize grain yields. Seasonal cues including temperature and day length are integrated to regulate the timing of flowering. In temperate cereals, extended periods of cold (vernalization) release the repression of FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1), which is upregulated in the leaves in response to inductive long-day photoperiods. FT1 is a homolog of rice HD3a, which encodes a protein transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem to induce flowering. A rare FT-B1 allele from the wheat variety \"Hope\" has been previously shown to be associated with an early flowering phenotype under long-day photoperiods. Here, we demonstrate that the Hope FT-B1 allele accelerates flowering even under short days, and that it is epistatic to the VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1) gene. On average, the introgression of Hope FT-B1 into 6 genetic backgrounds resulted in 2.6 days acceleration of flowering (P<0.0001) and 4.1% increase in spike weight (P=0.0093), although in one variety, it was associated with a decrease in spike weight. These results suggest that the Hope FT-B1 allele could be useful in wheat breeding programs to subtly accelerate floral development and increase adaptation to changing environments."

The 1918 EST loci were not distributed uniformly among the three group 4 chromosomes; 41, 28, and 31% mapped to chromosomes 4A, 4B, and 4D, respectively. This pattern is in contrast to the cumulative results of EST mapping in all homoeologous groups, as reported elsewhere, that found the highest proportion of loci mapped to the B genome. Sixty-five percent of these 1918 loci mapped to the long arms of homoeologous group 4 chromosomes, while 35% mapped to the short arms. The distal regions of chromosome arms showed higher numbers of loci than the proximal regions, with the exception of 4DL. This study confirmed the complex structure of chromosome 4A that contains two reciprocal translocations and two inversions, previously identified. An additional inversion in the centromeric region of 4A was revealed. A consensus map for homoeologous group 4 was developed from 119 ESTs unique to group 4. Forty-nine percent of these ESTs were found to be homoeologous to sequences on rice chromosome 3, 12% had matches with sequences on other rice chromosomes, and 39% had no matches with rice sequences at all. Limited homology (only 26 of the 119 consensus ESTs) was found between wheat ESTs on homoeologous group 4 and the Arabidopsis genome. Forty-two percent of the homoeologous group 4 ESTs could be classified into functional categories on the basis of blastX searches against all protein databases."

In this study, we report the isolation of BAC clones containing genes coding for three different enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway: phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), and zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS). Primers were designed on the basis of wheat ESTs similar to the sequences of these three genes in other species, and used to screen a BAC library from Triticum turgidum var. durum (2n = 28, genomes AABB). Eight, six, and nine 384-well plates containing at least one positive clone were found for PSY, PDS, and ZDS, respectively. BACs selected for each of these genes were then divided in two groups corresponding to the A and B genomes of tetraploid wheat, based on differences in the length of the PCR amplification products, conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE), or cleavage amplification polymorphisms. Positive clones were then assigned to chromosomes using a set of D genome substitution lines in T. turgidum var. durum 'Langdon'. PSY clones were localized on chromosomes 5A and 5B, PDS on chromosomes 4A and 4B, and ZDS on chromosomes 2A and 2B. The strategies used for the PCR screening of large BAC libraries and for the differentiation of BAC clones from different genomes in a polyploid species are discussed."

        "abstract": "VRN-2 is a dominant repressor of flowering that plays a central role in the vernalization pathway of wheat. This gene is a zinc-finger/CCT domain transcription factor (ZCCT-1) down-regulated by vernalization. In barley, there are three related and linked ZCCT genes designated VRN-H1a, b, and c. A deletion of these three genes was observed in six putative spring induced mutants from winter barley variety 'Chikurin Ibaraki I'. However, analysis of additional molecular markers demonstrated that these deletions were originated by outcrossing with a spring barley variety carrying the natural ZCCT deletion. Hybridization of Southern blots from 84 barley varieties with a wheat ZCCT1 probe showed three or more fragments in 23 winter varieties but none in 60 out of the 61 vrn-H2 spring varieties. The vrn-H2-spring barley variety 'Fan' showed only the ZCCT-Hb gene, suggesting that this gene is not sufficient to determine winter growth habit in barley. We also show in this study, that the effect of VRN-H2 on flowering time completely disappears in the presence of the dominant Vrn-H1 allele in a Morex x Hordeum spontaneum segregating population. A different result was described before for the epistatic interactions between the orthologous genes in diploid wheat. We discuss the possible causes of these differences."

        "abstract": "Leaf, spike, stem, and root morphologies are key factors that determine crop growth, development, and productivity. Multiple genes that control these morphological traits have been identified in Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and other plant species. However, little is known about the genomic regions and genes associated with morphological traits in wheat. Here, we identified the ethyl methanesulfonate-derived mutant wheat line M133 that displays multiple morphological changes that include upward-curled leaves, paired spikelets, dwarfism, and delayed heading. Using bulked segregant RNA sequencing (BSR-seq) and a high-resolution genetic map, we identified TraesCS1D02G155200 (HB-D2) as a potential candidate gene. HB-D2 encodes a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factor, and the mutation was located in the miRNA165/166 complementary site, resulting in a resistant allele designated rHb-D2. The relative expression of rHb2 in the mutant plants was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in plants homozygous for the WT allele. Independent resistant mutations that disrupt the miRNA165/166 complementary sites in the A- (rHb-A2) and B-genome (rHb-B2) homoeologs showed similar phenotypic alterations, but the relative intensity of the effects was different. Transgenic plants expressing rHb-D2 gene driven by the maize UBIQUITIN (UBI) promoter showed similar phenotypes to the rHb-D2 mutant. These results confirmed that HB-D2 is the causal gene responsible for the mutant phenotypes. Finally, a survey of 1397 wheat accessions showed that the complementary sites for miRNA165/166 in all three HB2 homoeologs are highly conserved. Our results suggest that HB2 plays an important role in regulating growth and development in wheat."

In this study, we carried out a gene co-expression analysis of all currently publicly available microarray data, which were generated in experiments that studied the interaction of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with microbial pathogens. This work was conducted to identify (i) modules of functionally related co-expressed genes that are differentially expressed in response to multiple biotic stresses, and (ii) hub genes that may function as core regulators of disease responses. Using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) we constructed an undirected network leveraging a rich curated expression dataset comprising 272 microarrays that involved microbial infections of Arabidopsis plants with a wide array of fungal and bacterial pathogens with biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, and necrotrophic lifestyles. WGCNA produced a network with scale-free and small-world properties composed of 205 distinct clusters of co-expressed genes. Modules of functionally related co-expressed genes that are differentially regulated in response to multiple pathogens were identified by integrating differential gene expression testing with functional enrichment analyses of gene ontology terms, known disease associated genes, transcriptional regulators, and cis-regulatory elements. The significance of functional enrichments was validated by comparisons with randomly generated networks. Network topology was then analyzed to identify intra- and inter-modular gene hubs. Based on high connectivity, and centrality in meta-modules that are clearly enriched in defense responses, we propose a list of 66 target genes for reverse genetic experiments to further dissect the Arabidopsis immune system. Our results show that statistical-based data trimming prior to network analysis allows the integration of expression datasets generated by different groups, under different experimental conditions and biological systems, into a functionally meaningful co-expression network."

To explore the feasibility of selecting for increased resistance to gray mold, we undertook genetic and genomic prediction studies in strawberry populations segregating for fruit quality and shelf life traits hypothesized to pleiotropically affect susceptibility. As predicted, resistance to gray mold was heritable but quantitative and genetically complex. While every individual was susceptible, the speed of symptom progression and severity differed. Narrow-sense heritability ranged from 0.38 to 0.71 for lesion diameter (LD) and 0.39 to 0.44 for speed of emergence of external mycelium (EM). Even though significant additive genetic variation was observed for LD and EM, the phenotypic ranges were comparatively narrow and genome-wide analyses did not identify any large-effect loci. Genomic selection (GS) accuracy ranged from 0.28 to 0.59 for LD and 0.37 to 0.47 for EM. Additive genetic correlations between fruit quality and gray mold resistance traits were consistent with prevailing hypotheses: LD decreased as titratable acidity increased, whereas EM increased as soluble solid content decreased and firmness increased. We concluded that phenotypic and GS could be effective for reducing LD and increasing EM, especially in long shelf life populations, but that a significant fraction of the genetic variation for resistance to gray mold was caused by the pleiotropic effects of fruit quality traits that differ among market and shelf life classes."

In the current study, we examined the impact of brain-reactive maternal autoantibodies of mothers of children with autism (MAU) on offspring behavior in mice compared to offspring exposed to non-reactive IgG of mothers of typically developing children (MTD). Embryonic offspring were exposed to a single intraventricular injection of MAU or MTD IgG on embryonic day 14. Offspring were allowed to mature to adulthood and were subsequently tested for sociability and stereotypic behaviors using a 3-chambered social approach task, marble burying task, and assessment of spontaneous grooming behaviors in response to a novel environment. Results indicate that MAU offspring display autistic-like stereotypical behavior in both marble burying and spontaneous grooming behaviors. Additionally, small alterations in social approach behavior were also observed in MAU offspring compared to MTD offspring.

Iron is essential for many facets of cell metabolism in the brain but when altered is likely to contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We previously reported that iron accumulates in the choroid plexus and the putamen in FXTAS and that the level and distribution of key iron-binding proteins are also altered, suggesting a potential alteration of iron metabolism in the brain. Here, we hypothesize that iron metabolism is also altered in the FXTAS cerebellum. To test this hypothesis, we used cerebellum samples collected from FXTAS and control subjects and measured the amount of iron contained within the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus. We found that the number of iron deposits increased in the cerebellum only&nbsp;in a subset of cases of FXTAS. This accumulation is likely to be mediated by factors other than or in addition to CGG-repeat coupled pathology. Thus, iron deposition in the cerebellum cannot be used as a hallmark of FXTAS pathogenesis."

        "abstract": "Metabolomic profiling can be used to study disease-induced changes in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in the metabolomic profile of males and females as they developed IBD. Using the IL-10 gene-deficient mouse model of IBD and wild-type mice, urine at age 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks was collected and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Multivariate data analysis was employed to assess differences in metabolomic profiles that occurred as a consequence of IBD development and severity (at week 20). These changes were contrasted to those that occurred as a consequence of gender. Our results demonstrate that both IL-10 gene-deficient and wild-type mice exhibit gender-related changes in urinary metabolomic profile over time. Some male-female separating metabolites are common to both IL-10 gene-deficient and control wild-type mice and, therefore, appear to be related predominantly to gender maturation. In addition, we were able to identify gender-separating metabolites that are unique for IL-10 gene-deficient and wild-type mice and, therefore, may be indicative of a gender-specific involvement in the development and severity of the intestinal inflammation. The comparison of the gender-separating metabolomic profile from IL-10 gene-deficient mice and wild-type mice during the development of IBD allowed us to identify changes in profile patterns that appear to be imperative in the development of intestinal inflammation, but yet central to gender-related differences in IBD development. The knowledge of metabolomic profile differences by gender and by disease severity has potential clinical implications in the design of both biomarkers of disease as well as the development of optimal therapies."

        "abstract": "Abstract: \r\n\r\n        Background\r\n Aging and diet are risks for metabolic diseases. Bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO) mice develop metabolic liver diseases that progress into cancer as they age, which is accelerated by Western diet (WD) intake. The current study uncovers the molecular signatures for diet and age-linked metabolic liver disease development in an FXR-dependent manner.\r\nMethods\r\n Wild-type (WT) and FXR KO male mice, either on a healthy control diet (CD) or a WD, were euthanized at the ages of 5-, 10-, or 15-months. Hepatic transcriptomics, liver, serum, and urine metabolomics as well as microbiota were profiled.\r\nResults\r\n WD intake facilitated hepatic aging in WT mice. In an FXR-dependent manner, increased inflammation and reduced oxidative phosphorylation were the primary pathways affected by WD and aging. FXR has a role in modulating inflammation and B cell-mediated humoral immunity which was enhanced by aging. Moreover, FXR dictated neuron differentiation, muscle contraction, and cytoskeleton organization in addition to metabolism. There were 654 transcripts commonly altered by diets, ages, and FXR KO, and 76 of them were differentially expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy livers. Urine metabolites differentiated dietary effects in both genotypes, and serum metabolites clearly separated ages irrespective of diets. Aging and FXR KO commonly affected amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle. Moreover, FXR is essential for colonization of age-related gut microbes. Integrated analyses uncovered metabolites and bacteria linked with hepatic transcripts affected by WD intake, aging, and FXR KO as well as related to HCC patient survival.\r\nConclusion\r\n FXR is target to prevent diet or age-associated metabolic disease. The uncovered metabolites and microbes can be diagnostic markers for metabolic disease."

For certain supersymmetric two charge black holes these corrections drastically alter the causal structure of the solution, converting seemingly pathological null singularities into timelike singularities hidden behind a finite area horizon. We establish, analytically and numerically, that the string-corrected two-charge black hole metric has the same Penrose diagram as the extremal four-charge black hole. The higher derivative terms lead to another dramatic effect -- the gravitational force exerted by a black hole on an inertial observer is no longer purely attractive! The magnitude of this effect is related to the size of the compactification manifold."

        "abstract": "Nutrient loading and air emissions from swine operations raise environmental concerns. The objective of the study was to describe and evaluate a mathematical model (Davis Swine Model) of nutrient partitioning and predict manure excretion and composition on a daily basis. State variables of the model were AA, fatty acids, and a central pool of metabolites that supplied substrate for lipid synthesis and oxidation. The model traced the fate of ingested nutrients and water through digestion and intermediary metabolism into body protein, fat, water, and ash, where body protein and fat represented the body constituent pools. It was assumed that fluxes of metabolites follow saturation kinetics, depending on metabolite concentrations. The main inputs to the model were diet nutrient composition, feed intake, water-to-feed ratio, and initial BW. First, the model was challenged with nutrient partitioning data and then with excretion data. The data had 48 different feeding regimes with contrasting energy and lysine intakes at 2 different stages of growth. The overall observed and predicted mean were 109 and 112 g/d for protein deposition and 132 and 136 g/d for lipid deposition respectively, suggesting minor mean bias. Root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) was used in evaluation of the model for its predictive power. The overall RMSPE was 2.2 and 4.1 g/d for protein and lipid deposition, respectively. The excretion database used for evaluation of the model was constructed from 150 digestibility trials using growing-finishing pig diets that had a wide range of nutrient chemical composition. Nutrient and water excretion were quantified using the principle of mass conservation. The average daily observed and predicted manure production was 3.79 and 3.99 kg/d, respectively, with a RMSPE of 0.49 kg/d. There was a good agreement between observed and predicted mean fecal N output (9.9 and 9.8 g/d, respectively). Similarly, the overall observed and predicted mean urine N output was 21.7 and 21.3 g/d, respectively, suggesting minor mean bias. The RMSPE was 1.9 and 4.1 g/d for fecal and urinary N, respectively. Evaluation of the model showed that the model predicts manure excretion and N content well and can be used to assess environmental mitigation options from swine operations."

        "abstract": "Determination of appropriate nutritional requirements is essential to optimize the productivity and longevity of lactating sows. The current recommendations for requirements do not consider the large variation between animals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the amino acid recommendations for lactating sows using a stochastic modeling approach that integrates population variation and uncertainty of key parameters into establishing nutritional recommendations for lactating sows. The requirement for individual sows was calculated using a factorial approach by adding the requirement for maintenance and milk. The energy balance of the sows was either negative or zero depending on feed intake being a limiting factor. Some parameters in the model were sow-specific and others were population-specific, depending on state of knowledge. Each simulation was for 1000 sows repeated 100 times using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. BW, back fat thickness of the sow, litter size (LS), average litter gain (LG), dietary energy density and feed intake were inputs to the model. The model was tested using results from the literature, and the values were all within \u00c2\u00b11 s.d. of the estimated requirements. Simulations were made for a group of low- (LS=10 (s.d.=1), LG=2 kg/day (s.d.=0.6)), medium- (LS=12 (s.d.=1), LG=2.5 kg/day (s.d.=0.6)) and high-producing (LS=14 (s.d.=1), LG=3.5 kg/day (s.d.=0.6)) sows, where the average requirement was the result. In another simulation, the requirements were estimated for each week of lactation. The results were given as the median and s.d. The average daily standardized ileal digestible (SID) protein and lysine requirements for low-, medium- and high-producing sows were 623 (CV=2.5%) and 45.1 (CV=4.8%); 765 (CV=4.9%) and 54.7 (CV=7.0%); and 996 (CV=8.5%) and 70.8 g/day (CV=9.6%), respectively. The SID protein and lysine requirements were lowest at week 1, intermediate at week 2 and 4 and the highest at week 3 of lactation. The model is a valuable tool to develop new feeding strategies by taking into account the variable requirement between groups of sows and changes during lactation. The inclusion of between-sow variation gives information on safety margins when developing new dietary recommendations of amino acids and protein for lactating sows."

Filling knowledge gaps and providing expert recommendation are important for defining future research priorities, improving methodologies and establishing science-based GHG mitigation solutions to government and non-governmental organisations, advisory/extension networks, and the ruminant livestock sector. The objectives of this review is to summarize published literature to provide a detailed assessment of the methodologies currently in use for measuring enteric methane (CH4) emission from individual animals under specific conditions, and give recommendations regarding their application. The methods described include respiration chambers and enclosures, sulphur hexafluoride tracer (SF6) technique, and techniques based on short-term measurements of gas concentrations in samples of exhaled air. This includes automated head chambers (e.g. the GreenFeed system), the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a marker, and (handheld) laser CH4 detection. Each of the techniques are compared and assessed on their capability and limitations, followed by methodology recommendations. It is concluded that there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcone size fits all\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 method for measuring CH4 emission by individual animals. Ultimately, the decision as to which method to use should be based on the experimental objectives and resources available. However, the need for high throughput methodology e.g. for screening large numbers of animals for genomic studies, does not justify the use of methods that are inaccurate. All CH4 measurement techniques are subject to experimental variation and random errors. Many sources of variation must be considered when measuring CH4 concentration in exhaled air samples without a quantitative or at least regular collection rate, or use of a marker to indicate (or adjust) for the proportion of exhaled CH4 sampled. Consideration of the number and timing of measurements relative to diurnal patterns of CH4 emission and respiratory exchange are important, as well as consideration of feeding patterns and associated patterns of rumen fermentation rate and other aspects of animal behaviour. Regardless of the method chosen, appropriate calibrations and recovery tests are required for both method establishment and routine operation. Successful and correct use of methods requires careful attention to detail, rigour, and routine self-assessment of the quality of the data they provide."

We first screened for phenotypes in mouse lines with both ocular and renal or reproductive trait abnormalities. The STRING protein interaction tool was used to identify interactions between known cilia gene products and those encoded by the genes in individual knockout mouse strains in order to generate a list of \"candidate ciliopathy genes.\" From this list, 32 genes encoded proteins predicted to interact with known ciliopathy proteins. Of these, 25 had no previously described roles in ciliary pathobiology. Histological and morphological evidence of phenotypes found in ciliopathies in knockout mouse lines are presented as examples (genes Abi2, Wdr62, Ap4e1, Dync1li1, and Prkab1). Phenotyping data and descriptions generated on IMPC mouse line are useful for mechanistic studies, target discovery, rare disease diagnosis, and preclinical therapeutic development trials.

XLRS is attributed to functional loss of the retinal adhesion protein retinoschisin 1 (RS1), but the pathophysiology of myopic foveoschisis is unclear due to the lack of animal models. Here, we characterized a novel nonhuman primate model of myopic foveoschisis through clinical examination and multimodal imaging followed by morphologic, cellular, and transcriptional profiling of retinal tissues and genetic analysis.MethodsWe identified a rhesus macaque with behavioral and anatomic features of myopic foveoschisis, and monitored disease progression over 14 months by fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After necropsy, we evaluated anatomic and cellular changes by immunohistochemistry and transcriptomic changes using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq). Finally, we performed Sanger and whole exome sequencing with focus on the RS1 gene.ResultsAffected eyes demonstrated posterior hyaloid traction and progressive splitting of the outer plexiform layer on OCT. Immunohistochemistry showed increased GFAP expression in M\u00c3\u00bcller glia and loss of ramified Iba-1+ microglia, suggesting macro- and microglial activation with minimal photoreceptor alterations. SnRNA-seq revealed gene expression changes predominantly in cones and retinal ganglion cells involving chromatin modification, suggestive of cellular stress at the fovea. No defects in the RS1 gene or its expression were detected.ConclusionsThis nonhuman primate model of foveoschisis reveals insights into how acquired myopic traction leads to phenotypically similar morphologic and cellular changes as congenital XLRS without alterations in RS1."

Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline and final visit, and drug-related adverse events were analyzed. Eyes with recurrent macular fluid on IVBr every 8 weeks were treated with a combination therapy alternating between IVBr and aflibercept every month.ResultsAmong 52 eyes (40 patients) on IVBr, all had been previously treated with other anti-VEGF therapy, with 73% having persistent macular fluid. After a mean follow-up of 46.2\u00c2\u00b127.4 weeks on IVBr, the mean treatment interval for intravitreal therapy increased to 8.8\u00c2\u00b12.1 weeks on IVBr from a baseline of 6.1\u00c2\u00b13.1 weeks (p<0.001). Macular fluid decreased and BCVA was stable/improved in 61.5% of eyes on IVBr. Ten eyes with increased macular fluid on IVBr monotherapy when extended to every 8 weeks were treated with combination therapy alternating between IVBr and aflibercept every 4 weeks. In these eyes, 80% had improved macular fluid on OCT and 70% stable or improved BCVA after a median follow-up of 53 weeks on combination therapy. Mild intraocular inflammation developed in four eyes, all occurring on IVBr monotherapy, and none had associated vision loss.ConclusionIn the real world, IVBr used to treat eyes with nAMD previously treated with other anti-VEGF therapies appears to be well tolerated and associated with an improvement in macular fluid, stabilization of BCVA, and/or increase in intravitreal treatment interval. Combination therapy alternating between IVBr and aflibercept monthly appears to be well tolerated and can be considered for eyes with macular fluid on IVBr every 8 weeks."

Naturally occurring diseases in large animal species may serve as surrogate animal models of human disease, as they may better reflect the complex genetic, environmental, and physiologic variation present in outbred populations. We work with naturally occurring diseases in large animal species to better understand how MSCs work and to facilitate optimal translation of MSC-based therapies. We are investigating the use of MSC therapy for a chronic oral inflammatory disease in cats. During our efforts to expand fat-derived feline MSCs (fMSCs), we observed that\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc50% of the cell lines developed giant foamy multinucleated cells in later passages. These morphologic alterations were associated with proliferation arrest. We hypothesized that the cytopathic effects were caused by infection with a retrovirus, feline foamy virus (FFV). Using transmission electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, and in vitro assays, we determined that syncytial cell formation and proliferation arrest in fMSCs were caused by FFV strains that were highly homologous to previously reported FFV strains. We determined that the antiretroviral drug, tenofovir, may be used to support ex vivo expansion and salvage of FFV-infected fMSC lines. MSC lines derived from specific pathogen-free cats do not appear to be infected with FFV and may be a source of allogeneic fMSCs for clinical application. FFV infection of fMSC lines may hinder large-scale expansion of autologous MSC for therapeutic use in feline patients."

        "abstract": "Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 0.6% of the canine population and yet, its etiology is poorly understood. Most affected dogs are diagnosed as adults and are insulin-dependent. We compared pan-leukocyte and sympathetic innervation markers in pancreatic islets of adult dogs with spontaneous DM (sDM), spontaneous pancreatitis (sPanc), both (sDMPanc), toxin-induced DM (iDM) and controls. We found evidence of decreased islet sympathetic innervation but no significant infiltration of islets with leukocytes in all disease groups. We show that loss of sympathetic innervation is ongoing in canine DM and does not necessarily precede it. We further found selective loss of islet-associated beta cells in dogs with sDM and sDMPanc, suggesting that collateral damage from inflammation in the exocrine pancreas is not a likely cause of DM in these dogs. The cause of this selective loss of beta cells needs to be further elucidated but overall, our findings are not supportive of an autoimmune process as a cause of sDM in adult dogs. The loss of sympathetic innervation in sPanc in dogs that do not suffer from DM links the disease in the exocrine pancreas to a pathological process in the endocrine pancreas, suggesting pancreatitis might be a potential precursor to DM."

Canine-specific regulators of somatic cell reprogramming and pluripotency maintenance are poorly understood. While retroviral delivery of the four Yamanaka factors successfully reprogrammed canine embryonic fibroblasts, adult stromal cells remained resistant to reprogramming in spite of effective viral transduction and transgene expression. We hypothesized that adult stromal cells fail to reprogram due to an epigenetic barrier. Here, we performed assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on canine stromal and pluripotent stem cells, analyzing 51 samples in total, and establishing the global landscape of chromatin accessibility before and after reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). We also studied adult stromal cells that do not yield iPSC colonies to identify potential reprogramming barriers. ATAC-seq analysis identified distinct cell type clustering patterns and chromatin remodeling during embryonic fibroblast reprogramming. Compared with embryonic fibroblasts, adult stromal cells had a chromatin accessibility landscape that reflects phenotypic differentiation and somatic cell-fate stability. We ultimately identified 76 candidate genes and several transcription factor binding motifs that may be impeding somatic cell reprogramming to iPSC, and could be targeted for inhibition or activation, in order to improve the process in canines. These results provide a vast resource for better understanding of pluripotency regulators in dogs and provide an unbiased rationale for novel canine-specific reprogramming approaches."

        "abstract": "At the onset of mitosis, centrosomes expand the pericentriolar material (PCM) to maximize their microtubule-organizing activity. This step, termed centrosome maturation, ensures proper spindle organization and faithful chromosome segregation. However, as the centrosome expands, how PCM proteins are recruited and held together without membrane enclosure remains elusive. We found that endogenously expressed pericentrin (PCNT), a conserved PCM scaffold protein, condenses into dynamic granules during late G2/early mitosis before incorporating into mitotic centrosomes. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of PCNT, enriched with conserved coiled-coils (CCs) and low-complexity regions (LCRs), phase separates into dynamic condensates that selectively recruit PCM proteins and nucleate microtubules in cells. We propose that CCs and LCRs, two prevalent sequence features in the centrosomal proteome, are preserved under evolutionary pressure in part to mediate liquid-liquid phase separation, a process that bestows upon the centrosome distinct properties critical for its assembly and functions."

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The availability of low cost sequencing has spurred its application to discovery and typing of variation, including variation induced by mutagenesis. Mutation discovery is challenging as it requires a substantial amount of sequencing and analysis to detect very rare changes and distinguish them from noise. Also challenging are the cases when the organism of interest has not been sequenced or is highly divergent from the reference. Results We describe the development of a simple method for reduced representation sequencing. Input DNA was digested with a single restriction enzyme and ligated to Y adapters modified to contain a sequence barcode and to provide a compatible overhang for ligation. We demonstrated the efficiency of this method at SNP discovery using rice and arabidopsis. To test its suitability for the discovery of very rare SNP, one control and three mutagenized rice individuals (1, 5 and 10 mM sodium azide) were used to prepare genomic libraries for Illumina sequencers by ligating barcoded adapters to NlaIII restriction sites. For genome-dependent discovery 15-30 million of 80 base reads per individual were aligned to the reference sequence achieving individual sequencing coverage from 7 to 15\u00c3\u2014. We identified high-confidence base changes by comparing sequences across individuals and identified instances consistent with mutations, i.e. changes that were found in a single treated individual and were solely GC to AT transitions. For genome-independent discovery 70-mers were extracted from the sequence of the control individual and single-copy sequence was identified by comparing the 70-mers across samples to evaluate copy number and variation. This de novo \"genome\" was used to align the reads and identify mutations as above. Covering approximately 1/5 of the 380 Mb genome of rice we detected mutation densities ranging from 0.6 to 4 per Mb of diploid DNA depending on the mutagenic treatment. Conclusions The combination of a simple and cost-effective library construction method, with Illumina sequencing, and the use of a bioinformatic pipeline allows practical SNP discovery regardless of whether a genomic reference is available."

BMO extraction from bovine milk is challenged by low concentrations relative to nonbioactive simple sugars like lactose. BMO abundances are known to vary with a cow's lactation stage, breed, and parity, but these characteristics are difficult to modify in existing dairy herds. In contrast, diet modification is an accessible target, and is already known to influence milk yield, lipid content, protein levels, and monosaccharide compositions.ObjectivesTo determine the impact of a low starch high fiber versus a high starch low fiber diet on overall BMO profiles and individual BMO abundances in Holstein dairy cattle.MethodsMilk samples were collected from 59 midlactation Holsteins in a crossover study featuring dietary modification with either a low starch high fiber or high starch low fiber feed. BMO profiles were evaluated by nano-LC quadrupole time-of-flight tandem MS, and differences in BMO abundances between diets were evaluated using linear mixed effects modeling.ResultsA total of 19 BMOs were identified across the sample set, including 4 large fucosylated compounds. Seven BMOs were found to have significantly more positive percent changes in yield-adjusted abundance from the pre-experiment baseline period for milk samples collected during feeding with the low starch high fiber diet compared with the high starch low fiber diet.ConclusionsConsuming the low starch high fiber diet promoted greater overall BMO production than the high starch low fiber diet in a population of midlactation Holsteins. Additionally, this study afforded the opportunity to investigate the impact of other factors potentially influencing BMO abundances, furthering understanding of how dairy herd management practices can positively impact milk composition and support the potential use of BMOs as functional ingredients."

These two resistance proteins could thus mediate resistance against M.\u00e2\u20ac\u2030fijiensis if genetically transformed into banana (Musa spp.). However, disease resistance controlled by single dominant genes can be overcome by mutated effector alleles, whose products are not recognized by the cognate resistance proteins. Here, we surveyed the allelic variation within the MfAvr4, MfEcp2, MfEcp2-2 and MfEcp2-3 effector genes of M.\u00e2\u20ac\u2030fijiensis in a global population of the pathogen, and assayed its impact on recognition by the tomato Cf-4 and Cf-Ecp2 resistance proteins, respectively. We identified a large number of polymorphisms that could reflect a co-evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen. The analysis of nucleotide substitution patterns suggests that both positive selection and intragenic recombination have shaped the evolution of M.\u00e2\u20ac\u2030fijiensis effectors. Clear differences in allelic diversity were observed between strains originating from South-East Asia relative to strains from other banana-producing continents, consistent with the hypothesis that M.\u00e2\u20ac\u2030fijiensis originated in the Asian-Pacific region. Furthermore, transient co-expression of the MfAvr4 effector alleles and the tomato Cf-4 resistance gene, as well as of MfEcp2, MfEcp2-2 and MfEcp2-3 and the putative Cf-Ecp2 resistance gene, indicated that effector alleles able to overcome these resistance genes are already present in natural populations of the pathogen, thus questioning the durability of resistance that can be provided by these genes in the field."

        "abstract": "Parent- and adolescent-report of social skill importance and social skill engagement on the Social Skills Rating System (Gresham and Elliott in The social skills rating system, American Guidance Service, Circle Pines, 1990) were assessed in higher-functioning adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Compared to parents, adolescents reported that social skills were less important. Additionally, adolescents reported that they engaged in social skills more frequently than parents reported them to be engaging in social skills. Parents, but not adolescents, reported a discrepancy between importance and engagement, such that the importance of social skills was rated higher than the frequency of adolescent engagement in social skills. These results suggest that social skills interventions for individuals with ASD may need to target awareness of social skill importance and accurate monitoring of social skill engagement."

        "abstract": "A consensus has emerged that despite common core features, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has multiple etiologies and various genetic and biological characteristics. The fact that there are likely to be subtypes of ASD has complicated attempts to develop effective therapies. The UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project is a longitudinal, multidisciplinary analysis of children with autism and age-matched typically developing controls; nearly 400 families are participating in this study. The overarching goal is to gather sufficient biological, medical, and behavioral data to allow definition of clinically meaningful subtypes of ASD. One reasonable hypothesis is that different subtypes of autism will demonstrate different patterns of altered brain organization or development i.e., different neurophenotypes. In this Commentary, we discuss one neurophenotype that is defined by megalencephaly, or having brain size that is large and disproportionate to body size. We have found that 15% of the boys with autism demonstrate this neurophenotype, though it is far less common in girls. We review behavioral and medical characteristics of the large-brained group of boys with autism in comparison to those with typically sized brains. While brain size in typically developing individuals is positively correlated with cognitive function, the children with autism and larger brains have more severe disabilities and poorer prognosis. This research indicates that phenotyping in autism, like genotyping, requires a very substantial cohort of subjects. Moreover, since brain and behavior relationships may emerge at different times during development, this effort highlights the need for longitudinal analyses to carry out meaningful phenotyping.

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are widely theorized to result from altered brain connectivity. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has been a versatile method for investigating underlying microstructural properties of white matter (WM) in ASD. Despite phenotypic and etiological heterogeneity, DWI studies in majority male samples of older children, adolescents, and adults with ASD have largely reported findings of decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) across several commissural, projection, and association fiber tracts. However, studies in preschool-aged children (i.e., <\u00e2\u20ac\u203030-40\u00e2\u20ac\u2030months) suggest individuals with ASD have increased measures of WM FA earlier in development.MethodsWe analyzed 127 individuals with ASD (85\u00e2\u2122\u201a, 42\u00e2\u2122\u20ac) and 54 typically developing (TD) controls (42\u00e2\u2122\u201a, 26\u00e2\u2122\u20ac), aged 25.1-49.6\u00e2\u20ac\u2030months. Voxel-wise effects of ASD diagnosis, sex, age, and their interaction on DWI measures of FA, mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) while controlling mean absolute and relative motion.ResultsCompared to TD controls, males and females with ASD had significantly increased measures of FA in eight clusters (threshold-free cluster enhancement p < 0.05) that incorporated several WM tracts including regions of the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculi, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, and corticospinal tract. A diagnosis by sex interaction was observed in measures of AD across six significant clusters incorporating areas of the body, genu, and splenium of the corpus collosum. In these tracts, females with ASD showed increased AD compared to TD females, while males with ASD showed decreased AD compared to TD males.ConclusionsThe current findings support growing evidence that preschool-aged children with ASD have atypical measures of WM microstructure that appear to differ in directionality from alterations observed in older individuals with the condition. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest sample of preschool-aged females with ASD to be evaluated using DWI. Microstructural differences associated with ASD largely overlapped between sexes. However, differential relationships of AD measures indicate that sex likely modulates ASD neuroanatomical phenotypes. Further longitudinal study is needed to confirm and quantify the developmental relationship of WM structure in ASD."

        "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are frequently reported in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We evaluated the frequency and severity of GI symptoms in preschool-aged children with ASD compared to participants with typical development (TD). Our goal was to ascertain whether GI symptoms are associated with differences in sex or developmental and behavioral measures. Participants were between 2 and 3.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years of age and included 255 children with ASD (184 males/71 females) and 129 age-matched TD controls (75 males/54 females). A parent interview was used to assess GI symptoms (abdominal pain, gaseousness/bloating, diarrhea, constipation, pain on stooling, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, blood in stool or in vomit). Children with GI symptoms in each diagnostic group were compared to children without GI symptoms on measures of developmental, behavioral, and adaptive functioning. GI symptoms were reported more frequently in children with ASD compared to the TD group (47.8% vs. 17.8%, respectively). Children with ASD were also more likely to experience multiple GI symptoms (30.6% vs. 5.4%). GI symptoms were equally common in males and females across both diagnostic groups. There were no statistically significant differences in developmental or adaptive measures based on presence of GI symptoms in either ASD or TD children. Co-occurring GI symptoms were, however, associated with increased self-injurious behaviors, restricted stereotyped behaviors, aggressive behaviors, sleep problems and attention problems in both ASD and TD children. In children with ASD, a higher number of GI symptoms was associated with an increase in self-injurious behaviors, somatic complaints, reduced sleep duration, and increased parasomnias. LAY SUMMARY: ASD is characterized by challenges in social communication and repetitive behaviors. But, people with autism have many other difficulties including gastrointestinal problems. Children with ASD were three times more likely to experience GI symptoms than typically developing peers. Increased GI symptoms are associated with increased problem behaviors such as sleep problems, self-injury, and body aches. Since GI symptoms are often treatable, it is important to recognize them as soon as possible. Both clinicians and parents should become more aware of the high occurrence of GI problems in autistic people.

Compared with other strains of mice, EAE in the SJL mouse strain models multiple features of MS, including an enhanced sensitivity of female mice to disease; however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the sex- and strain-dependent differences in disease susceptibility have not been described. We identified sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) as a sex- and strain-specific, disease-modifying molecule that regulates BBB permeability by destabilizing adherens junctions. S1PR2 expression was increased in disease-susceptible regions of the CNS of both female SJL EAE mice and female patients with MS compared with their male counterparts. Pharmacological blockade or lack of S1PR2 signaling decreased EAE disease severity as the result of enhanced endothelial barrier function. Enhanced S1PR2 signaling in an in vitro BBB model altered adherens junction formation via activation of Rho/ROCK, CDC42, and caveolin endocytosis-dependent pathways, resulting in loss of apicobasal polarity and relocation of abluminal CXCL12 to vessel lumina. Furthermore, S1PR2-dependent BBB disruption and CXCL12 relocation were observed in vivo. These results identify a link between S1PR2 signaling and BBB polarity and implicate S1PR2 in sex-specific patterns of disease during CNS autoimmunity."

Excessive body fat can result in unhealthful metabolic and lipid profiles and increased risk of metabolic diseases. The objective was to estimate criterion validity of an obesity risk assessment tool targeting Spanish-speaking families of Mexican origin using anthropometric measures and blood values of their young children. A cross-sectional study design with five data collection sessions was conducted over an eight-week period and involved 206 parent/child dyads recruited at Head Start and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children in Northern California. Main outcome measures were criterion validity of Ni\u00c3\u00b1os Sanos, a pediatric obesity risk assessment tool, using anthropometric measures and blood biomarkers. Ni\u00c3\u00b1os Sanos scores were inversely related to child BMI-for-age percentiles (p = 0.02), waist-for-height ratios (p = 0.05) and inversely related to blood biomarkers for the metabolic index (p = 0.03) and lipid index (p = 0.05) and positively related to anti-inflammatory index (p = 0.047). Overall, children with higher Ni\u00c3\u00b1os Sanos scores had more healthful lipid, metabolic and inflammatory profiles, as well as lower BMI-for-age percentiles and waist-to height ratios, providing evidence for the criterion validity of the tool. Ni\u00c3\u00b1os Sanos can be used by child obesity researchers, by counselors and medical professionals during clinic visits as a screening tool and by educators as a tool to set goals for behavior change."

The suggested association is of particular concern in pregnant women where exposure to substances can cause harm to both the pregnant woman and fetus. The present study contributes to the minimal literature on factors associated with cannabis use during the preconception, prenatal, and postpartum periods including state legalization status, concurrent use of tobacco and e-cigarettes and adequacy of prenatal care.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis using combined survey data from the 2016-2018 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) collected from 36,391 women. Logistic regression was used to estimate the impact of state-legalization, adequacy of prenatal care, and other substance use on cannabis use during the preconception, prenatal, and post-partum periods.ResultsIn the preconception model, residence in a recreationally legal state (OR: 2.37; 95% CI, 2.04-2.75) or medically legal state (OR:3.32; 95% CI, 2.90-3.80) compared to a non-legal state was associated with higher odds of cannabis use. In the prenatal model, residence in a recreationally legal state was associated with higher odds of cannabis use (OR: 1.51; 95% CI, 1.29-1.79) whereas there was no association with residence in a medically legal state. Tobacco use including e-cigarettes and moderate prenatal alcohol use were also significantly associated with cannabis use.ConclusionRecreational cannabis legalization is associated with the use of cannabis prior to, during, and after pregnancy. Renewed clinical and policy efforts may be warranted to update prenatal substance use prevention programs, educational campaigns, and provider education as cannabis legalization evolves."

        "title": "Soil Application of Almond Residue Biomass Following Black Soldier Fly Larvae Cultivation",
        "abstract": "Insect farming has the potential to transform abundant residual biomass into feed that is compatible with non-ruminant animal production systems. However, insect cultivation generates its own by-products. There is a need to find valuable and sustainable applications for this material to enable commercial-scale insect farming. Soil application of by-products, which may be either basic broadcasting incorporation or part of a sustainable soil borne pest management practice, such as biosolarization, could offer an agricultural outlet. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of applying black soldier fly larvae (BSFL)-digested substrate as soil amendment for soil biosolarization and evaluate its impact on soil health. Sandy loam (SL) and sandy clay loam (CL) soils amended with BSFL-digested almond processing residues, i.e., spent pollinator hulls (SPH), at 2% dry weight (dw) were incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 15 days under a daily fluctuating temperature-interval (30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50\u00c2\u00b0C). The microbial respiration, pH, electrical conductivity, volatile fatty acids, macronutrients, and germination index using radish seeds (Raphanus sativus L.) were quantified to assess the soil health after amendment application. Incubation showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in electrical conductivity related to amendment addition and a decrease potentially linked to microbiological activity, i.e., sequestering of ions. Under aerobic conditions, SPH addition increased the CO2-accumulation by a factor of 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 compared to the non-amended soils in SL and CL, respectively. This increase further suggests a higher microbiological activity and that SPH behaves like a partially stabilized organic material. Under anaerobic conditions, CO2-development remained unchanged. BSFL-digested residues significantly increased the carbon, nitrogen, C/N, phosphate, ammonium, and potassium in the two soil types, replenishing soils with essential macronutrients. However, greenhouse trials with lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa) lasting 14 days resulted in a decrease of the biomass by 44.6 \u00c2\u00b1 35.4 and 35.2 \u00c2\u00b1 25.3% for SL and CL, respectively, compared to their respective non-amended soil samples. This reduction of the biomass resulted from residual phytotoxic compounds, indicating that BSFL-digested SPH have the potential to be used for biosolarization and as soil amendments, depending on the concentration and mitigation strategies. Application and environmental conditions must be carefully selected to minimize the persistence of soil phytotoxicity."

A recently postulated multi-population model was used to fit the transient pump-dump-probe and dump-induced depletion signals. We observed dump-induced depletion of the Lumi-R photoproduct, demonstrating that photoisomerization occurs via evolution on both the excited- and ground-state electronic surfaces. Excited-state equilibrium was not observed, as shown via the absence of a dump-induced excited-state \"Le Ch\u00c3\u00a2telier redistribution\" of excited-state populations. The importance of incorporating the inhomogeneous dynamics of Cph1 in interpreting measured transient data is discussed."

The effects of sustained consumption of dietary fructose compared with those of sustained glucose consumption on circulating apoCIII and large TRL particles have not been reported. We measured apoCIII concentrations and the TG and cholesterol content of lipoprotein subfractions separated by size in fasting and postprandial plasma collected from men and women (age: 54 \u00c2\u00b1 8 years) before and after they consumed glucose- or fructose-sweetened beverages for 10 weeks. The subjects consuming fructose exhibited higher fasting and postprandial plasma apoCIII concentrations than the subjects consuming glucose (p < 0.05 for both). They also had higher concentrations of postprandial TG in all TRL subfractions (p < 0.05, effect of sugar), with the highest increases occurring in the largest TRL particles (p < 0.0001 for fructose linear trend). Compared to glucose consumption, fructose consumption increased postprandial TG in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (p < 0.05, effect of sugar), especially in the smaller particles (p < 0.0001 for fructose linear trend). The increases of both postprandial apoCIII and TG in large TRL subfractions were associated with fructose-induced increases of fasting cholesterol in the smaller LDL particles. In conclusion, 10 weeks of fructose consumption increased the circulating apoCIII and postprandial concentrations of large TRL particles compared with glucose consumption."

        "abstract": "It is largely unknown whether and how whole food diets influence psychological stress and stress system responsiveness. To better understand the effects of whole diets on stress system responsiveness, we examined randomized control trial effects of a whole food diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) on cortisol responsiveness. A randomized, double-blind, controlled 8-week intervention was conducted in overweight and obese women to examine differentiated effects between two diet intervention groups: one based on the 2010 DGA and the other one based on a typical American diet (TAD). During a test week that occurred at baseline and again after 8 weeks of the intervention, we assessed salivary cortisol collected at 14 selected times across the day, including upon awakening, at bedtime, and during a test visit, and administered a standardized social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). There were no statistical differences between the diet groups in salivary cortisol at baseline or after 8 weeks. However, when considering differences in dietary carbohydrate, but not fat or protein, from the pre-intervention (habitual) to the intervention period, there was a significant (P = 0.0001) interaction between diet group, intervention week, saliva sample, and level of intervention-based change in carbohydrate consumption. This interaction was reflected primarily by an 8-week reduction in salivary cortisol during a period just prior to (log \u00ce\u201d -0.35 \u00c2\u00b1 0.12 nmol/L) and 30 (log \u00ce\u201d -0.49 \u00c2\u00b1 0.12 nmol/L), 60 (log \u00ce\u201d -0.50 \u00c2\u00b1 0.13 nmol/L), 90 (log \u00ce\u201d -0.51 \u00c2\u00b1 0.13 nmol/L), and 120 (log \u00ce\u201d -0.4476 \u00c2\u00b1 0.1231 nmol/L) min after the TSST in the DGA group having the highest increase (90th percentile) in carbohydrate consumption. In support of this finding, we also found significant (P < 0.05) and inverse linear associations between dietary carbohydrate and log salivary cortisol, with the strongest negative association (\u00ce\u00b2: -0.004 \u00c2\u00b1 0.0015, P = 0.009) occurring at 30 min post-TSST, but only in the DGA group and at week 9 of the intervention. Together, increasing dietary carbohydrate as part of a DGA-based diet may reduce circulating cortisol and dampen psychological stress-related cortisol responsiveness."

        "abstract": "Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) is a painful ocular disease in cattle that is characterized by the presence of a corneal ulcer and production losses. A common industry practice is to cover an affected eye with a piece of cloth to reduce exposure to face flies and ultraviolet light with the goal of alleviating pain, accelerating healing, and reducing spread. To study the efficacy of eye patches in the treatment of IBK, a group of 216 clinically normal Angus crossbred steers were followed between April and August 2019 and evaluated weekly for the development of IBK. Eyes of cattle that developed IBK were enrolled with a blocked randomization scheme based on ulcer severity score to receive either an eye patch (treatment group) or no eye patch (control group). All treatment and control group animals received parenteral antimicrobial and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatments and were housed in a pasture separated from the rest of the cohort for a maximum of 28 d or until clinical cure. Corneal ulcer areas were measured, and body weights were recorded twice weekly for steers in the treatment and control groups. Weights of all steers in the cohort were recorded three times during the trial period. The primary outcome, rate of corneal ulcer healing, was higher (P = 0.001) for lesions in eyes receiving an eye patch as determined by a linear mixed model that controlled for ulcer severity score at enrollment and previous IBK in the opposite eye. Median corneal ulcer healing time was 10 (IQR [Interquartile range] 7-17) d for patched eyes vs. 14 (IQR 7-21) d for unpatched eyes. In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for severity score at diagnosis, the hazard ratio for ulcer healing was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.02-2.56, P = 0.042) for eyes that received a patch compared to eyes that did not. Among all 216 steers in the cohort, those that were diagnosed with IBK had a numerically higher average daily gain (ADG) (0.45 [\u00c2\u00b1SE 0.01] kg) vs. those that were not (0.42 [\u00c2\u00b1SE 0.12] kg; P = 0.06). In enrolled steers that received a patch, the secondary outcome ADG was 0.47 (\u00c2\u00b1SE 0.02) kg compared to 0.43 (\u00c2\u00b1SE 0.02) kg in controls (P = 0.22). Weight gain may have been confounded by pasture during the treatment period. Results of this trial support the use of this low-cost intervention; further investigation into possible reasons for observed differences in weight gain may be warranted."

        "abstract": "The aim of this work was to examine agronomic, compositional, and functional changes in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) grains from plants grown under low-to-moderate salinity stress in the greenhouse. Plants were grown in sodium chloride-containing soil (2 or 4 dS/m(2) electrical conductivity), which was imposed 4-weeks after transplant (called Seedling EC2 and EC4) or after the appearance of the anthers (called Anthesis EC2 and EC4). The former simulates field conditions while the latter permits observation of the isolated effect of salt on grain filling processes. Key findings of this study are the following: (i) Plants showed adaptive responses to prolonged salt treatment with no negative effects on grain weight or fertility. Seedling EC2 plants had more panicles and enhanced caryopsis dimensions, while surprisingly, Seedling EC4 plants did not differ from the control group in the agronomic parameters measured. (ii) Grain starch increased in Seedling EC4 (32.6%) and Anthesis EC2 (39%), respectively, suggesting a stimulatory effect of salt on starch accumulation. (iii) The salinity treatment of 2 dS/m(2) was better tolerated at anthesis than the 4 dS/m(2) treatment as the latter led to reduced grain weight (28.8%) and seed fertility (19.4%) and compensatory increases in protein (20.1%) and nitrogen (19.8%) contents. (iv) Although some salinity treatments led to changes in starch content, these did not alter starch fine structure, morphology, or composition. We observed no differences in reducing sugar and amylose content or starch granule size distribution among any of the treatments. The only alterations in starch were limited to small changes in thermal properties and glucan chain distribution, which were only seen in the Anthesis EC4 treatment. This similarity of compositional and functional features was supported by multivariate analysis of all variables measured, which suggested that differences due to treatments were minimal. Overall, this study documents the specific response of rice under defined conditions, and illustrates that the plasticity of plant response to mild stress is complex and highly context-dependent, even under greenhouse conditions in which other potential environmental stress impacts are minimized."

        "title": "Dynamic changes in the starch-sugar interconversion within plant source and sink tissues promote a better abiotic stress response",
        "abstract": "Starch is a significant store of sugars, and the starch-sugar interconversion in source and sink tissues plays a profound physiological role in all plants. In this review, we discuss how changes in starch metabolism can facilitate adaptive changes in source-sink carbon allocation for protection against environmental stresses. The stress-related roles of starch are described, and published mechanisms by which starch metabolism responds to short- or long-term water deficit, salinity, or extreme temperatures are discussed. Numerous examples of starch metabolism as a stress response are also provided, focusing on studies where carbohydrates and cognate enzymes were assayed in source, sink, or both. We develop a model that integrates these findings with the theoretical and known roles of sugars and starch in various species, tissues, and developmental stages. In this model, localized starch degradation into sugars is vital to the plant cold stress response, with the sugars produced providing osmoprotection. In contrast, high starch accumulation is prominent under salinity stress, and is associated with higher assimilate allocation from source to sink. Our model explains how starch-sugar interconversion can be a convergent point for regulating carbon use in stress tolerance at the whole-plant level."

Several studies have noted changes in complete blood count (CBC) parameters including decreases in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and increases in the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR). These changes could reflect immunosuppression and may contribute to decreased efficacy of immunotherapies used to treat cancer. We hypothesized that dogs would demonstrate decreased ALCs during a course of radiotherapy. A retrospective study was conducted on 203 dogs receiving definitive-intent radiotherapy. Demographic information, CBC values and details of the radiotherapy protocol were collected. The mean lymphocyte count pre-treatment was 1630.68\u00e2\u20ac\u2030cells/\u00ce\u00bcL (SD\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u20ac\u2030667.56) with a mean NLR of 3.66 (SD\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u20ac\u20304.53).

Lymphopenia grade increased in 33.5% of dogs and was significant (P = .03). The ALC decrease was not correlated with the volume irradiated (P = .27), but correlated with the irradiated volume:body weight ratio (P = .03). A subset of patients (n = 35) with additional CBCs available beyond the mid-treatment time point demonstrated significant and sustained downward trends in the ALC compared with baseline. Although severe lymphopenia was rare, these decreases, especially if sustained, could impact adjuvant therapy for their cancer."

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Ambient light levels are often considered to drive the evolution of eye form and function. Diel activity pattern is the main mechanism controlling the visual environment of teleost reef fish, with day-active (diurnal) fish active in well-illuminated conditions, whereas night-active (nocturnal) fish cope with dim light. Physiological optics predicts several specific evolutionary responses to dim-light vision that should be reflected in visual performance features of the eye. Results We analyzed a large comparative dataset on morphological traits of the eyes in 265 species of teleost reef fish in 43 different families. The eye morphology of nocturnal reef teleosts is characterized by a syndrome that indicates better light sensitivity, including large relative eye size, high optical ratio and large, rounded pupils. Improved dim-light image formation comes at the cost of reduced depth of focus and reduction of potential accommodative lens movement. Diurnal teleost reef fish, released from the stringent functional requirements of dim-light vision have much higher morphological and optical diversity than nocturnal species, with large ranges of optical ratio, depth of focus, and lens accommodation. Conclusions Physical characteristics of the environment are an important factor in the evolution and diversification of the vertebrate eye. Both teleost reef fish and terrestrial amniotes meet the functional requirements of dim-light vision with a similar evolutionary response of morphological and optical modifications. The trade-off between improved dim-light vision and reduced optical diversity may be a key factor in explaining the lower trophic diversity of nocturnal reef teleosts."

        "abstract": "Recent progress in retinal image acquisition techniques, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), combined with improved performance of adaptive optics (AO) instrumentation, has resulted in improvement in the quality of in vivo images of cellular structures in the outer layers of the human retina. Despite the significant progress in imaging cone and rod photoreceptor mosaics, visualization of cellular structures in the inner retina has been achieved only with extrinsic contrast agents that have not been approved for use with humans. In this paper we describe the main limiting factors in visualizing inner retinal cells and the methods we implemented to reduce their effects on images acquired with AO-OCT. These include improving the system point spread function (AO performance), monitoring of motion artifacts (retinal motion tracking), and speckle pattern reduction (temporal and spatial averaging). Results of imaging inner retinal morphology and the improvement offered by the new UC Davis AOOCT system with spatio-temporal image averaging are presented. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)."

        "abstract": "Inner and outer retinal morphology were quantified in vivo for 6 nonglaucomatous and 10 glaucomatous optic neuropathy patients. Custom, ultrahigh-resolution imaging modalities were used to evaluate segmented retinal layer thickness in 3D volumes (Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography), cone photoreceptor density (adaptive optics fundus camera), and the length of inner and outer segments of cone photoreceptors (adaptive optics-optical coherence tomography). Quantitative comparisons were made with age-matched controls, or by comparing affected and nonaffected retinal areas defined by changes in visual fields. The integrity of outer retinal layers on optical coherence tomography B-scans and density of cone photoreceptors were correlated with visual field sensitivity at corresponding retinal locations following reductions in inner retinal thickness. The photoreceptor outer segments were shorter and exhibited greater variability in retinal areas associated with visual field losses compared with normal or less affected areas of the same patient's visual field. These results demonstrate that nonglaucomatous and glaucomatous optic neuropathies are associated with outer retinal changes following long-term inner retinal pathology."

Compared to our previously reported spectral domain (spectrometer based) phase-variance (pv)-SDOCT system it has advantages of higher sensitivity, reduced fringe washout for high blood flow speeds and deeper penetration in choroid. High phase stability SSOCT imaging was achieved by using a computationally efficient phase stabilization approach. This process does not require additional calibration hardware and complex numerical procedures. Our phase stabilization method is simple and can be employed in a variety of SS-OCT systems.

Retinal expression of CCL2 increased just prior to a transient period of CCR2+ cell extravasation from the retinal vasculature. Proliferation of microglia and monocytes occurred concurrently; however, there was no indication of proliferation in either population until 72-96&nbsp;h after neurodegeneration began. Eliminating CCL2-CCR2 signaling blocked monocyte recruitment, but did not alter the extent of retinal degeneration.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that the immune response to photoreceptor degeneration includes both resident microglia and monocytes, even at very early times. Surprisingly, preventing monocyte infiltration did not block neurodegeneration, suggesting that in this model, degeneration is limited by cell clearance from other phagocytes or by the timing of intrinsic cell death programs. These results show monocyte involvement is not limited to disease states that overwhelm or deplete the resident microglial population and that interventions focused on modulating the peripheral immune system are not universally beneficial for staving off degeneration."

Canine pemphigus foliaceus (cPF) is one of the most common canine autoimmune skin diseases. OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of the BTKi PRN1008 in the treatment of cPF. ANIMALS: Four privately owned dogs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four dogs diagnosed with PF were administered BTKi PRN1008. Initial dosages approximated to 15&nbsp;mg/kg once daily, increased to twice daily if inadequate response was seen. Treatment continued for 20 weeks, attempting to decrease to every other day. Dogs were monitored with complete blood counts, serum biochemistry panels and urinalyses, and evaluated with a modified version of a validated human Pemphigus Disease Activity Index (cPDAI). Serum anti-desmocollin-1 (DSC-1) and desmoglein-1 (DSG-1) immunoglobulin (Ig)G titres were performed before and after the treatment period. Drug bound to target was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: All four dogs showed reduction in lesions and cPDAI score during the first two weeks of treatment. Three dogs continued to improve and sustained near complete remission by 20 weeks, at which point three responses were considered good and one fair. Final daily dosages were in the range 17-33&nbsp;mg/kg. Anti-DSC-1 IgG titre decreased dramatically in one dog, was undetectable in two and was uninterpretable in one dog. No dogs had detectable IgG to DSG1. A possible adverse event occurred in one dog. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: BTKi PRN1008 monotherapy may have some beneficial effects in some cases of cPF."

Such comparisons, however, are potentially confounded by two key effects: different brew temperatures necessarily change the extraction dynamics and potentially alter the resulting brew strength, and different consumption temperatures are well known to affect perceived flavor and taste. Here, we performed a systematic study of how extraction temperature affects the sensory qualities of full immersion coffee. The investigation used a 3 \u00c3\u2014 3 \u00c3\u2014 3 factorial design, with coffee from three different origins representing different post-harvest methods (washed, honey-processed, and wet-hulled), each roasted to three different levels (light, medium, and dark), and each brewed at three different temperatures (4 \u00c2\u00b0C, 22 \u00c2\u00b0C, and 92 \u00c2\u00b0C). All coffees were brewed to equilibrium, then diluted to precisely 2% total dissolved solids (TDS) and served at the same cold temperature (4 \u00c2\u00b0C). We find that four attributes exhibited statistically significant variations with brew temperature for all origins and roast levels tested, with bitter taste, sour taste, and rubber flavor all higher in hot brewed coffees, and floral flavor higher in cold brewed coffee. However, there were strong interactions with origin and roast, with several additional attributes significantly impacted by temperature for specific origins and roast levels. These results provide insight on how brew temperature can be used to modulate the flavor profile of full immersion coffee."

However, par-1 mutations do not cause failure to restrict the anterior PAR polarity complex to the same extent as mutations in the posteriorly localized PAR-2 protein. Further, it has been difficult to examine the role of PAR-1 in subsequent divisions due to the early defects in par-1 mutant embryos. Here we show that the PIG-1 kinase acts redundantly with PAR-1 to restrict the anterior PAR-3 protein for normal polarity in the one-cell embryo. By using a temperature sensitive allele of par-1, which exhibits enhanced lethality when combined with a pig-1 mutation, we have further explored roles for these genes in subsequent divisions. We find that both PIG-1 and PAR-1 regulate spindle orientation in the EMS blastomere of the four-cell stage embryo to ensure that it undergoes an asymmetric division. In this cell, PIG-1 and PAR-1 act in parallel pathways for spindle positioning, PIG-1 in the MES-1/SRC-1 pathway and PAR-1 in the Wnt pathway."

We hypothesized that NO homeostasis in the airway is important to control inflammation, which requires upregulation, of NOS2 protein expression by an NOS3-dependent mechanism.Materials or subjectsMice from a C57BL/6 wild-type, NOS1(-/-), NOS2(-/-), and NOS3(-/-) genotypes were used. All mice strains were systemically sensitized and exposed to filtered air or ovalbumin (OVA) aerosol for two weeks to create a subchronic model of allergen-induced airway inflammation.MethodsWe measured lung function, lung lavage inflammatory and airway epithelial goblet cell count, exhaled NO, nitrate and nitrite concentration, and airway NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3 protein content.ResultsDeletion of NOS1 or NOS3 increases NOS2 protein present in the airway epithelium and smooth muscle of air-exposed animals. Exposure to allergen significantly reduced the expression of NOS2 protein in the airway epithelium and smooth muscle of the NOS3(-/-) strain only. This reduction in NOS2 expression was not due to the replacement of epithelial cells with goblet cells as remaining epithelial cells did not express NOS2. NOS1(-/-) animals had significantly reduced goblet cell metaplasia compared to C57Bl/6 wt, NOS2(-/-), and NOS3(-/-) allergen-exposed mice.ConclusionThe airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells maintain a stable airway NO concentration under noninflammatory conditions. This \"homeostatic\" mechanism is unable to distinguish between NOS derived from the different constitutive NOS isoforms. NOS3 is essential for the expression of NOS2 under inflammatory conditions, while NOS1 expression contributes to allergen-induced goblet cell metaplasia."

Lung concentrations of NO and its amino acid precursor, L-arginine, are regulated by the relative expressions of the NO synthase (NOS) and arginase isoforms. Increased expression of arginase I and NOS2 occurs in murine models of allergic asthma and in biopsies of asthmatic airways. Although clinical trials involving the inhibition of NO-producing enzymes have shown mixed results, small molecule arginase inhibitors have shown potential as a therapeutic intervention in animal and cell culture models. Their transition to clinical trials is hampered by concerns regarding their safety and potential toxicity. In this review, we discuss the paradigm of arginase and NOS competition for their substrate L-arginine in the asthmatic airway. We address the functional role of L-arginine in inflammation and the potential role of arginase inhibitors as therapeutics."

Automated algorithm-based DMS dispersion plot data analysis method was applied for the first time to pre-process and separate 3-dimentional (3-D) DMS dispersion data. We previously demonstrated our AnalyzeIMS (AIMS) software was capable of analyzing complex gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (GC-DMS) data sets. In our present work, the AIMS software was able to easliy separate DMS dispersion data sets of five chemicals that are important in detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): 2-butanone, 2-propanone, ethyl acetate, methanol and ethanol. Identification of chemicals from mixtures, separation of chemicals from a mixture and prediction capability of the software were all tested. These automated algorithms may have potential applications in separation of chemicals (or ion peaks) from other 3-D data obtained by hybrid analytical devices such as mass spectrometry (MS). New algorithm developments are included as future considerations to improve the current numerical approaches to fingerprint chemicals (ions) from a significantly complicated dispersion plot. Comprehensive peak identifcation by DMS-MS, variations of the DMS data due to chemical concentration, gas phase ion chemistry, temperature and pressure of the drift gas are considered in future algorithm improvements."

The model is composed of 6 state variables representing amino acids, muscle protein, visceral protein, glucose, triglycerides, and fatty acids (FAs). Differential equations represent carbohydrate, amino acid, and FA uptake and output by tissues based on ATP creation and use for both lean and obese men. Model parameterization is based on data from previous studies. Results from sensitivity analyses indicate that model predictions of resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) are dependent on FA and glucose oxidation rates with the highest sensitivity coefficients (0.6, 0.8 and 0.43, 0.15, respectively, for lean and obese models). Metabolizable energy (ME) is influenced by ingested energy intake with a sensitivity coefficient of 0.98, and a phosphate-to-oxygen ratio by FA oxidation rate and amino acid oxidation rate (0.32, 0.24 and 0.55, 0.65 for lean and obese models, respectively). Simulations of previously published studies showed that the model is able to predict ME ranging from 6.6 to 9.3 with 0% differences between published and model values, and RQ ranging from 0.79 to 0.86 with 1% differences between published and model values. REEs >7 MJ/d are predicted with 6% differences between published and model values. Glucose oxidation increases by \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc0.59 mol/d, RQ increases by 0.03, REE increases by 2 MJ/d, and heat production increases by 1.8 MJ/d in the obese model compared with lean model simulations. Increased FA oxidation results in higher changes in RQ and lower relative changes in REE. These results suggest that because fat mass is directly related to REE and rate of FA oxidation, body fat content could be used as a predictor of RQ."

Research has largely treated the learning problem as one of identifying perceptual similarities among exemplars (typically posed, stereotyped facial configurations). However, recent meta-analyses and reviews converge to suggest that emotion categories are abstract, involving high-dimensional and situationally variable instances. In this paper we consult research on the development of abstract object categorization to guide hypotheses about how infants might learn abstract emotion categories because the two domains present infants with similar learning challenges. In particular, we consider how a developmental cascades framework offers opportunities to understand how and when young children develop emotion categories."

        "abstract": "Manganese-oxide minerals (MnOx) are widely distributed over the Earth's surface, and their geochemical cycling is globally important. A multicopper oxidase (MCO) MnxG protein from marine Bacillus bacteria plays an essential role in producing MnOx minerals by oxidizing Mn2+(aq) at rates that are 3 to 5 orders of magnitude faster than abiotic rates. The MnxG protein is isolated as part of a multiprotein complex denoted as \"Mnx\" that includes accessory protein subunits MnxE and MnxF, with an estimated stoichiometry of MnxE3F3G and corresponding molecular weight of \u00e2\u2030\u02c6211 kDa. Herein, we report successful expression and isolation of the MCO MnxG protein without the E3F3 hexamer. This isolated MnxG shows activity for Mn2+(aq) oxidation to form manganese oxides. The complement of paramagnetic Cu(II) ions in the Mnx protein complex was examined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Two distinct classes of type 2 Cu sites were detected. One class of Cu(II) site (denoted as T2Cu-A), located in the MnxG subunit, is identified by the magnetic parameters g\u00e2\u02c6\u00a5 = 2.320 and A\u00e2\u02c6\u00a5 = 510 MHz. The other class of Cu(II) sites (denoted as T2Cu-B) is characterized by g\u00e2\u02c6\u00a5 = 2.210 and A\u00e2\u02c6\u00a5 = 615 MHz and resides in the putative hexameric MnxE3F3 subunit. These different magnetic properties correlate with the differences in the reduction potentials of the respective Cu(II) centers. These studies provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of manganese biomineralization."

        "abstract": "The bacterial manganese oxidase MnxG of the Mnx protein complex is unique among multicopper oxidases (MCOs) in carrying out a two-electron metal oxidation, converting Mn(II) to MnO2 nanoparticles. The reaction occurs in two stages: Mn(II) \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Mn(III) and Mn(III) \u00e2\u2020\u2019 MnO2. In a companion study , we show that the electron transfer from Mn(II) to the low-potential type 1 Cu of MnxG requires an activation step, likely forming a hydroxide bridge at a dinuclear Mn(II) site. Here we study the second oxidation step, using pyrophosphate (PP) as a Mn(III) trap. PP chelates Mn(III) produced by the enzyme and subsequently allows it to become a substrate for the second stage of the reaction. EPR spectroscopy confirms the presence of Mn(III) bound to the enzyme. The Mn(III) oxidation step does not involve direct electron transfer to the enzyme from Mn(III), which is shown by kinetic measurements to be excluded from the Mn(II) binding site. Instead, Mn(III) is proposed to disproportionate at an adjacent polynuclear site, thereby allowing indirect oxidation to Mn(IV) and recycling of Mn(II). PP plays a multifaceted role, slowing the reaction by complexing both Mn(II) and Mn(III) in solution, and also inhibiting catalysis, likely through binding at or near the active site. An overall mechanism for Mnx-catalyzed MnO2 production from Mn(II) is presented."

        "abstract": "The active site of the [FeFe] hydrogenase (HydA1), the H-cluster, is a 6-Fe cofactor that contains CO and CN- ligands. It undergoes several different oxidation and protonation state changes in its catalytic cycle to metabolize H2. Among them, the well-known Hox state and the recently identified Hhyd state are thought to be directly involved in H2 activation and evolution, and they are both EPR active with net spin S = 1/2. Herein, we report the pulse electronic paramagnetic spectroscopic investigation of these two catalytic states in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HydA1 ( CrHydA1). Using an in vitro biosynthetic maturation approach, we site-specifically installed 13C into the CO or CN- ligands and 57Fe into the [2Fe]H subcluster of the H-cluster in order to measure the hyperfine couplings to these magnetic nuclei. For Hox, we measured 13C hyperfine couplings (13CO aiso of 25.5, 5.8, and 4.5 MHz) corresponding to all three CO ligands in the H-cluster. We also observed two 57Fe hyperfine couplings (57Fe aiso of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc17 and 5.7 MHz) arising from the two Fe atoms in the [2Fe]H subcluster. For Hhyd, we only observed two distinct 13CO hyperfine interactions (13CO aiso of 0.16 and 0.08 MHz) and only one for 13CN- (13CN aiso of 0.16 MHz); the couplings to the 13CO/13CN- on the distal Fe of [2Fe]H may be too small to detect. We also observed a very small (<0.3 MHz) 57Fe HFI from the labeled [2Fe]H subcluster and four 57Fe HFI from the labeled [4Fe-4S]H subcluster (57Fe aiso of 7.2, 16.6, 28.2, and 35.3 MHz). These hyperfine coupling constants are consistent with the previously proposed electronic structure of the H-cluster at both Hox and Hhyd states and provide a basis for more detailed analysis."

We previously engineered myoglobin into a biosynthetic model of HCOs and demonstrated the critical role that Tyr serves in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To address the roles of Tyr and Trp in these oxidases, we herein report the preparation of the same biosynthetic model with the Tyr replaced by Trp and further demonstrate that Trp can also promote the ORR, albeit with lower activity. An X-ray crystal structure of the Trp variant shows a hydrogen-bonding network involving two water molecules that are organized by Trp, similar to that in the Tyr variant, which is absent in the crystal structure with the native Phe residue. Additional electron paramagnetic resonance measurements are consistent with the formation of a Trp radical species upon reacting with H2O2. We attribute the lower activity of the Trp variant to Trp's higher reduction potential relative to Tyr. Together, these findings demonstrate, for the first time, that Trp can indeed promote the ORR and provides a structural basis for the observation of varying activities. The results support a redox role for the conserved Trp in bd oxidase while suggesting that HCOs use Tyr instead of Trp to achieve higher reactivity."

        "abstract": "Ocular surface disorders, such as dry eye disease, ocular rosacea, and allergic conjunctivitis, are a heterogeneous group of diseases that require an interdisciplinary approach to establish underlying causes and develop effective therapeutic strategies. These diverse disorders share a common thread in that they involve direct changes in ocular surface chemistry as well as the rheological properties of the tear film and topographical attributes of the cellular elements of the ocular surface. Knowledge of these properties is crucial to understand the formation and stability of the preocular tear film. The study of interfacial phenomena of the ocular surface flourished during the 1970s and 1980s, but after a series of lively debates in the literature concerning distinctions between the epithelial and the glandular origin of ocular surface disorders during the 1990s, research into this important topic has declined. In the meantime, new tools and techniques for the characterization and functionalization of biological surfaces have been developed. This review summarizes the available literature regarding the physicochemical attributes of the ocular surface, analyzes the role of interfacial phenomena in the pathobiology of ocular surface disease, identifies critical knowledge gaps concerning interfacial phenomena of the ocular surface, and discusses the opportunities for the exploitation of these phenomena to develop improved therapeutics for the treatment of ocular surface disorders."

Twenty-six eyes of 21 client-owned dogs with PCED were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, vehicle control clinical trial and received topical netarsudil 0.02% (Rhopressa\u00c2\u00ae) or vehicle control twice daily (BID) for the first 4&nbsp;months. Then, all patients received netarsudil for the next 4 or 8&nbsp;months. Complete ophthalmic examination, ultrasonic pachymetry, Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography, and in vivo confocal microscopy were performed at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12&nbsp;months. Effect of netarsudil on central corneal thickness (CCT), percentage of cornea with edema, and endothelial cell density (ECD) were evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were used to compare corneal edema and clinical progression of eyes in netarsudil versus vehicle control groups. All dogs developed conjunctival hyperemia in at least one eye while receiving netarsudil. Unilateral transient reticulated intraepithelial bullae and stromal hemorrhage were observed respectively in 2 dogs in the netarsudil group. Two dogs showed persistently decreased tear production while receiving netarsudil, requiring topical immunomodulatory treatment. No significant differences in CCT, ECD, corneal edema or clinical progression were observed between netarsudil or vehicle treated eyes. When comparing efficacy of topical netarsudil BID and topical ripasudil 0.4% administered four times daily from our previous study, dogs receiving ripasudil had significantly less progression than those receiving netarsudil."

        "abstract": "Animals' sensory systems evolved to efficiently process information from their environmental niches. Niches often include irregular shapes and rough textures (e.g., jagged terrain, canopy outlines) that must be navigated to find food, escape predators, and master other fitness-related challenges. For most primates, vision is the dominant sensory modality and thus, primates have evolved systems for processing complicated visual stimuli. One way to quantify information present in visual stimuli in natural scenes is evaluating their fractal dimension. We hypothesized that sensitivity to complicated geometric forms, indexed by fractal dimension, is an evolutionarily conserved capacity, and tested this capacity in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Monkeys viewed paired black and white images of simulated self-similar contours that systematically varied in fractal dimension while their attention to the stimuli was measured using noninvasive infrared eye tracking. They fixated more frequently on, dwelled for longer durations on, and had attentional biases towards images that contain boundary contours with higher fractal dimensions. This indicates that, like humans, they discriminate between visual stimuli on the basis of fractal dimension and may prefer viewing informationally rich visual stimuli. Our findings suggest that sensitivity to fractal dimension may be a wider ability of the vertebrate vision system."

This may reflect an awareness of limited lifetime unique to humans, leading to a greater interest in maintaining social relationships at the expense of the non-social world in the face of limited cognitive and physical resources. Alternately, fundamental biological processes common to other primate species may direct preferential interest in social stimuli with increasing age. Inspired by a recent study that described a sustained interest in social stimuli but diminished interest in non-social stimuli in aged Barbary macaques, we carried out a conceptual replication to test whether old rhesus monkeys lost interest in non-social stimuli. Male and female macaques (Macaca mulatta; N = 243) 4-30 years old were tested with a food puzzle outfitted with an activity monitor to evaluate their propensity to manipulate the puzzle in order to free a food reward. We found no indication that aged monkeys were less interested in the puzzle than young monkeys, nor were they less able to solve it."

        "abstract": "Humans everyday experience of the world is influenced by our moods. Moods are consciously accessible affective states that extend over time that are characterized by their valence and arousal. They also likely have a long evolutionary heritage and serve as an important adaptive affective mechanism. When they become maladaptive or overly biased, pathological affective states such as depression can emerge. Despite the importance of moods for human experience, little is known about their causal neurobiological mechanisms. In humans, limitations related to methods and interpretations of the data prevent causal investigations into the origins of mood, highlighting the importance of animal models. Nonhuman primates that share key neuroanatomical, affective, and social features with humans will be essential to uncovering their foundation. Identifying and validating mood-like states in animals is, however, challenging not least because mood is a human construct requiring verbal communication. Here we outline a theoretical framework for animal models of human mood, drawing upon established psychological literature where it exists before reviewing the extant studies of non-human primate models of mood-like states."

To date, most existing research on adult plasticity has focused on how exteroceptive sensorimotor networks compensate for damage to preserve function. Interoceptive networks-those that represent and process sensory information about the body's internal state-are now recognized to be critical for a wide range of physiological and psychological functions from basic energy regulation to maintaining a sense of self, but the extent to which these networks remain plastic in adulthood has not been established. In this report, we used detailed histological analyses to pinpoint precise changes to gray matter volume in the interoceptive-allostatic network in adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) who received neurotoxic lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and neurologically intact control monkeys. Relative to controls, monkeys with ACC lesions had significant and selective unilateral expansion of the ventral anterior insula and significant relative bilateral expansion of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. This work demonstrates the capacity for neuroplasticity in the interoceptive-allostatic network which, given that changes included expansion rather than atrophy, is likely to represent an adaptive response following damage."

In both models, PAP-1 administration was started 12&nbsp;h after reperfusion.ResultsWe observed Kv1.3 staining on activated microglia in ischemic infarcts in mice, rats, and humans and found higher Kv1.3 current densities in acutely isolated microglia from the infarcted hemisphere than in microglia isolated from the contralateral hemisphere of MCAO mice. PAP-1 reduced microglia activation and increased neuronal survival in hypoxia-exposed hippocampal slices as effectively as minocycline. In mouse MCAO, PAP-1 dose-dependently reduced infarct area, improved neurological deficit score, and reduced brain levels of IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 and IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 without affecting IL-10 and brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) levels or inhibiting ongoing phagocytosis. The beneficial effects on infarct area and neurological deficit score were reproduced in rats providing confirmation in a second species.InterpretationOur findings suggest that Kv1.3 constitutes a promising therapeutic target for preferentially inhibiting \"M1-like\" inflammatory microglia/macrophage functions in ischemic stroke."

Genes identified by diurnal epigenetic changes in PWS mice overlapped rhythmic and PWS-specific genes in human brain and are enriched for PWS-relevant phenotypes and pathways. These results support the proposed evolutionary relationship between imprinting and sleep, and suggest possible chronotherapy in the treatment of PWS and related disorders."

        "abstract": "Previous research has shown that properties of network traffic (network fingerprints) can be exploited to extract information about the content of streaming multimedia, even when the traffic is encrypted. However, the existing attacks suffer from several limitations: (i) the attack process is time consuming, (ii) the tests are performed under nearly identical network conditions while the practical fingerprints are normally variable in terms of the end-to-end network connections, and (iii) the total possible video streams are limited to a small pre-known set while the performance against possibly larger databases remains unclear. In this paper, we overcome the above limitations by introducing a traffic analysis scheme that is both robust and efficient for variable bit rate (VBR) video streaming. To construct unique and robust video signatures with different compactness, we apply a (wavelet-based) analysis to extract the long and short range dependencies within the video traffic. Statistical significance testing is utilized to construct an efficient matching algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the identification algorithm using a large video database populated with a variety of movies and TV shows. Our experimental results show that, even under different real network conditions, our attacks can achieve high detection rates and low false alarm rates using video clips of only a few minutes. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag."

        "abstract": "We propose that organizations use a new framework of workday design to enhance the creativity of today's chronically overworked professionals. Although insights from creativity research have been integrated into models of work design to increase the stimulants of creativity (e.g., intrinsic motivation), this has not led to work design models that have effectively reduced the obstacles to creativity (e.g., workload pressures). As a consequence, creative output among professionals in high-workload contexts remains disappointing. In response, we offer a framework of work design that focuses on the design of entire workdays rather than the typical focus on designing either specific tasks or very broad job descriptions (e.g., as the job characteristics model in Hackman et al. 1975). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of \"mindless\" work (i.e., work that is low in both cognitive difficulty and performance pressures) as an integral part of this framework. We suggest that to enhance creativity among chronically overworked professionals, workdays should be designed to alternate between bouts of cognitively challenging and high-pressure work (as suggested in the original model by Hackman et al. 1975), and bouts of mindless work (as defined in this paper). We discuss the implications of our framework for theories of work design and creativity. \u00c2\u00a9 2006 INFORMS."

        "abstract": "Juvenile animals of many species engage in social play, but its functional significance is not well understood. This is especially true for a type of social play called fair play (Fp). Social play often involves behavioral patterns similar to adult behaviors (e.g., fighting, mating, and predatory activities), but young animals often engage in Fp behaviors such as role-reversals and self-handicapping, which raises the evolutionary problem of why Fp exists. A long-held working hypothesis, tracing back to the 19th century, is that social play provides contexts in which adult social skills needed for adulthood can be learned or, at least, refined. On this hypothesis, Fp may have evolved for adults to acquire skills for behaving fairly in the sense of equitable distribution of resources or treatment of others. We investigated the evolution of Fp using an evolutionary agent-based model of populations of social agents that learn adult fair behavior (Fb) by engaging in Fp as juveniles. In our model, adults produce offspring by accumulating resources over time through foraging. Adults can either behave selfishly by keeping the resources they forage or they can pool them, subsequently dividing the pooled resources after each round of foraging. We found that fairness as equitability was beneficial especially when resources were large but difficult to obtain and led to the evolution of Fp. We conclude by discussing the implications of this model, for developing more rigorous theory on the evolution of social play, and future directions for theory development by modeling the evolution of play."

Acute hepatitis B may be asymptomatic or cause clinical illness similar to infections caused by other hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis A to E). Most acute infections resolve without sequelae; however, progression to chronic infection may occur. The risk for developing chronic infection is inversely related to age at the time of acquisition of infection. The main morbidity and mortality from hepatitis B occur secondary to chronic hepatitis B infection, which may result in cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment of acute hepatitis B infection is primarily supportive. Children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis B infection should undergo routine monitoring for disease progression and to determine appropriate treatment initiation. Treatment includes antiviral agents and interferon and is usually managed by pediatric liver specialists. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination, which is universally recommended for infants in most industrialized nations as well as in many developing areas."

        "abstract": "RT-SHIV is a chimera of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing the reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) within the backbone of SIVmac239. It has been used in a non-human primate model for studies of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We and others have identified several mutations that arise in the \"foreign\" HIV-1 RT of RT-SHIV during in vivo replication. In this study we catalogued amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT and in regions of the SIV backbone with which RT interacts that emerged 30 weeks post-infection from seven RT-SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. The virus set points varied from relatively high virus load, moderate virus load, to undetectable virus load. The G196R substitution in RT was detected from 6 of 7 animals at week 4 post-infection and remained in virus from 4 of 6 animals at week 30. Virus from four high virus load animals showed several common mutations within RT, including L74V or V75L, G196R, L214F, and K275R. The foreign RT from high virus load isolates exhibited as much variation as that of the highly variable envelope surface glycoprotein, and 10-fold higher than that of the native RT of SIVmac239. Isolates from moderate virus load animals showed much less variation in the foreign RT than the high virus load isolates. No variation was found in SIVmac239 genes known to interact with RT. Our results demonstrate substantial adaptation of the foreign HIV-1 RT in RT-SHIV-infected macaques, which most likely reflects selective pressure upon the foreign RT to attain optimal activity within the context of the chimeric RT-SHIV and the rhesus macaque host."

        "abstract": "Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there was a high level of optimism based on observational studies and small controlled trials that treating hospitalized patients with convalescent plasma from COVID-19 survivors (CCP) would be an important immunotherapy. However, as more data from controlled trials became available, the results became disappointing, with at best moderate evidence of efficacy when CCP with high titers of neutralizing antibodies was used early in infection. To better understand the potential therapeutic efficacy of CCP, and to further validate SARS-CoV-2 infection of macaques as a reliable animal model for testing such strategies, we inoculated 12 adult rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 by intratracheal and intranasal routes. One day later, 8 animals were infused with pooled human CCP with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies (RVPN NT50 value of 3,003), while 4 control animals received normal human plasma. Animals were monitored for 7 days. Animals treated with CCP had detectable but low levels of antiviral antibodies after infusion. In comparison to the control animals, CCP-treated animals had similar levels of viral RNA in upper and lower respiratory tract secretions, similar detection of viral RNA in lung tissues by in situ hybridization, but lower amounts of infectious virus in the lungs. CCP-treated animals had a moderate, but statistically significant reduction in interstitial pneumonia, as measured by comprehensive lung histology. Thus overall, therapeutic benefits of CCP were marginal and inferior to results obtained earlier with monoclonal antibodies in this animal model. By highlighting strengths and weaknesses, data of this study can help to further optimize nonhuman primate models to provide proof-of-concept of intervention strategies, and guide the future use of convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other newly emerging respiratory viruses."

        "abstract": "Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response."

Targeted lesions in select basal ganglia (BG) structures also revealed a major role for nigrostriatal dopamine, the striatum, and the external globus pallidus (GPe) in regulating RLS-like movements, in particular pallidocortical projections from the GPe to the motor cortex. We further showed that pramipexiole, a dopamine agonist used to treat human RLS, reduced RLS-like movements. Taken together, our data show that BG-cortico-spinal, cerebello-rubro-spinal and A11 descending projections all contribute to the suppression of motor activity during sleep and sleep-wake transitions, and that disruption of these circuit nodes produces RLS-like movements. Taken together with findings from recent genomic studies in humans, our findings provide additional support for the concept that the anatomic and genetic etiological bases of RLS are diverse."

Previous studies that explored their potential effects on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relied either on proxies of external exposure or on questionnaires completed by the parents to identify autism-like behaviors but did not provide a clinical diagnosis of ASD.AimsWe studied the associations between prenatal biologic markers for exposure to organophosphate pesticides and the risk of having a child with ASD or other developmental concerns (ODC).MethodWe analyzed 203 mother-child pairs of the ongoing MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies - Learning Early Signs) mother-child cohort, which enrolls mothers who are either pregnant or planning a pregnancy and whose expected child has an elevated risk to develop ASD. Seven metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were assessed in repeated urine samples collected during pregnancy. At 36 months, children were assessed with intruments measuring cognitive function and adaptive behaviors, and with two gold-standard diagnostic instruments for ASD: the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. Children were classified in one of the following groups: ASD (n\u00e2\u20ac\u00af=\u00e2\u20ac\u00af46), ODC (n\u00e2\u20ac\u00af=\u00e2\u20ac\u00af55) and typically developing (TD, n\u00e2\u20ac\u00af=\u00e2\u20ac\u00af102).ResultsAfter adjustment for potential confounders, organophosphate metabolite concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of ASD or ODC when boys and girls were studied together. After stratification by sex, dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP) pregnancy concentration tended to be associated with an increased ASD risk among girls (OR for a doubling in the DMTP concentration: 1.64 (95%CI, 0.95; 2.82)) but not among boys (OR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.63; 1.11).DiscussionThis is the first study of clinically confirmed diagnoses of ASD that utilized repeated measurements of organophosphate metabolites during pregnancy to explore the associations between these pesticides and ASD risk in children. The association we observed among girls, as well as the lack of association in boys, need to be replicated in further studies with similar design and larger sample size. In light of the higher baseline risk for ASD in this cohort, generalizability to children lacking a first degree relative affected by ASD is unknown."

The epigenetic layer of DNA methylation shows dynamic developmental changes and molecular memory of in utero experiences, particularly in placenta, a fetal tissue discarded at birth. However, current array-based methods to identify novel ASD risk genes lack coverage of the most structurally and epigenetically variable regions of the human genome.ResultsWe use whole genome bisulfite sequencing in placenta samples from prospective ASD studies to discover a previously uncharacterized ASD risk gene, LOC105373085, renamed NHIP. Out of 134 differentially methylated regions associated with ASD in placental samples, a cluster at 22q13.33 corresponds to a 118-kb hypomethylated block that replicates in two additional cohorts. Within this locus, NHIP is functionally characterized as a nuclear peptide-encoding transcript with high expression in brain, and increased expression following neuronal differentiation or hypoxia, but decreased expression in ASD placenta and brain. NHIP overexpression increases cellular proliferation and alters expression of genes regulating synapses and neurogenesis, overlapping significantly with known ASD risk genes and NHIP-associated genes in ASD brain. A common structural variant disrupting the proximity of NHIP to a fetal brain enhancer is associated with NHIP expression and methylation levels and ASD risk, demonstrating a common genetic influence.ConclusionsTogether, these results identify and initially characterize a novel environmentally responsive ASD risk gene relevant to brain development in a hitherto under-characterized region of the human genome."

        "abstract": "The nuclear receptor ROR\u00ce\u00b3 is a major driver of autoimmune diseases and certain types of cancer due to its aberrant function in T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation and tumor cholesterol metabolism, respectively. Compound screening using the classic receptor-coactivator interaction perturbation scheme led to identification of many small-molecule modulators of ROR\u00ce\u00b3(t). We report here that inverse agonists/antagonists of ROR\u00ce\u00b3 such as VTP-43742 derivative VTP-23 and TAK828F, which can potently inhibit the inflammatory gene program in Th17 cells, unexpectedly lack high potency in inhibiting the growth of TNBC tumor cells. In contrast, antagonists such as XY018 and GSK805 that strongly suppress tumor cell growth and survival display only modest activities in reducing Th17-related cytokine expression. Unexpectedly, we found that VTP-23 significantly induces the cholesterol biosynthesis program in TNBC cells. Our further mechanistic analyses revealed that VTP-23 enhances the local chromatin accessibility, H3K27ac mark and the cholesterol master regulator SREBP2 recruitment at the ROR\u00ce\u00b3 binding sites, whereas XY018 exerts the opposite activities. Yet, they display similar inhibitory effects on circadian rhythm program. Similar distinctions and contrasting activities between TAK828F and SR2211 in their effects on local chromatin structure at Il17 genes were also observed. Together, our study shows for the first-time that structurally distinct ROR\u00ce\u00b3 antagonists possess different or even contrasting activities in tissue/cell-specific manner. Our findings also highlight that the activities at natural chromatin are key determinants of ROR\u00ce\u00b3 modulators' tissue selectivity."

In the present study, we analyzed gamma oscillations of pulvinar neurons in the monkeys during a delayed non-matching to sample task, in which monkeys were required to discriminate 4 categories of visual stimuli (snakes, monkey faces, monkey hands and simple geometrical patterns). Gamma oscillations of pulvinar neuronal activity were analyzed in three phases around the stimulus onset (Pre-stimulus: 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2030ms before stimulus onset; Early: 0-200\u00e2\u20ac\u2030ms after stimulus onset; and Late: 300-500\u00e2\u20ac\u2030ms after stimulus onset). The results showed significant increases in mean strength of gamma oscillations in the Early phase for snakes and the Late phase for monkey faces, but no significant differences in ratios and frequencies of gamma oscillations among the 3 phases. The different periods of stronger gamma oscillations provide neurophysiological evidence that is consistent with other studies indicating that primates can detect snakes very rapidly and also cue in to faces for information. Our results are suggestive of different roles of gamma oscillations in the pulvinar: feedforward processing for images of snakes and cortico-pulvinar-cortical integration for images of faces."

Using individual item scores from the Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised, we examined which current symptoms of autism differed in boys with FXS relative to same-aged boys diagnosed with nonsyndromic ASD. In addition, different subsamples of participants were matched on autism diagnostic status and severity of autism symptoms. Between-group comparisons revealed that boys with FXS showed significantly less impairment in Social Smiling than did age-, diagnostic-, and severity-matched boys with nonsyndromic ASD. Severity-matched boys with FXS showed more impairment in complex mannerisms than did boys with nonsyndromic ASD. Behavioral differences between FXS and nonsyndromic ASD may be of theoretical importance in understanding the causes and correlates of ASD in FXS and in developing and implementing appropriate treatments."

Current practice to characterize liquefaction potential uses standard or oversized penetrometers and case-history based relationships developed for clean sands. This assumes that a well-graded soil will behave in a similar manner to a clean sand when subjected to cyclic loading. A series of centrifuge tests on coarse-grained soil mixtures was conducted at the UC Davis Center for Geotechnical Modeling to study the effects of soil gradation on liquefaction potential and dynamic response. Four uniformly-graded soils with mean grain diameters (D50) ranging from 0.18 to 2.58 mm were used to construct five soil mixtures: two uniformly-graded, two gap-graded and one well-graded. All base soils were deposited in an alluvial environment and were not crushed during processing; thus, any variations in minerology or particle shape are assumed to be consistent with natural deposition. Centrifuge models of each mixture were prepared loose (relative density (DR) < 50%) and shaken with 15 sequential uniform sine wave loading events of varying peak base acceleration (PBA). High frequency dynamic measurements were obtained during loading to track the mixtures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dynamic response. Densification was tracked using both high frequency data and physical measurements. The high hydraulic conductivity of the coarsest, uniformly-graded mixture prevented significant excess pore pressure generation (i.e. \u00ce\u201du \u00e2\u2030\u02c6 , defined as liquefaction); however, liquefaction was induced in all other mixtures despite variations in particle size due to lower hydraulic conductivity. Furthermore, the well-graded mixture exhibited a stronger dilative tendency than the clean sand due to its increased packing efficiency."

Effective, evidence-based interventions for HF prevention and management are needed to improve patient longevity, symptom control, and quality of life. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet interventions can have a positive impact for HF patients. However, the absence of a consensus for comprehensive dietary guidelines and for pragmatic evidence limits the ability of health care providers to implement clinical recommendations. The refinement of medical nutrition therapy through precision nutrition approaches has the potential to reduce the burden of HF, improve clinical care, and meet the needs of diverse patients. The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence related to HF dietary recommendations including DASH diet nutritional interventions and to develop initial recommendations for DASH diet implementation in outpatient HF management. Articles involving human studies were obtained using the following search terms: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH diet), diet pattern, diet, metabolism, and heart failure. Only full-text articles written in English were included in this review. As DASH nutritional interventions have been proposed, limitations of these studies are the small sample size and non-randomization of interventions, leading to less reliable evidence. Randomized controlled interventions are needed to offer definitive evidence related to the use of the DASH diet in HF management."

Diet ID\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a novel, rapid assessment method that uses an image-based algorithm to identify dietary patterns and estimate nutrient intake. The purpose of this analysis was to explore the criterion validity between Diet ID\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 and additional measures of dietary intake. Methods: This prospective cohort study (n = 42) collected dietary information using Diet ID\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR), plasma carotenoid concentrations, and the Veggie Meter\u00c2\u00ae to estimate carotenoid levels in the skin. Results: There were significant correlations between Diet ID\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 and NDSR for diet quality, calories, carbohydrates, protein, fiber, and cholesterol. Vitamin A and carotenoid intake were significantly correlated, with the exception of \u00ce\u00b1-carotene and lycopene. Significant correlations were observed for calcium, folate, iron, sodium, potassium, Vitamins B2, B3, B6, C, and E. Skin carotenoid scores and plasma carotenoids were correlated with carotenoid intake from Diet ID\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. Conclusions: Diet ID\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 may be a useful tool in nutrition research as a less time-intensive and minimally burdensome dietary data collection method for both participants and researchers."

        "abstract": "Functionalization of nanocrystals is essential for their practical application, but synthesis on nanocrystal surfaces is limited by incompatibilities with certain key reagents. The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition is among the most useful methods for ligating molecules to surfaces, but has been largely useless for semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) because Cu+ ions quickly and irreversibly quench QD fluorescence. To discover nonquenching synthetic conditions for Cu-catalyzed click reactions on QD surfaces, we developed a combinatorial fluorescence assay to screen >2000 reaction conditions to maximize cycloaddition efficiency while minimizing QD quenching. We identify conditions for complete coupling without significant quenching, which are compatible with common QD polymer surfaces and various azide/alkyne pairs. Based on insight from the combinatorial screen and mechanistic studies of Cu coordination and quenching, we find that superstoichiometric concentrations of Cu can promote full coupling if accompanied by ligands that selectively compete with the Cu from the QD surface but allow it to remain catalytically active. Applied to the conjugation of a K+ channel-specific peptidyl toxin to CdSe/ZnS QDs, we synthesize unquenched QD conjugates and image their specific and voltage-dependent affinity for K+ channels in live cells."

        "abstract": "A drug that blocks the cardiac myocyte voltage-gated K+ channels encoded by the human Ether-\u00c3\u00a0-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) carries a potential risk of long QT syndrome and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, including Torsade de Points Interestingly, certain hERG blockers can also facilitate hERG activation to increase hERG currents, which may reduce proarrhythmic potential. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the facilitation effect of hERG blockers remains unclear. The hallmark feature of the facilitation effect by hERG blockers is that a depolarizing preconditioning pulse shifts voltage-dependence of hERG activation to more negative voltages. Here we utilize a D540K hERG mutant to study the mechanism of the facilitation effect. D540K hERG is activated by not only depolarization but also hyperpolarization. This unusual gating property enables tests of the mechanism by which voltage induces facilitation of hERG by blockers. With D540K hERG, we find that nifekalant, a hERG blocker and Class III antiarrhythmic agent, blocks and facilitates not only current activation by depolarization but also current activation by hyperpolarization, suggesting a shared gating process upon depolarization and hyperpolarization. Moreover, in response to hyperpolarizing conditioning pulses, nifekalant facilitates D540K hERG currents but not wild-type currents. Our results indicate that induction of facilitation is coupled to pore opening, not voltage per se We propose that gated access to the hERG central cavity underlies the voltage-dependence of induction of facilitation. This study identifies hERG channel pore gate opening as the conformational change facilitated by nifekalant, a clinically important antiarrhythmic agent. Significance Statement Nifekalant is a clinically important antiarrhythmic agent and a hERG blocker which can also facilitate voltage-dependent activation of hERG channels after a preconditioning pulse. Here we show that the mechanism of action of the preconditioning pulse is to open a conductance gate to enable drug access to a facilitation site. Moreover, we find that facilitation increases hERG currents by altering pore dynamics, rather than acting through voltage sensors."

The improvement of horticultural traits by 300\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years of breeding has enabled the global expansion of strawberry production. Here, we describe the genomic history of strawberry domestication from the earliest hybrids to modern cultivars. We observed a significant increase in heterozygosity among interspecific hybrids and a decrease in heterozygosity among domesticated descendants of those hybrids. Selective sweeps were found across the genome in early and modern phases of domestication-59-76% of the selectively swept genes originated in the three less dominant ancestral subgenomes. Contrary to the tenet that genetic diversity is limited in cultivated strawberry, we found that the octoploid species harbor massive allelic diversity and that F. \u00c3\u2014 ananassa harbors as much allelic diversity as either wild founder. We identified 41.8\u00e2\u20ac\u2030M subgenome-specific DNA variants among resequenced wild and domesticated individuals. Strikingly, 98% of common alleles and 73% of total alleles were shared between wild and domesticated populations. Moreover, genome-wide estimates of nucleotide diversity were virtually identical in F. chiloensis,F. virginiana, and F. \u00c3\u2014 ananassa (\u00cf\u20ac\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.0059-0.0060). We found, however, that nucleotide diversity and heterozygosity were significantly lower in modern F. \u00c3\u2014 ananassa populations that have experienced significant genetic gains and have produced numerous agriculturally important cultivars."

To mimic these conditions, Lactobacillus plantarum was grown in a carbon-limited retentostat with complete biomass retention. The physiology of extremely slow-growing L. plantarum--as studied by genome-scale modeling and transcriptomics--was fundamentally different from that of stationary-phase cells. Stress resistance mechanisms were not massively induced during transition to extremely slow growth. The energy-generating metabolism was remarkably stable and remained largely based on the conversion of glucose to lactate. The combination of metabolic and transcriptomic analyses revealed behaviors involved in interactions with the environment, more particularly with plants: production of plant hormones or precursors thereof, and preparedness for the utilization of plant-derived substrates. Accordingly, the production of compounds interfering with plant root development was demonstrated in slow-growing L. plantarum. Thus, conditions of slow growth and limited substrate availability seem to trigger a plant environment-like response, even in the absence of plant-derived material, suggesting that this might constitute an intrinsic behavior in L. plantarum."

For example, Gary Sandefur, Jennifer Eggerling-Boeck, and Hyunjoon Park (2005) and David Ellwood and Thomas Kane (2000) show that parental education and family income are positively correlated with the probability that a young adult will pursue postsecondary education, and Tom Hertz (2005) estimates that a son born into a family whose income is in the top 10 percent of the income distribution is twenty-three times more likely to end up in the top 10 percent as an adult than a son born into the bottom 10 percent. Over the past thirty years, several social and economic changes may have altered the impact of parents on the success with which their children approach adulthood. In this chapter, we look at whether the importance of family background has changed over time. We compare various \"markers\" of adulthood for two groups who were coming of age in the mid-1970s and early 1990s. We look at whether early adult income levels, educational attainment, and the probability of starting one's own family differ by parental income and education, and we ask how these differences have changed over time. Knowing the extent to which family influences are changing is an important part of understanding why today's youth are taking longer to reach traditional markers of adulthood than previous generations. There may be important policy considerations as well. For example, if the association between parental income and the economic success of their children is becoming stronger over time, and if this association is due to the changing impact of income itself rather than the effects of other family characteristics correlated with income, then policies aimed at increasing the financial resources of poor families may also affect trends in outcomes for youths. We come to three conclusions. First, a successful transition to adulthood differs markedly across individuals who grew up in high- and lowincome families and with high- and low-educated parents.1 Second, there is little evidence that the influence of characteristics associated with parental income has changed over time. An exception is that those who grew up in high-income families seem to be delaying childbearing more than they did in the past. Third, the relationship between young adults' education and that of their parents appears to have become stronger over time. This is in marked contrast to the lack of a significant change between parental education and the next generation's income, and it is somewhat surprising given the large increases in the wage returns to schooling that took place over this period. \u00c2\u00a9 2007 by Russell Sage Foundation.

We sought to examine predictors of nonadherence in a multicenter randomized trial of 971 children with acute gastroenteritis receiving a 5-day oral course of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or placebo. Adherence, defined as consuming all doses of the product, was reported by the parents and recorded during daily follow-up contacts. Of 943 patients with follow-up data, 766 (81.2%) were adherent. On multivariate analysis, older age (OR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.00-1.43), increased vomiting duration (OR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05-1.45), higher dehydration score (OR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.42), and hospitalization following ED discharge (OR 4.16, 95% CI: 1.21--14.30) were factors associated with nonadherence; however, those with highest severity scores were more likely to adhere (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.95).

Although in a recent ruling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned CPC from certain products and requested more data on BAK's efficacy and safety profile, QUATS, in general, and CPC and BAK, in particular, continue to be used in personal health care, food, and pharmaceutical and cleaning industries.ObjectivesWe aimed to assess CPC's effects on mitochondrial toxicity and endocrine disruption in vitro.MethodMitochondrial O2 consumption and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis rates of osteosarcoma cybrid cells were measured before and after CPC and BAK treatment. Antiestrogenic effects of the compounds were measured by a luciferase-based assay using recombinant human breast carcinoma cells (VM7Luc4E2, ERalpha-positive).ResultsCPC inhibited both mitochondrial O2 consumption [half\u00e2\u20ac\u2030maximal\u00e2\u20ac\u2030inhibitory\u00e2\u20ac\u2030concentration\u00e2\u20ac\u2030(IC50): 3.8\u00ce\u00bcM] and ATP synthesis (IC50: 0.9\u00ce\u00bcM), and additional findings supported inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 as the underlying mechanism for these effects. In addition, CPC showed concentration-dependent antiestrogenic activity half maximal effective concentration [(EC50): 4.5\u00ce\u00bcM)]. BAK, another antimicrobial QUATS that is structurally similar to CPC, and the pesticide rotenone, a known complex 1 inhibitor, also showed mitochondrial inhibitory and antiestrogenic effects. In all three cases, there was overlap of the antiestrogenic activity with the mitochondrial inhibitory activity.ConclusionsMitochondrial inhibition in vitro occurred at a CPC concentration that may be relevant to human exposures. The antiestrogenic activity of CPC, BAK, rotenone, and triclosan may be related to their mitochondrial inhibitory activity. Our findings support the need for additional research on the mitochondrial inhibitory and antiestrogenic effects of QUATS, including CPC and BAK. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1404."

A bacterial avirulence gene was cloned by constructing a cosmid library from an avirulent P. syringae pv. tomato race, conjugating the recombinants into a strain of P. syringae pv. maculicola virulent on a tomato cultivar containing Pto, and screening for those clones that converted the normally virulent phenotype to avirulence. The cloned gene, designated avrPto, reduced multiplication of P. syringae pv. tomato transconjugants specifically on Pto tomato lines, as demonstrated by bacterial growth curve analyses. Analysis of F2 populations revealed cosegregation of resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato transconjugants carrying avrPto with resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato race 0. Surprisingly, mutation of avrPto in P. syringae pv. tomato race 0 does not eliminate the avirulent phenotype of race 0, suggesting that additional, as yet uncharacterized, avirulence genes and/or resistance genes may contribute to specificity in the avrPto-Pto interaction. Genetic analysis indicates that this resistance gene(s) would be tightly linked to Pto. Interestingly, P. syringae pv. glycinea transconjugants carrying avrPto elicit a typical hypersensitive resistant response in the soybean cultivar Centennial, suggesting conservation of Pto function between two crop plants, tomato and soybean."

        "abstract": "Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW), caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), is the most devastating disease of banana in east and central Africa. The spread of BXW threatens the livelihood of millions of African farmers who depend on banana for food security and income. There are no commercial chemicals, biocontrol agents or resistant cultivars available to control BXW. Here, we take advantage of the robust resistance conferred by the rice pattern-recognition receptor (PRR), XA21, to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We identified a set of genes required for activation of Xa21-mediated immunity (rax) that were conserved in both Xoo and Xcm. Based on the conservation, we hypothesized that intergeneric transfer of Xa21 would confer resistance to Xcm. We evaluated 25 transgenic lines of the banana cultivar 'Gonja manjaya' (AAB) using a rapid bioassay and 12 transgenic lines in the glasshouse for resistance against Xcm. About 50% of the transgenic lines showed complete resistance to Xcm in both assays. In contrast, all of the nontransgenic control plants showed severe symptoms that progressed to complete wilting. These results indicate that the constitutive expression of the rice Xa21 gene in banana results in enhanced resistance against Xcm. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the feasibility of PRR gene transfer between monocotyledonous species and provides a valuable new tool for controlling the BXW pandemic of banana, a staple food for 100&nbsp;million people in east Africa."

Here, we identify the minimal sufficient statistic for their prediction (the set of causal states), calculate the historical memory capacity required to store those states (statistical complexity), delineate what information is predictable (excess entropy), and decompose the entropy of a single measurement into that shared with the past, future, or both. The causal state equivalence relation defines a new subclass of renewal processes with a finite number of causal states despite having an unbounded interevent count distribution. We use the resulting formulae to analyze the output of the parametrized Simple Nonunifilar Source, generated by a simple two-state hidden Markov model, but with an infinite-state \u00ce\u00b5-machine presentation. All in all, the results lay the groundwork for analyzing more complex processes with infinite statistical complexity and infinite excess entropy."

This allows one to precisely determine Demon functional thermodynamic operating regimes, when previous methods either misclassify or simply fail due to approximations they invoke. This reveals that these Demons are more functional than previous candidates. They too behave either as engines, lifting a mass against gravity by extracting energy from a single heat reservoir, or as Landauer erasers, consuming external work to remove information from a sequence of binary symbols by decreasing their individual uncertainty. Going beyond these, our Demon exhibits a new functionality that erases bits not by simply decreasing individual-symbol uncertainty, but by increasing inter-bit correlations (that is, by adding temporal order) while increasing single-symbol uncertainty. In all cases, but especially in the new erasure regime, exactly accounting for informational correlations leads to tight bounds on Demon performance, expressed as a refined Second Law of thermodynamics that relies on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy for dynamical processes and not on changes purely in system configurational entropy, as previously employed. We rigorously derive the refined Second Law under minimal assumptions and so it applies quite broadly - for Demons with and without memory and input sequences that are correlated or not. We note that general Maxwellian Demons readily violate previously proposed, alternative such bounds, while the current bound still holds. As such, it broadly describes the minimal energetic cost of any computation by a thermodynamic system."

We demonstrate three modalities of information flow from time series X\r\nto time series Y. Intrinsic information flow exists when the past of X is\r\nindividually predictive of the present of Y, independent of Y's past; this is\r\nmost commonly considered information flow. Shared information flow exists when\r\nX's past is predictive of Y's present in the same manner as Y's past; this\r\noccurs due to synchronization or common driving, for example. Finally,\r\nsynergistic information flow occurs when neither X's nor Y's pasts are\r\npredictive of Y's present on their own, but taken together they are. The two\r\nmost broadly-employed information-theoretic methods of quantifying information\r\nflow---time-delayed mutual information and transfer entropy---are both\r\nsensitive to a pair of these modalities: time-delayed mutual information to\r\nboth intrinsic and shared flow, and transfer entropy to both intrinsic and\r\nsynergistic flow.

Quadtree is a hierarchical data structure that is computationally attractive for adaptive numerical simulations. Mesh generation and adaptive refinement of quadtree meshes is straight-forward. However, finite elements are non-conforming on quadtree meshes due to level-mismatches between adjacent elements, which results in the presence of so-called hanging nodes. In this study, we use meshfree (natural-neighbor, nn) basis functions on a reference element combined with an affine map to construct conforming approximations on quadtree meshes. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed h-adaptive finite element method. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

        "abstract": "PREdiction of NOn-LINear soil behavior (PRENOLIN) is an international benchmark aiming to test multiple numerical simulation codes that are capable of predicting nonlinear seismic site response with various constitutive models. One of the objectives of this project is the assessment of the uncertainties associated with nonlinear simulation of 1D site effects. A first verification phase (i.e., comparison between numerical codes on simple idealistic cases) will be followed by a validation phase, comparing the predictions of such numerical estimations with actual strongmotion recordings obtained at well-known sites. The benchmark presently involves 21 teams and 23 different computational codes. We present here the main results of the verification phase dealing with simple cases. Three different idealized soil profiles were tested over a wide range of shear strains with different input motions and different boundary conditions at the sediment/bedrock interface. A first iteration focusing on the elastic and viscoelastic cases was proved to be useful to ensure a common understanding and to identify numerical issues before pursuing the nonlinear modeling. Besides minor mistakes in the implementation of input parameters and output units, the initial discrepancies between the numerical results can be attributed to (1) different understanding of the expression \u00e2\u20ac\u0153input motion\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in different communities, and (2) different implementations of material damping and possible numerical energy dissipation. The second round of computations thus allowed a convergence of all teams to the Haskell\u00e2\u20ac\u201cThomson analytical solution in elastic and viscoelastic cases. For nonlinear computations, we investigate the epistemic uncertainties related only to wave propagation modeling using different nonlinear constitutive models. Such epistemic uncertainties are shown to increase with the strain level and to reach values around 0.2 (log10 scale) for a peak ground acceleration of 5 m=s2 at the base of the soil column, which may be reduced by almost 50% when the various constitutive models used the same shear strength and damping implementation."

Functional boundaries of cortical fields were directly related to myeloarchitectonic boundaries. Our results demonstrated that most of the neocortex is occupied by the visual, auditory, and somatosensory areas. Specifically, a small area 17, or primary visual area (V1), was located on the caudomedial pole of the neocortex; a large auditory cortex (AC), which contains the primary auditory area (A1) and other auditory fields, encompassed almost the entire temporal pole; and a large area 3b, or primary somatosensory area (S1), contained a complete representation of the contralateral body surface. Furthermore, these areas were coextensive with distinct myeloarchitectonic appearances. We also observed that the AC appeared to be disproportionately large in the prairie vole compared with other rodents. In addition, we found that both primary and nonprimary areas contained neurons that responded to auditory stimulation. Finally, we observed within S1 a disproportionate amount of cortex that was devoted to representing the perioral hairs and the snout and also that neurons within this representation had very small receptive fields. We discuss the expanded auditory domain and the enlarged representation of perioral hairs as they relate to the specialized life style of the prairie vole."

        "title": "Physiological stress biomarkers reveal stocking density effects in late larval Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus)",
        "abstract": "Suboptimal fish stocking densities in experimental systems may elicit stress responses that can affect experimental results. Fish species, age and size, water chemistry and flow, and physical characteristics of the experimental system (e.g., tank, cage) are among the parameters to be considered when determining stocking densities. However, systematic studies to define fish densities minimizing stress in experimental systems are rarely performed. This is particularly true when working with species of low aquaculture value or a non-model test species such as the Delta Smelt (. Hypomesus transpacificus). The aim of this study was to use physiological stress biomarkers to determine suitable fish densities for specific experimental vessels routinely used for this species. We maintained late larval Delta Smelt (60. days post-hatch; dph) over a period of 24. h, at five different densities: 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 fish per 8. L circular fish tank. We assessed whole body cortisol and transcriptomic biomarkers that lead to cortisol production to quantify stress levels. Both marker types delivered similar results. Cortisol levels were lowest at densities of 28 and 42 fish per tank, whereas lowest fish densities (7 and 14 fish per tank) evoked the highest stress levels. Genes such as Mineralocorticoid Receptor 1 and Glucocorticoid Receptor 2, as well as 11-Beta-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenase-2 depicted the lowest expression levels at stocking densities 28 and 42, and elevated expression levels for stocking densities 7 and 14. Our data support the observations that late larval Delta Smelt should be exposed, acclimated, and cultured in groups rather than as individuals or in low numbers. This study indicates the importance of adequately defining experimental conditions that minimize stress, specifically when stress is measured as an endpoint. In addition to classical cortisol measurements, responses of the transcriptome also appear suitable in assessing stress responses in fish, and in determining optimal holding conditions, particularly if short-term responses are the study focus.Statement of relevance. The study highlights the importance of evaluating stress in order to determine species-specific stocking densities. The results are thus relevant to a wide audience in the field of aquaculture and experimental biology."

The prevalent model is that the consistency in EC coupling in ventricular myocytes is due to the formation of fixed, tight junctions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the sarcolemma where Ca\u00c2\u00b2\u00e2\u0081\u00ba release is activated. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the SR is a structurally inert organelle in ventricular myocytes. Our data suggest that rather than being static, the SR undergoes frequent dynamic structural changes. SR boutons expressing functional ryanodine receptors moved throughout the cell, approaching or moving away from the sarcolemma of ventricular myocytes. These changes in SR structure occurred in the absence of changes in [Ca\u00c2\u00b2\u00e2\u0081\u00ba](i) during EC coupling. Microtubules and the molecular motors dynein and kinesin 1(Kif5b) were important regulators of SR motility. These findings support a model in which the SR is a motile organelle capable of molecular motor protein-driven structural changes."

        "abstract": "The L-type Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 is essential for arterial myocyte excitability, gene expression and contraction. Elevations in extracellular glucose (hyperglycemia) potentiate vascular L-type Ca2+ channel via PKA, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we find that cAMP synthesis in response to elevated glucose and the selective P2Y11 agonist NF546 is blocked by disruption of A-kinase anchoring protein 5 (AKAP5) function in arterial myocytes. Glucose and NF546-induced potentiation of L-type Ca2+ channels, vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow are prevented in AKAP5 null arterial myocytes/arteries. These responses are nucleated via the AKAP5-dependent clustering of P2Y11/ P2Y11-like receptors, AC5, PKA and CaV1.2 into nanocomplexes at the plasma membrane of human and mouse arterial myocytes. Hence, data reveal an AKAP5 signaling module that regulates L-type Ca2+ channel activity and vascular reactivity upon elevated glucose. This AKAP5-anchored nanocomplex may contribute to vascular complications during diabetic hyperglycemia."

Existing governance institutions and processes do not adequately address the risks of new technologies, nor do they give much consideration to the concerns of persons affected by them. Instead of treating technology, health, and the environment as discrete issues, Albert C.

Further, laws must encourage international cooperation and the development of common global standards, while allowing for flexibility and reassessment."

C57Bl/6J recipients were either left untreated or received the KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 (120 mg/kg/day). Histopathology and immunologic assays were performed on postoperative day 5 or 28.ResultsSubepithelial T-cell and macrophage infiltration on postoperative day 5, as seen in untreated allografts, was significantly reduced in the KCa3.1 and TRAM-34 groups. Also, systemic Th1 activation was significantly and Th2 mildly reduced by KCa3.1 knockout or blockade. After 28 days, luminal obliteration of tracheal allografts was reduced from 89%\u00c2\u00b121% in untreated recipients to 53%\u00c2\u00b126% (P=0.010) and 59%\u00c2\u00b133% (P=0.032) in KCa3.1 and TRAM-34-treated animals, respectively. The airway epithelium was mostly preserved in syngeneic grafts, mostly destroyed in the KCa3.1 and TRAM-34 groups, and absent in untreated allografts. Allografts triggered an antibody response in untreated recipients, which was significantly reduced in KCa3.1 animals. KCa3.1 was detected in T cells, airway epithelial cells, and myofibroblasts. TRAM-34 dose-dependently suppressed proliferation of wild-type C57B/6J splenocytes but did not show any effect on KCa3.1 splenocytes.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that KCa3.1 channels are involved in the pathogenesis of OAD and that KCa3.1 blockade holds promise to reduce OAD development."

Safety Pharmacology studies have provided new insights into the multi-target effects of many different classes of drugs and have been aided by the addition of robust new in vitro and in silico technology. The primary focus of Safety Pharmacology studies has been to determine the risk profile of drugs and drug candidates by assessing their effects on repolarization of the cardiac action potential. However, for decades experimental and clinical studies have described substantial and potentially detrimental effects of Na+ channel blockers in addition to their well-known conduction slowing effects. One such side effect, associated with administration of some Na+ channel blocking drugs is negative inotropy. This reduces the pumping function of the heart, thereby resulting in hypotension. Flecainide is a well-known example of a Na+ channel blocking drug, that exhibits strong rate-dependent block of INa and may cause negative cardiac inotropy. While the phenomenon of Na+ channel suppression and resulting negative inotropy is well described, the mechanism(s) underlying this effect are not. Here, we set out to use a modeling and simulation approach to reveal plausible mechanisms that could explain the negative inotropic effect of flecainide. We utilized the Grandi-Bers model [1] of the cardiac ventricular myocyte because of its robust descriptions of ion homeostasis in order to characterize and resolve the relative effects of QRS widening, flecainide off-target effects and changes in intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ homeostasis. The results of our investigations and predictions reconcile multiple data sets and illustrate how multiple mechanisms may play a contributing role in the flecainide induced negative cardiac inotropic effect."

        "abstract": "Osteoblasts perceive and respond to changes in their pericellular environment, including biophysical signals and oxygen availability, to elicit an anabolic or catabolic response. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) affects each arm of skeletal remodeling, with net anabolic or catabolic effects dependent upon duration of exposure. Similarly, the capacity of osteoblastic cells to perceive pericellular oxygen has a profound effect on skeletal mass and architecture, as mice expressing stable hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u00ce\u00b1 and -2\u00ce\u00b1 demonstrate age-dependent increases in bone volume per tissue volume and osteoblast number. Further, HIF levels and signaling can be influenced in an oxygen-independent manner. Because the cellular mechanisms involved in PTH regulation of the skeleton remain vague, we sought whether PTH could influence HIF-1\u00ce\u00b1 expression and HIF-\u00ce\u00b1-driven luciferase activity independently of altered oxygen availability. Using UMR106.01 mature osteoblasts, we observed that 100nM hPTH(1-34) decreased HIF-1\u00ce\u00b1 and HIF-responsive luciferase activity in a process involving heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and cyclic AMP but not intracellular calcium. Altering activity of the small GTPase RhoA and its effector kinase ROCK altered HIF-\u00ce\u00b1-driven luciferase activity in the absence and presence of PTH. Taken together, these data introduce PTH as a regulator of oxygen-independent HIF-1\u00ce\u00b1 levels through a mechanism involving cyclic AMP, Hsp90, and the cytoskeleton."

We present a novel ChIP-seq workflow for the archaea using the model organism Halobacterium salinarum sp. NRC-1 and demonstrate its application for mapping the genome-wide binding sites of natively expressed transcription factors. This end-to-end pipeline is the first protocol for ChIP-seq in archaea, with methods and tools for each stage from gene tagging to data analysis and biological discovery. Genome-wide binding sites for transcription factors with many binding sites (TfbD) are identified with sensitivity, while retaining specificity in the identification the smaller regulons (bacteriorhodopsin-activator protein). Chromosomal tagging of target proteins with a compact epitope facilitates a standardized and cost-effective workflow that is compatible with high-throughput immunoprecipitation of natively expressed transcription factors. The Pique package, an open-source bioinformatics method, is presented for identification of binding events. Relative to ChIP-Chip and qPCR, this workflow offers a robust catalog of protein-DNA binding events with improved spatial resolution and significantly decreased cost. While this study focuses on the application of ChIP-seq in H. salinarum sp. NRC-1, our workflow can also be adapted for use in other archaea and bacteria with basic genetic tools."

In the pediatric population, gunshot wounds (GSWs) and hangings are common mechanisms of pediatric suicide. Comorbid psychiatric illness is prevalent in this population, but psychiatric resource utilization after self-inflicted traumatic injury is not well characterized.MethodsWe analyzed patients <\u00e2\u20ac\u203018&nbsp;years old presenting to a level 1 pediatric trauma center after suicide attempt by GSW, hanging, or jumping from a height from 2009 to 2019. The primary outcome was psychiatric resource utilization. Secondary outcomes included prior emergency department (ED) visits to identify prior opportunities for intervention.ResultsOf 6538 pediatric trauma patients, there were 219 GSWs, 7 hangings, and 7 jumps from height, for a total of 233 patients. Of these, 14 presented following a suicide attempt (four GSWs, six hangings, and four jumps, total 6.0%). Half of these patients died due to their injuries. Self-inflicted GSWs had the highest mortality (75%). Most surviving patients were placed on involuntary psychiatric holds (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20305/7, 71.4%), and three patients were discharged to an inpatient psychiatric hospital (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20303/7, 42.9%). Five of the 14 patients had prior ED visits (35.7%), and of these, 60% were for suicidal ideation or suicide attempts.ConclusionsAmong pediatric trauma patients, suicide attempts are rare, but are highly lethal, with the highest mortality rate seen in self-inflicted GSWs. Psychiatric resource utilization is high both during and after the hospitalization. Prior ED visits may represent opportunities for depression and suicidality screening in this at-risk population."

        "abstract": "This study examines the effect of contingency on reward function in anxiety. We define contingency as the aspect of a situation in which the outcome is determined by one's action-that is, when there is a direct link between one's action and the outcome of the action. Past findings in adolescents with anxiety or at risk for anxiety have revealed hypersensitive behavioral and neural responses to higher value rewards with correct performance. This hypersensitivity to highly valued (salient) actions suggests that the value of actions is determined not only by outcome magnitude, but also by the degree to which the outcome is contingent on correct performance. Thus, contingency and incentive value might each modulate reward responses in unique ways in anxiety. Using fMRI with a monetary reward task, striatal response to cue anticipation is compared in 18 clinically anxious and 20 healthy adolescents. This task manipulates orthogonally reward contingency and incentive value. Findings suggest that contingency modulates the neural response to incentive magnitude differently in the two groups. Specifically, during the contingent condition, right-striatal response tracks incentive value in anxious, but not healthy, adolescents. During the noncontingent condition, striatal response is bilaterally stronger to low than to high incentive in anxious adolescents, while healthy adolescents exhibit the expected opposite pattern. Both contingency and reward magnitude differentiate striatal activation in anxious versus healthy adolescents. These findings may reflect exaggerated concern about performance and/or alterations of striatal coding of reward value in anxious adolescents. Abnormalities in reward function in anxiety may have treatment implications."

In this review, we focus on providing a framework for understanding how changes in facets of social development may correspond with changes in brain function. We argue that (1) distinct phases of social behavior emerge based on whether the organizing social force is the mother, peer play, peer integration, or romantic intimacy; (2) each phase is marked by a high degree of affect-driven motivation that elicits a distinct response in subcortical structures; (3) activity generated by these structures interacts with circuits in prefrontal cortex that guide executive functions, and occipital and temporal lobe circuits, which generate specific sensory and perceptual social representations. We propose that the direction, magnitude and duration of interaction among these affective, executive, and perceptual systems may relate to distinct sensitive periods across development that contribute to establishing long-term patterns of brain function and behavior."

        "abstract": "Childhood adversity is a leading transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, being associated with an estimated 31-62% of childhood-onset disorders and 23-42% of adult-onset disorders (Kessler et al., 2010). Major unresolved theoretical challenges stem from the nonspecific and probabilistic nature of the links between childhood adversity and psychopathology. The links are nonspecific because childhood adversity increases risk, through a range of mechanisms, for diverse forms of psychopathology and are probabilistic because not all individuals exposed to childhood adversity develop psychopathology. In this article, we propose a path forward by focusing on stress phenotypes, defined as biobehavioral patterns activated in response to stressors that can disrupt future functioning when persistent (e.g., reward seeking, social withdrawal, aggression). This review centers on the accumulating evidence that psychopathology appears to be more strongly predicted by behavior and biology during states of stress. Building on this observation, our theoretical framework proposes that we can model pathways from childhood adversity to psychopathology with greater specificity and certainty by understanding stress phenotypes, defined as patterns of behavior and their corresponding biological substrates that are elicited by stressors. This approach aims to advance our conceptualization of mediating pathways from childhood adversity to psychopathology. Understanding stress phenotypes will bring us closer to \"precision mental health,\" a person-centered approach to identifying, preventing, and treating psychopathology.

        "title": "Non-Ionotropic NMDA Receptor Signaling Drives Activity-Induced Dendritic Spine Shrinkage",
        "abstract": "The elimination of dendritic spine synapses is a critical step in the refinement of neuronal circuits during development of the cerebral cortex. Several studies have shown that activity-induced shrinkage and retraction of dendritic spines depend on activation of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR), which leads to influx of extracellular calcium ions and activation of calcium-dependent phosphatases that modify regulators of the spine cytoskeleton, suggesting that influx of extracellular calcium ions drives spine shrinkage. Intriguingly, a recent report revealed a novel non-ionotropic function of the NMDAR in the regulation of synaptic strength, which relies on glutamate binding but is independent of ion flux through the receptor (Nabavi et al., 2013). Here, we tested whether non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling could also play a role in driving structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Using two-photon glutamate uncaging and time-lapse imaging of rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, we show that low-frequency glutamatergic stimulation results in shrinkage of dendritic spines even in the presence of the NMDAR d-serine/glycine binding site antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7CK), which fully blocks NMDAR-mediated currents and Ca(2+) transients. Notably, application of 7CK or MK-801 also converts spine enlargement resulting from a high-frequency uncaging stimulus into spine shrinkage, demonstrating that strong Ca(2+) influx through the NMDAR normally overcomes a non-ionotropic shrinkage signal to drive spine growth. Our results support a model in which NMDAR signaling, independent of ion flux, drives structural shrinkage at spiny synapses.Significance statementDendritic spine elimination is vital for the refinement of neural circuits during development and has been linked to improvements in behavioral performance in the adult. Spine shrinkage and elimination have been widely accepted to depend on Ca(2+) influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) in conjunction with long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength. Here, we use two-photon glutamate uncaging and time-lapse imaging to show that non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling can drive shrinkage of dendritic spines, independent of NMDAR-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Signaling through p38 MAPK was required for this activity-dependent spine shrinkage. Our results provide fundamental new insights into the signaling mechanisms that support experience-dependent changes in brain structure."

By the late 1990s, published genetic work had largely concluded that archaic groups made no lasting genetic contribution to modern humans; less than a decade later, this conclusion was reversed following the successful DNA sequencing of an ancient Neanderthal. This reversal of consensus is noteworthy, but the reasoning behind it is not widely understood across all academic communities. There remains a communication gap between population geneticists and paleoanthropologists. In this review, we endeavor to bridge this gap by outlining how technological advancements, new statistical methods, and notable controversies ultimately led to the current consensus."

        "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging results need to replicate to inform sound models of human social cognition and its neural correlates. Introspection, the capacity to reflect on one's thoughts and feelings, is one process required for normative social cognition and emotional functioning. Engaging in introspection draws on a network of brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), middle temporal gyri (MTG), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Maturation of these regions during adolescence mirrors the behavioral advances seen in adolescent social cognition, but the neural correlates of introspection in adolescence need to replicate to confirm their generalizability and role as a possible mechanism. The current study investigated whether reflecting upon one's own feelings of sadness would activate and replicate similar brain regions in two independent samples of adolescents. Participants included 156 adolescents (50% female) from the California Families Project and 119 adolescent girls from the Pittsburgh Girls Study of Emotion. All participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while completing the same facial emotion-processing task at age 16-17\u00e2\u20ac\u2030years. Both samples showed similar whole-brain activation patterns when engaged in sadness introspection and when judging a nonemotional facial feature. Whole-brain activation was unrelated to ERQ scores in both samples. Neural responsivity to task manipulations replicated in regions recruited for socio-emotional (mPFC, PCC, MTG, TPJ) and attention (dorsolateral PFC, precentral gyri, superior occipital gyrus, superior parietal lobule) processing. These findings demonstrate robust replication of neural engagement during sadness introspection in two independent adolescent samples."

        "abstract": "There has been resistance to COVID-19 public health restrictions partly due to changes and reductions in work, resulting in financial stress. Psychological reactance theory posits that such restrictions to personal freedoms result in anger, defiance, and motivation to restore freedom. In an online study (N = 301), we manipulated the target of COVID-19 restrictions as impacting self or community. We hypothesized that (a) greater pandemic-related financial stress would predict greater reactance, (b) the self-focused restriction condition would elicit greater reactance than the community-focused restriction condition, (c) reactance would be greatest for financially-stressed individuals in the self-focused condition, and (d) greater reactance would predict lower adherence to social distancing guidelines. Independent of political orientation and sense of community, greater financial stress predicted greater reactance only in the self-focused condition; the community-focused condition attenuated this association. Additionally, greater reactance was associated with lower social distancing behavior. These findings suggest that economic hardship exacerbates negative responses to continued personal freedom loss. Community-focused COVID-19 health messaging may be better received during continued pandemic conditions."

Electrical and Ca2+-handling remodeling have been implicated in SAN dysfunction associated with heart failure, aging, and diabetes. Cardiomyocyte [Na+]i is also elevated in these diseases, where it contributes to arrhythmogenesis. Here, we sought to investigate the largely unexplored role of Na+ homeostasis in SAN pacemaking and test whether [Na+]i dysregulation may contribute to SAN dysfunction. Methods: We developed a dataset-specific computational model of the murine SAN myocyte and simulated alterations in the major processes of Na+ entry (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX) and removal (Na+/K+ ATPase, NKA). Results: We found that changes in intracellular Na+ homeostatic processes dynamically regulate SAN electrophysiology. Mild reductions in NKA and NCX function increase myocyte firing rate, whereas a stronger reduction causes bursting activity and loss of automaticity. These pathologic phenotypes mimic those observed experimentally in NCX- and ankyrin-B-deficient mice due to altered feedback between the Ca2+ and membrane potential clocks underlying SAN firing. Conclusions: Our study generates new testable predictions and insight linking Na+ homeostasis to Ca2+ handling and membrane potential dynamics in SAN myocytes that may advance our understanding of SAN (dys)function."

        "abstract": "In arterial myocytes, the canonical function of voltage-gated CaV1.2 and KV2.1 channels is to induce myocyte contraction and relaxation through their responses to membrane depolarization, respectively. Paradoxically, KV2.1 also plays a sex-specific role by promoting the clustering and activity of CaV1.2 channels. However, the impact of KV2.1 protein organization on CaV1.2 function remains poorly understood. We discovered that KV2.1 forms micro-clusters, which can transform into large macro-clusters when a critical clustering site (S590) in the channel is phosphorylated in arterial myocytes. Notably, female myocytes exhibit greater phosphorylation of S590, and macro-cluster formation compared to males. Contrary to current models, the activity of KV2.1 channels seems unrelated to density or macro-clustering in arterial myocytes. Disrupting the KV2.1 clustering site (KV2.1S590A) eliminated KV2.1 macro-clustering and sex-specific differences in CaV1.2 cluster size and activity. We propose that the degree of KV2.1 clustering tunes CaV1.2 channel function in a sex-specific manner in arterial myocytes."

However, the contributions of eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, and the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex (TC) in stabilizing the 43 S PIC are poorly defined. We have reconstituted the human 43 S PIC and used fluorescence anisotropy to systematically measure the affinity of eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3j in the presence of different combinations of 43 S PIC components. Our data reveal a complicated network of interactions that result in high affinity binding of all 43 S PIC components with the 40 S subunit. Human eIF1 and eIF1A bind cooperatively to the 40 S subunit, revealing an evolutionarily conserved interaction. Negative cooperativity is observed between the binding of eIF3j and the binding of eIF1, eIF1A, and TC with the 40 S subunit. To overcome this, eIF3 dramatically increases the affinity of eIF1 and eIF3j for the 40 S subunit. Recruitment of TC also increases the affinity of eIF1 for the 40 S subunit, but this interaction has an important indirect role in increasing the affinity of eIF1A for the 40 S subunit. Together, our data provide a more complete thermodynamic framework of the human 43 S PIC and reveal important interactions between its components to maintain its stability."

Commonly referred to as eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors), this suite of proteins is comprised of at least 25 individual subunits that function in a coordinated, regulated, manner during mRNA translation. Multiple facets of eIF regulation have yet to be elucidated; however, many of the necessary protein factors are phosphorylated. Herein, we have isolated, identified and quantified phosphosites from eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4G generated from log phase grown HeLa cell lysates. Our investigation is the first study to globally quantify eIF phosphosites and illustrates differences in abundance of phosphorylation between the residues of each factor. Thus, identification of those phosphosites that exhibit either high or low levels of phosphorylation under log phase growing conditions may aid researchers to concentrate their investigative efforts to specific phosphosites that potentially harbor important regulatory mechanisms germane to mRNA translation."

These steroids may cross the blood-brain barrier and have dampening effects in the central nervous system.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate if the infusion of a progesterone derivative (allopregnanolone) in a healthy neonatal foal would induce clinical signs compatible with NMS.<h4>Methods</h4>A healthy neonatal foal from a healthy mare with a normal gestation (length, no complications), birth and placenta was infused with allopregnanolone to observe its neurobehavioural effects. Heparinised blood samples were collected pre- and post infusion to determine various progestagen concentrations using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. A second healthy neonatal foal was infused with ethanol and saline for comparison of clinical observations.<h4>Results</h4>Infusion of allopregnanolone resulted in obtundation, lack of affinity for the mare and decreased response to external stimuli. These effects were short-lasting and associated with measurable concentrations of progestagens.<h4>Conclusions and potential relevance</h4>Infusion of a steroid metabolite to a healthy neonatal foal resulted in neurobehavioural alterations compatible with those observed in foals with NMS. These findings suggest that increased progestagen concentrations may be responsible for some of the behavioural changes observed in foals with NMS."

        "abstract": "A revised approach to cloud microphysical processes in a commonly used bulk microphysics parameterization and the importance of correctly representing properties of cloud ice are discussed. Several modifications are introduced to more realistically simulate some of the ice microphysical processes. In addition to the assumption that ice nuclei number concentration is a function of temperature, a new and separate assumption is developed in which ice crystal number concentration is a function of ice amount. Related changes in ice microphysics are introduced, and the impact of sedimentation of ice crystals is also investigated. In an idealized thunderstorm simulation, the distribution of simulated clouds and precipitation is sensitive to the assumptions in microphysical processes, whereas the impact of the sedimentation of cloud ice is small. Overall, the modifications introduced to microphysical processes play a role in significantly reducing cloud ice and increasing snow at colder temperatures and slightly increasing cloud ice and decreasing snow at warmer temperatures. A mesoscale simulation experiment for a heavy rainfall case indicates that impact due to the inclusion of sedimentation of cloud ice is not negligible but is still smaller than that due to the microphysics changes. Together with the sedimentation of ice, the new microphysics reveals a significant improvement in high-cloud amount, surface precipitation, and large-scale mean temperature through a better representation of the ice cloud-radiation feedback. \u00c2\u00a9 2004 American Meteorological Society."

For such prediction problems, it is reasonable to assume that the future observation is independent of the current ones. Our approach is distribution-free, that is, we do not assume that the distributions of the random effects and errors are normal or specified up to a finite number of parameters. We show that for standard mixed linear models, a simple method based on the (regression) residuals works well for constructing prediction intervals. For nonstandard mixed linear models, however, a more complicated method may have to be used, based on estimation of the distribution of the random effects. Simulation studies compare prediction intervals based on the ordinary least squares estimators and those based on the empirical best linear unbiased estimators. We apply the method to a data set regarding lead contamination of soil."

The constrictions imposed by this anatomy on phasmid gut microbiology, its connections to recently released Phasmatodea transcriptomes, and how it differs from the anatomy of related orders in the Polyneoptera are discussed. All Phasmatodea have ridged proventriculi lined or covered with small spines. Anterior projections of the midgut, sometimes described as gastric caeca, are only found in Euphasmatodea and often obscure the proventriculus. We define the cardia as the complex of foregut and midgut tissue where the type II peritrophic matrix is produced. Appendices of the midgut are an autapomorphy for Phasmatodea, but Timema have fewer and larger appendices relative to body size. We suggest caeca-like projections and the loss of large, proventricular teeth are apomorphies of Euphasmatodea.

S.

        "abstract": "An imbalance in the colonic microbiota might underlie many human diseases, but the mechanisms that maintain homeostasis remain elusive. Recent insights suggest that colonocyte metabolism functions as a control switch, mediating a shift between homeostatic and dysbiotic communities. During homeostasis, colonocyte metabolism is directed toward oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in high epithelial oxygen consumption. The consequent epithelial hypoxia helps to maintain a microbial community dominated by obligate anaerobic bacteria, which provide benefit by converting fiber into fermentation products absorbed by the host. Conditions that alter the metabolism of the colonic epithelium increase epithelial oxygenation, thereby driving an expansion of facultative anaerobic bacteria, a hallmark of dysbiosis in the colon. Enteric pathogens subvert colonocyte metabolism to escape niche protection conferred by the gut microbiota. The reverse strategy, a metabolic reprogramming to restore colonocyte hypoxia, represents a promising new therapeutic approach for rebalancing the colonic microbiota in a broad spectrum of human diseases."

Two experiments on face categorization, using both naturally occurring and manipulated minority groups, support this view, suggesting that hypodescent need not be the product of racist or political motivations, but can be sufficiently explained by an individual's learning history."

        "title": "Automatic Antecedents of Discrimination",
        "abstract": "In increasingly diverse societies, discrimination against social groups and their members continues to be a public and political concern. Research has addressed three basic cognitive processes that precede discrimination: categorization, stereotype/prejudice activation, and stereotype/prejudice application, suggesting that these processes occur in an automatic fashion. However, there are multiple components of automaticity, including unawareness, efficiency, unintentionality, and uncontrollability. Most of the previous research implies that these components of automaticity converge with respect to cognitive antecedents of discrimination. Here, we review evidence on the distinct components of automaticity in order to assess whether (a) categorization, (b) stereotype/prejudice activation, and (c) stereotype/prejudice application occur (1) without awareness, (2) efficiently, and (3) goal-independently. We highlight evidence indicating convergence or divergence of the automaticity components during each of the processing stages. This analysis provides readers with an up-to-date review that helps to evaluate whether a multi-component approach to automaticity is of additional benefit in aggregating knowledge about the cognitive antecedents of discrimination. We discuss open issues and avenues for future research."

In the retina, transplantation of stem cells has been limited by inefficient survival and integration into existing circuits. In November 2016, as part of the National Eye Institute's Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI), a diverse collection of investigators gathered for a workshop devoted to articulating the gaps in knowledge, barriers to progress, and ideas for new approaches to understanding cellular environments within the retina and how these environments may be manipulated. In doing so, the group identified the areas of (1) retinal and optic nerve glia, (2) microglia and inflammation, and the (3) extracellular matrix (ECM) and retinal vasculature as key to advancing our understanding and manipulation of the retinal microenvironments. We summarize here the findings of the workshop for the broader scientific community."

To address this need, we developed a novel mouse ocular xenograft model. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing human glioblastoma cells (between 500 and 10,000) were implanted into the subretinal space of immunodeficient mice (56 eyes). The resultant xenografts were imaged in vivo non-invasively with combined fluorescence scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and volumetric optical coherence tomography (OCT) for a period up to several months. Most xenografts exhibited a latent phase followed by a stable or rapidly increasing volume, but about 1/3 underwent spontaneous remission. After prescribed growth, a population of tumors was treated with intravenously delivered doxorubicin-containing porphyrin and cholic acid-based nanoparticles (\"nanodox\"). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) emission (doxorubicin \u00e2\u2020\u2019 porphyrin) was used to localize nanodox in the xenografts, and 690 nm light exposure to activate it. Such photo-nanotherapy was highly effective in reducing tumor volume. Histopathology and flow cytometry revealed CD4 + and CD8 + immune cell infiltration of xenografts. Overall, the ocular model shows potential for examining the relationships between neoplastic growth, neovascularization and other features of the immune microenvironment, and for evaluating treatment response longitudinally in vivo."

Mesenchymal stem cells have been of particular clinical interest due to their ability to release beneficial neurotrophic factors and their ability to foster a neuroprotective microenviroment. While early stem cell transplantation therapies have been fraught with technical and political concerns as well as limited clinical benefits, mesenchymal stem cell therapies have been shown to be clinically beneficial and derivable from nonembryonic, adult sources.

Spatial memory measures are promising candidates because they are based on 'visual' or 'non-verbal' cognition, and are commonly tested in both animals and humans. Here, we consider the suitability of spatial memory for strengthening translational links between animals and humans in HD research and clinical trials. We describe findings of spatial memory impairments in human HD and mouse models, including which aspects of spatial memory are most affected and at which time points in disease progression. We also describe the neural systems that underlie spatial memory and link spatial memory impairments to HD neuropathology, focussing on striatal and hippocampal systems. We provide a critical analysis of the literature in terms of the suitability of spatial memory for bridging the translational gap between species. Finally, we discuss possible neural mechanisms that might explain the spatial memory impairments seen in HD, and their relevance to potential treatments."

Effective delivery methodologies remain a major barrier in targeting the central nervous system. Currently, adeno-associated virus is the most wellvalidated delivery system for the delivery of DBDs towards the central nervous with multiple, ongoing clinical trials. While effective in transducing neuronal cells, viral delivery systems for DBDs remain problematic due to inherent viral packaging limits or immune responses that hinder translational potential. Direct administration of DBDs or encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles may provide alternative means towards delivering gene therapies into the central nervous system. This review will evaluate the strengths and limitations of current DBD delivery strategies in vivo. Furthermore, this review will discuss the use of adult stem cells as a putative delivery vehicle for DBDs and the potential advantages that these systems have over previous methodologies."

        "abstract": "Individuals within any species exhibit differences in size, developmental state, or spatial location. These differences coupled with environmental fluctuations in demographic rates can have subtle effects on population persistence and species coexistence. To understand these effects, we provide a general theory for coexistence of structured, interacting species living in a stochastic environment. The theory is applicable to nonlinear, multi species matrix models with stochastically varying parameters. The theory relies on long-term growth rates of species corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov exponents of random matrix products. Our coexistence criterion requires that a convex combination of these long-term growth rates is positive with probability one whenever one or more species are at low density. When this condition holds, the community is stochastically persistent: the fraction of time that a species density goes below (formula presented) approaches zero as (formula presented) approaches zero. Applications to predator-prey interactions in an autocorrelated environment, a stochastic LPA model, and spatial lottery models are provided. These applications demonstrate that positive autocorrelations in temporal fluctuations can disrupt predator-prey coexistence, fluctuations in log-fecundity can facilitate persistence in structured populations, and long-lived, relatively sedentary competing populations are likely to coexist in spatially and temporally heterogenous environments."

It is a bicyclic octapeptide and represents up to 40% of the amatoxins in mushrooms, damaging the liver and kidneys. Current methods of detecting amatoxins are time-consuming and require the use of expensive equipment. A novel label-free electrochemical immunosensor was successfully developed for rapid detection of \u00ce\u00b1-amanitin, which was fabricated by immobilization of anti-\u00ce\u00b1-amanitin antibodies onto a functionalized cellulose nanofibrous membrane-modified carbon screen-printed electrode. An oxidation peak of the captured amanitin on the tethered antibodies was observed at 0.45 V. The performance of the nanofibrous membrane on the electrode and necessary fabrication steps were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Due to its unique structural features and properties such as high specific surface area and microporous structure, the nanofibrous membrane as an immunosensor matrix for antibody tethering improved the electrochemical performance of the immunosensor by more than 3 times compared with cast membranes. Under the optimal conditions, the assembled immunosensor exhibited high sensitivity toward \u00ce\u00b1-amanitin detection in the range of 0.009-2 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection of 8.3 pg mL-1. The results clearly indicate that the fabricated nanofiber-based-immunosensor is suitable for point-of-care detection of lethal \u00ce\u00b1-amanitin in human urine without any pretreatment within 30 min."

This paper is an introduction and call to action for researchers interested in understanding how to study caregiver-infant interactions in the home and diverse cultural contexts, including marginalized communities. We argue that research will be more valid, culturally relevant, and tapped-in to the daily lives of caregivers and infants if there is partnership and collaboration with the caregivers in the design of the questions, data collection and analysis, and distribution of the findings. We recommend dynamically assessing emotions, behaviors, and physiology using repeated sampling methods including ecological momentary assessments (EMA), salivary bioscience, and actigraphy. We aim to extend current practices of studying caregiver-infant co-regulation by measuring fluctuations of daily life and considering sociocultural factors that shape naturalistic caregiver-infant interactions. Using methodological advancements and community-based participatory research approaches can enable developmental scientists to measure life as it is actually lived."

        "abstract": "The transparent cornea is the major refractive element of the eye. A finely controlled assembly of the stromal extracellular matrix is critical to corneal function, as well as in establishing the appropriate mechanical stability required to maintain corneal shape and curvature. In the stroma, homogeneous, small diameter collagen fibrils, regularly packed with a highly ordered hierarchical organization, are essential for function. This review focuses on corneal stroma assembly and the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis. Corneal collagen fibrillogenesis involves multiple molecules interacting in sequential steps, as well as interactions between keratocytes and stroma matrix components. The stroma has the highest collagen V:I ratio in the body. Collagen V regulates the nucleation of protofibril assembly, thus controlling the number of fibrils and assembly of smaller diameter fibrils in the stroma. The corneal stroma is also enriched in small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) that cooperate in a temporal and spatial manner to regulate linear and lateral collagen fibril growth. In addition, the fibril-associated collagens (FACITs) such as collagen XII and collagen XIV have roles in the regulation of fibril packing and inter-lamellar interactions. A communicating keratocyte network contributes to the overall and long-range regulation of stromal extracellular matrix assembly, by creating micro-domains where the sequential steps in stromal matrix assembly are controlled. Keratocytes control the synthesis of extracellular matrix components, which interact with the keratocytes dynamically to coordinate the regulatory steps into a cohesive process. Mutations or deficiencies in stromal regulatory molecules result in altered interactions and deficiencies in both transparency and refraction, leading to corneal stroma pathobiology such as stromal dystrophies, cornea plana and keratoconus."

        "abstract": "IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 is a major cytokine that mediates resistance against the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The p65 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are strongly induced by IFN-\u00ce\u00b3. We studied the behavior of murine GBP1 (mGBP1) upon infection with T. gondii in vitro and confirmed that IFN-\u00ce\u00b3-dependent re-localization of mGBP1 to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) correlates with the virulence type of the parasite. We identified three parasitic factors, ROP16, ROP18, and GRA15 that determine strain-specific accumulation of mGBP1 on the PV. These highly polymorphic proteins are held responsible for a large part of the strain-specific differences in virulence. Therefore, our data suggest that virulence of T. gondii in animals may rely in part on recognition by GBPs. However, phagosomes or vacuoles containing Trypanosoma cruzi did not recruit mGBP1. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed mGBP2, mGBP4, and mGBP5 as binding partners of mGBP1. Indeed, mGBP2 and mGBP5 co-localize with mGBP1 in T. gondii-infected cells. T. gondii thus elicits a cell-autonomous immune response in mice with GBPs involved. Three parasitic virulence factors and unknown IFN-\u00ce\u00b3-dependent host factors regulate this complex process. Depending on the virulence of the strains involved, numerous GBPs are brought to the PV as part of a large, multimeric structure to combat T. gondii."

        "title": "Clonal and atypical Toxoplasma strain differences in virulence vary with mouse sub-species",
        "abstract": "The severe virulence of Toxoplasma gondii in classical laboratory inbred mouse strains contradicts the hypothesis that house mice (Mus musculus) are the most important intermediate hosts for its transmission and evolution because death of the mouse before parasite transmission equals death of the parasite. However, the classical laboratory inbred mouse strains (Mus musculus domesticus), commonly used to test Toxoplasma strain differences in virulence, do not capture the genetic diversity within Mus musculus. Thus, it is possible that Toxoplasma strains that are severely virulent in laboratory inbred mice are avirulent in some other mouse sub-species. Here, we present insight into the responses of individual mouse strains, representing strains of the genetically divergent Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus castaneus and Mus musculus domesticus, to infection with individual clonal and atypical Toxoplasma strains. We observed that, unlike M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus are resistant to the clonal Toxoplasma strains. For M. m. musculus, we show that this is due to a locus on chromosome 11 that includes the genes that encode the interferon gamma (IFNG)-inducible immunity-related GTPases (Irgs) that can kill the parasite by localising and subsequently vesiculating the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. However, despite the localization of known effector Irgs to the Toxoplasma parasitophorous vacuole membrane, we observed that some atypical Toxoplasma strains are virulent in all the mouse strains tested. The virulence of these atypical strains in M. m. musculus could not be attributed to individual rhoptry protein 5 (ROP5) alleles, a secreted parasite pseudokinase that antagonises the canonical effector Irgs and is indispensable for parasite virulence in laboratory inbred mice (M. m. domesticus). We conclude that murine resistance to Toxoplasma is modulated by complex interactions between host and parasite genotypes and may be independent of known effector Irgs on murine chromosome 11."

Although both molecular and antigen testing have clearly defined uses, the utility of serology remains uncertain and is presently not recommended for assessing immunity.MethodsWe conducted a pragmatic, observational study evaluating four commercially available emergency use authorized laboratory-based COVID-19 serology assays (Assays A-D). Remnant samples from hospitalized, and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients, as well as vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were collected and tested. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated. Antibody concentrations were compared across the platforms and populations.ResultsA total of 588 remnant samples derived from 500 patients were tested. PPA at 5-12 weeks post-PCR positive results for Assays A-D was 98.3, 97.4, 99.2, and 95.8% respectively. NPA was 100% across all platforms. Mean antibody concentrations at 2-4 weeks post-PCR positive result were significantly higher in hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients, respectively, for Assay A (131.8 [101.7] vs. 95.6 [100.3] AU/mL, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001), B (61.7 [62.4] vs. 38.1 [40.5] AU/mL, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001), and C (157.6 [105.3] vs. 133.3 [100.7] AU/mL, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001). For individuals receiving two vaccine doses mean antibody concentrations were respectively 169.6 (104.4), 27.3 (50.8), 189.6 (120.9), 21.19 (13.1) AU/mL for Assays A-D.ConclusionsOverall, PPA and NPA differed across the four assays. Assays A and C produced higher PPA and NPA and detected larger concentrations of antibodies following vaccination."

        "abstract": "Background and purposeTumor location has been shown to be a significant prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma. The purpose of this study was to characterize glioblastoma lesions by identifying MR imaging voxel-based tumor location features that are associated with tumor molecular profiles, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes.Materials and methodsPreoperative T1 anatomic MR images of 384 patients with glioblastomas were obtained from 2 independent cohorts (n = 253 from the Stanford University Medical Center for training and n = 131 from The Cancer Genome Atlas for validation). An automated computational image-analysis pipeline was developed to determine the anatomic locations of tumor in each patient. Voxel-based differences in tumor location between good (overall survival of >17 months) and poor (overall survival of <11 months) survival groups identified in the training cohort were used to classify patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort into 2 brain-location groups, for which clinical features, messenger RNA expression, and copy number changes were compared to elucidate the biologic basis of tumors located in different brain regions.ResultsTumors in the right occipitotemporal periventricular white matter were significantly associated with poor survival in both training and test cohorts (both, log-rank P < .05) and had larger tumor volume compared with tumors in other locations. Tumors in the right periatrial location were associated with hypoxia pathway enrichment and PDGFRA amplification, making them potential targets for subgroup-specific therapies.ConclusionsVoxel-based location in glioblastoma is associated with patient outcome and may have a potential role for guiding personalized treatment."

        "abstract": "The Ca(2+)-responsive phosphatase calcineurin/protein phosphatase 2B dephosphorylates the transcription factor NFATc3. In the myocardium activation of NFATc3 down-regulates the expression of voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels after myocardial infarction (MI). This prolongs action potential duration and increases the probability of arrhythmias. Although recent studies infer that calcineurin is activated by local and transient Ca(2+) signals the molecular mechanism that underlies the process is unclear in ventricular myocytes. Here we test the hypothesis that sequestering of calcineurin to the sarcolemma of ventricular myocytes by the anchoring protein AKAP150 is required for acute activation of NFATc3 and the concomitant down-regulation of Kv channels following MI. Biochemical and cell based measurements resolve that approximately 0.2% of the total calcineurin activity in cardiomyocytes is associated with AKAP150. Electrophysiological analyses establish that formation of this AKAP150-calcineurin signaling dyad is essential for the activation of the phosphatase and the subsequent down-regulation of Kv channel currents following MI. Thus AKAP150-mediated targeting of calcineurin to sarcolemmal micro-domains in ventricular myocytes contributes to the local and acute gene remodeling events that lead to the down-regulation of Kv currents."

Oral malignant melanoma and multilobular osteochondrosarcoma were most at risk. Abdominal metastasis was diagnosed in 2% of oral tumors (0% odontogenic, 3.1% nonodontogenic) and cytologically confirmed in 2 cases (0.6% [2/295)] of all abdominal ultrasounds (AUS) 5.5% [2/36] of all AUS that had cytology). Both cases had oral malignant melanoma. Incidental disease was diagnosed in 53.1% and 81.3% of thoracic and abdominal screenings, respectively. Major findings were more common in AUS (7.8%) compared to thoracic screening (1.9%). The prevalence of incidental findings was similar for odontogenic and nonodontogenic tumors. Both metastasis and major findings were diagnosed more commonly with thoracic CT compared to radiographs. Metastasis or a major finding of prognostic significance was diagnosed in at least 1 test in 27.8% of patients that had head CT, lymph node cytology, thoracic screening, and AUS (n = 115).Clinical relevanceMajor incidental findings were more commonly detected with AUS and were diagnosed in 1 in every 12 patients. However, metastatic disease was most commonly detected with thoracic screening. When all 4 screening tests are performed, there is an approximately 1 in 4 chance of diagnosing metastasis or major significant disease regardless of tumor type."

To demonstrate this, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline, FASER (Food Authentication from SEquencing Reads), designed to resolve the relative composition of mixtures of eukaryotic species using RNA or DNA sequencing. Our comprehensive database includes >6000 plants and animals that may be present in food. FASER accurately identified eukaryotic species with 0.4% median absolute difference between observed and expected proportions on sequence data from various sources including sausage meat, plants, and fish. FASER was applied to 31 high protein powder raw factory ingredient total RNA samples. The samples mostly contained the expected source ingredient, chicken, while three samples unexpectedly contained pork and beef. Our results demonstrate that DNA/RNA sequencing of food ingredients, combined with a robust analysis, can be used to find contaminants and authenticate food ingredients in a single assay."

Beyond critical extracellular mediators of leukocyte trafficking, chemokines and their cognate receptors are expressed by a variety of resident and infiltrating cells (monocytes, lymphocytes, NK cells, mast cells, and NKT cells). Chemokines represent ideal candidates for mechanistic studies (particularly in murine models) to better understand the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and possibly become biomarkers of disease. Nonetheless, therapeutic approaches targeting chemokines have led to unsatisfactory results in rheumatoid arthritis, while biologics against pro-inflammatory cytokines are being used worldwide with success.

We aimed to determine whether specific types of mental disorders and increasing numbers of mental disorders were associated with the onset of arthritis later in life.MethodData were collected using face-to-face household surveys, conducted in 19 countries from different regions of the world (n=52,095). Lifetime prevalence and age at onset of 16 DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed retrospectively with the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI). Arthritis was assessed by self-report of lifetime history of arthritis and age at onset. Survival analyses estimated the association of initial onset of mental disorders with subsequent onset of arthritis.ResultsAfter adjusting for comorbidity, the number of mood, anxiety, impulse-control, and substance disorders remained significantly associated with arthritis onset showing odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.2 to 1.4. Additionally, the risk of developing arthritis increased as the number of mental disorders increased from one to five or more disorders.ConclusionThis study suggests links between mental disorders and subsequent arthritis onset using a large, multi-country dataset. These associations lend support to the idea that it may be possible to reduce the severity of mental disorder-arthritis comorbidity through early identification and effective treatment of mental disorders."

        "abstract": "A sensitive, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS; 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether) was developed. Novel immunizing haptens were synthesized by derivatizing at the 4-Cl position of the TCS molecule. Compounds derived from substitutions at 4'-Cl and that replaced the 2'-OH with a Cl atom were designed as unique coating antigen haptens. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were screened against the coating antigen library to identify combinations of immunoreagents resulting in the most sensitive assays. The most sensitive assay identified was one utilizing antiserum no. 1155 and a heterologous competitive hapten, where the 2'-OH group was substituted with a Cl atom. An IC50 value and the detection range for TCS in assay buffer were 1.19 and 0.21-6.71 \u00ce\u00bcg/L, respectively. The assay was selective for TCS, providing low cross-reactivity (<5%) to the major metabolites of TCS and to brominated diphenyl ether-47. A second assay utilizing a competitive hapten containing Br instead of Cl substitutions was broadly selective for both brominated and chlorinated diphenylethers. Using the most sensitive assay combination, we measured TCS concentrations in water samples following dilution. Biosolid samples were analyzed following the dilution of a simple solvent extract. The immunoassay results were similar to those determined by LC-MS/MS. This immunoassay can be used as a rapid and convenient tool to screen for human and environmental exposure."

        "abstract": "Cancer therapy reduces tumor burden via tumor cell death (\"debris\"), which can accelerate tumor progression via the failure of inflammation resolution. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop treatment modalities that stimulate the clearance or resolution of inflammation-associated debris. Here, we demonstrate that chemotherapy-generated debris stimulates metastasis by up-regulating soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and the prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP4). Therapy-induced tumor cell debris triggers a storm of proinflammatory and proangiogenic eicosanoid-driven cytokines. Thus, targeting a single eicosanoid or cytokine is unlikely to prevent chemotherapy-induced metastasis. Pharmacological abrogation of both sEH and EP4 eicosanoid pathways prevents hepato-pancreatic tumor growth and liver metastasis by promoting macrophage phagocytosis of debris and counterregulating a protumorigenic eicosanoid and cytokine storm. Therefore, stimulating the clearance of tumor cell debris via combined sEH and EP4 inhibition is an approach to prevent debris-stimulated metastasis and tumor growth."

        "abstract": "Agonist-triggered downregulation of \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) constitutes vital negative feedback to prevent cellular overexcitation. Here, we report a novel downregulation of \u00ce\u00b22AR signaling highly specific for Cav1.2. We find that \u00ce\u00b22-AR binding to Cav1.2 residues 1923-1942 is required for \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic regulation of Cav1.2. Despite the prominence of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Cav1.2 S1928 within the newly identified \u00ce\u00b22AR binding site, its physiological function has so far escaped identification. We show that phosphorylation of S1928 displaces the \u00ce\u00b22AR from Cav1.2 upon \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic stimulation rendering Cav1.2 refractory for several minutes from further \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic stimulation. This effect is lost in S1928A knock-in mice. Although AMPARs are clustered at postsynaptic sites like Cav1.2, \u00ce\u00b22AR association with and regulation of AMPARs do not show such dissociation. Accordingly, displacement of the \u00ce\u00b22AR from Cav1.2 is a uniquely specific desensitization mechanism of Cav1.2 regulation by highly localized \u00ce\u00b22AR/cAMP/PKA/S1928 signaling. The physiological implications of this mechanism are underscored by our finding that LTP induced by prolonged theta tetanus (PTT-LTP) depends on Cav1.2 and its regulation by channel-associated \u00ce\u00b22AR."

        "abstract": "\u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic receptor (\u00ce\u00b2-AR) signaling in cardiac myocytes is central to cardiac function, but spatiotemporal activation within myocytes is unresolved. In rabbit ventricular myocytes, \u00ce\u00b2-AR agonists or high extracellular [Ca] were applied locally at one end, to measure \u00ce\u00b2-AR signal propagation as Ca-transient (CaT) amplitude and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca uptake. High local [Ca]o, increased CaT amplitude under the pipette faster than did ISO, but was also more spatially restricted. Local isoproterenol (ISO) or norepinephrine (NE) increased CaT amplitude and SR Ca uptake, that spread along the myocyte to the unexposed end. Thus, local [Ca]i decline kinetics reflect spatio-temporal progression of \u00ce\u00b2-AR end-effects in myocytes. To test whether intracellular \u00ce\u00b2-ARs contribute to this response, we used \u00ce\u00b2-AR-blockers that are membrane permeant (propranolol) or not (sotalol). Propranolol completely blocked NE-dependent CaT effects. However, blocking surface \u00ce\u00b2-ARs only (sotalol) suppressed only \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc50% of the NE-induced increase in CaT peak and rate of [Ca]i decline, but these changes spread more gradually than NE alone. We also tested whether A-kinase anchoring protein 7\u00ce\u00b3 (AKAP7\u00ce\u00b3; that interacts with phospholamban) is mobile, such that it might contribute to intracellular spatial propagation of \u00ce\u00b2-AR signaling. We found AKAP7\u00ce\u00b3 to be highly mobile using fluorescence recovery after photobleach of GFP tagged AKAP7\u00ce\u00b3, and that PKA activation accelerated AKAP7\u00ce\u00b3-GFP wash-out upon myocyte saponin-permeabilization, suggesting increased AKAP7\u00ce\u00b3 mobility. We conclude that local \u00ce\u00b2-AR activation can activate SR Ca uptake at remote myocyte sites, and that intracellular \u00ce\u00b2-AR and AKAP7\u00ce\u00b3 mobility may play a role in this spread of activation."

In addition, a comparative study was made to evaluate the suitability of a high-throughput automated electrophoresis platform for quantifying the DNA degradation under microwave radiation. Overall, this study investigated the genomic DNA degradation of E. coli under microwave radiation using automated gel electrophoresis. To examine the viable organisms and degradation of genomic DNA under microwave exposure, we used three methods: (1) post-microwave exposure, where E. coli was enumerated using modified mTEC agar method using membrane filtration technique; (2) extracted genomic DNA of microwaved sample was quantified using the Qubit method; and (3) automated gel electrophoresis, the TapeStation 4200, was used to examine the bands of extracted DNA of microwaved samples. In addition, to examine the impacts of microwaves, E. coli colonies were isolated from a fecal sample (dairy cow manure), these colonies were grown overnight to prepare fresh E. coli culture, and this culture was exposed to microwave radiation for three durations: (1) 2 min; (2) 5 min; and (3) 8 min. In general, Qubit values (ng/\u00c2\u00b5L) were proportional to the results of automated gel electrophoresis, TapeStation 4200, DNA integrity numbers (DINs). Samples from exposure studies (2 min, 5 min, and 8 min) showed no viable E. coli. Initial E. coli levels (at 0 min microwave exposure) were 5 \u00c3\u2014 108 CFU/mL, and the E. coli level was reduced to a non-detectable level within 2 min of microwave exposure. The relationships between Qubit and TapeStation measurements was linear, except for when the DNA level was lower than 2 ng/\u00c2\u00b5L. In 8 min of microwave exposure, E. coli DNA integrity was reduced by 61.7%, and DNA concentration was reduced by 81.6%. The overall conclusion of this study is that microwave radiation had a significant impact on the genomic DNA of E. coli, and prolonged exposure of E. coli to microwaves can thus lead to a loss of genomic DNA integrity and DNA concentrations."

With highly varied phenotypes and a lack of biomarkers for the different clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment can be difficult.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to analyze serum metabolomics profiles of patients with Wilson disease compared to healthy subjects, with the goal of identifying differentially abundant metabolites as potential biomarkers for this condition.MethodsHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry was used to evaluate the untargeted serum metabolome of 61 patients with WD (26 hepatic and 25 neurologic subtypes, 10 preclinical) compared to 15 healthy subjects. We conducted analysis of covariance with potential confounders (body mass index, age, sex) as covariates and partial least-squares analysis.ResultsAfter adjusting for clinical covariates and multiple testing, we identified 99 significantly different metabolites (FDR\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.05) between WD and healthy subjects. Subtype comparisons also revealed significantly different metabolites compared to healthy subjects: WD hepatic subtype (67), WD neurologic subtype (57), WD hepatic-neurologic combined (77), and preclinical (36). Pathway analysis revealed these metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, choline metabolism, and oxidative stress.ConclusionsPatients with WD are characterized by a distinct metabolomics profile providing new insights into WD pathogenesis and identifying new potential diagnostic biomarkers."

Here we provide a protocol for generating cell sheets, isolated cells, and cell fragments of keratocytes from zebrafish scales. The protocol starts with a comprehensive fish preparation, followed by critical steps for scale processing and subsequent cell sheet generation, single cell isolation, and cell fragment induction, which can be accomplished in just 3 days including a 36-48 h incubation time. Compared to other approaches that usually produce single cells only or together with either fragments or cell groups, this facile and reliable methodology allows generation of all three motile forms simultaneously. With the powerful genetics in zebrafish our model system offers a useful tool for comparison of the mechanisms by which cell sheets, single cells, and cell fragments respond to extracellular stimuli."

        "abstract": "Cell motility in response to environmental cues forms the basis of many developmental processes in multicellular organisms. One such environmental cue is an electric field (EF), which induces a form of motility known as electrotaxis. Electrotaxis has evolved in a number of cell types to guide wound healing and has been associated with different cellular processes, suggesting that observed electrotactic behavior is likely a combination of multiple distinct effects arising from the presence of an EF. To determine the different mechanisms by which observed electrotactic behavior emerges, and thus to design EFs that can be applied to direct and control electrotaxis, researchers require accurate quantitative predictions of cellular responses to externally applied fields. Here, we use mathematical modeling to formulate and parameterize a variety of hypothetical descriptions of how cell motility may change in response to an EF. We calibrate our model to observed data using synthetic likelihoods and Bayesian sequential learning techniques and demonstrate that EFs bias cellular motility through only one of a selection of hypothetical mechanisms. We also demonstrate how the model allows us to make predictions about cellular motility under different EFs. The resulting model and calibration methodology will thus form the basis for future data-driven and model-based feedback control strategies based on electric actuation."

Here we track individual personality and performance and collective performance among groups of social spiders where we manipulated the familiarity of the group members. We show that individual personalities, as measured by consistent individual differences in boldness behavior, strengthen with increasing familiarity and that these personalities can be disrupted by a change in group membership. Changing group membership negatively impacted both individual and group performance. Individuals in less familiar groups lost weight, and these groups were less successful at performing vital collective tasks. These results provide a mechanism for the evolution of stable social groups by demonstrating that social niche reestablishment carries a steep cost for both individuals and groups. Social niche specialization may therefore provide a potential first step on the path toward more organized social systems."

However, little is known about the extent to which neural specificity in these brain regions, or the distinctiveness with which sensory information is represented, continues to develop during middle childhood and how it contributes to memory performance. The present study used multivariate pattern analysis to examine the distinctiveness of different scene representations in 169 children and 31 adults, and its relation to memory performance. Most children provided data over up to three measurement occasions between 8 and 15 years (267 total scans), allowing us to examine changes in memory and neural specificity over time. Memory performance was lower in children than in adults, and increased in children over time. Different scenes presented during memory encoding could be reliably decoded from parahippocampal, lateral occipital, and retrosplenial regions in children and adults. Neural specificity in children was similar to adults, and did not change reliably over time. Among children, higher neural specificity in scene-processing regions was associated with better memory concurrently. These results suggest that the distinctiveness with which incoming information is represented is important for memory performance in childhood, but other processes operating on these representations support developmental improvements in memory performance over time."

We perform temperature and spatial dependent angle--resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements through the Curie temperature (Tc), which show large band shifts and renormalization concomitant with the onset of magnetism. We argue that Co3Sn2S2 evolves from a Mott ferromagnet below Tc to a correlated metallic state above Tc. To understand the magnetism, we derive a tight-binding model of Co-3dx2\u00e2\u02c6\u2019y2 orbitals on the kagome lattice. At the filling obtained by first-principles calculations, this model reproduces the ferromagnetic ground state, and results in the reduction of Coulomb interactions due to cluster effects. Using a disordered local moment simulation, we show how this reduced Hubbard-U leads to a collapse of the bands across the magnetic transition, resulting in a correlated state which carries associated characteristic photoemission signatures that are distinct from those of a simple lifting of exchange splitting. The behavior of topology across Tc is discussed in the context of this description of the magnetism."

Therefore, enriching \u00ce\u00b2-carotene accumulation in wheat grain endosperm will enable a sustainable dietary supplementation of provitamin A. Several metabolic genes affecting \u00ce\u00b2-carotene accumulation have already been isolated from wheat, including phytoene synthase 1 (PSY1), lycopene \u00ce\u00b5-cyclase (LCYe) and carotenoid \u00ce\u00b2-ring hydroxylase1/2 (HYD1/2).ResultsIn this work, we cloned and biochemically characterized two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), CCD1 and CCD4, from wheat. While CCD1 homoeologs cleaved \u00ce\u00b2-apo-8'-carotenal, \u00ce\u00b2-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin into apocarotenoid products, CCD4 homoeologs were inactive towards these substrates in in vitro assays. When analyzed by real-time qPCR, PSY1, LCYe, HYD1/2 and CCD1/4 homoeologs showed distinct expression patterns in vegetative tissues and sections of developing tetraploid and hexaploid wheat grains, suggesting that carotenoid metabolic genes and homoeologs are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level in wheat.ConclusionsThe CCD1/4 enzyme activity and the spatial-temporal gene expression data provide critical insights into the specific carotenoid metabolic gene homoeologs that control \u00ce\u00b2-carotene accumulation in wheat grain endosperm, thus establishing the knowledge base for generation of wheat varieties with enhanced \u00ce\u00b2-carotene in the endosperm through breeding and genome editing approaches."

Lastly, an initial assessment of the in vivo performance of the mini-EXPLORER was undertaken with a dynamic 18F-FDG nonhuman primate (rhesus monkey) imaging study. Results: The NU-2 total sensitivity was 5.0%, and the peak noise-equivalent count rate measured with the NU-4 monkey scatter phantom was 1,741 kcps, both obtained using the maximum acceptance angle (46\u00c2\u00b0). The NU-4 scatter fraction was 16.5%, less than 1% higher than with a 14\u00c2\u00b0 acceptance angle. The reconstructed spatial resolution was approximately 3.0 mm at the center of the FOV, with a minor loss in axial spatial resolution (0.5 mm) when the acceptance angle increased from 14\u00c2\u00b0 to 46\u00c2\u00b0. The rhesus monkey 18F-FDG study demonstrated the benefit of the high sensitivity of the mini-EXPLORER, including fast imaging (1-s early frames), excellent image quality (30-s and 5-min frames), and late-time-point imaging (18 h after injection), all obtained at a single bed position that captured the major organs of the rhesus monkey. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the physical performance and imaging capabilities of a long axial FOV PET scanner designed for high-sensitivity imaging of nonhuman primates. Further, the results of this study suggest that a wide acceptance angle can be used with a long axial FOV scanner to maximize sensitivity while introducing only minor trade-offs such as a small increase in scatter fraction and slightly degraded axial spatial resolution."

        "abstract": "Ultrasensitive, high-resolution, extended-field-of-view total-body (TB) PET using the first-of-its-kind 194-cm axial-field-of-view uEXPLORER may facilitate the interrogation of biologic hallmarks of hitherto difficult-to-evaluate low-signal vessel wall pathology in cardiovascular disease. Methods: Healthy volunteers were imaged serially for up to 12\u00e2\u20ac\u2030h after a standard dose of 18F-FDG (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203015) or for up to 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2030h after injection of a very low dose (about 5% of a standard dose; n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203015). A cohort undergoing standard 18F-FDG PET (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203015) on a conventional scanner with a 22-cm axial field of view served as a comparison group. Arterial wall signal, crosstalk with hematopoietic and lymphoid organs, and image quality were analyzed using standardized techniques. Results: TB PET depicted the large vessel walls with excellent quality. The arterial wall could be imaged with high contrast up to 12\u00e2\u20ac\u2030h after tracer injection. Ultralow-dose TB 18F-FDG images yielded a vessel wall signal and target-to-background ratio comparable to those of conventional-dose, short-axial-field-of-view PET. Crosstalk between vessel wall and lymphoid organs was identified with better accuracy in both TB PET cohorts than in conventional PET. Conclusion: TB PET enables detailed assessment of in&nbsp;vivo vessel wall biology and its crosstalk with other organs over an extended time window after tracer injection or at an ultralow tracer dose. These initial observations support the feasibility of serial imaging in low-risk populations and will stimulate future mechanistic studies or therapy monitoring in atherosclerosis and other vessel wall pathologies."

The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of drying bed thickness on drying characteristics and quality of rough rice under IR heating. The samples of freshly harvested medium grain rice (M202 variety) with 20.5 % and 23.8% (wb) moisture contents were used for this study. They were dried with two different radiation intensities, 4685 and 5348 W/m 2, for six exposure times, 15, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 s, for each drying bed thickness. The tested three drying bed thicknesses were single layer, 5 mm and 10 mm. After IR drying, the samples were tempered for 4 hours followed by slow cooling. The drying rate, moisture removal and temperature of rice during drying were measured and calculated. The rice temperatures after the IR heating were in the range of 35.9 to 71.4 \u00c2\u00b0C. The heating and drying rates decreased with the increase of bed thickness. A significant amount of moisture was removed during slow cooling after tempering, without additional energy input. The quality of milled rice, including total rice yield, head rice yield, and degree of milling of the dried rice was evaluated. It was concluded that a high heating rate, fast drying and good rice quality could be achieved by heating rough rice to about 60 \u00c2\u00b0C followed by tempering and slow cooling with a bed thickness up to 10 mm."

The discovery of carcinogenic and genotoxic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in processed meat products has had serious negative impacts on the meat industry. In order to clarify the relationship between the use of nitrite or nitrate and the safety of meat or meat products, we reviewed NOCs in meat and meat products, the origin and safety implications of NOCs, effects of nitrite and nitrate on meat quality, national regulations, recent publications concerning the using of nitrite and nitrate in meat or meat products, and reduction methods. By comparing and analyzing references, (1) we found antioxidant, flavor improvement and shelf-life extension effects were recently proposed functions of nitrite and nitrate on meat quality, (2) the multiple functions of nitrite and nitrate in meat and meat products couldn't be fully replaced by other food additives at present, (3) we observed that the residual nitrite in raw meat and fried meat products was not well monitored, (4) alternative additives seem to be the most successful methods of replacing nitrite in meat processing, currently. The health risks of consuming processed meat products should be further evaluated, and more effective methods or additives for replacing nitrite or nitrate are needed."

More extensive molecular analysis of metastatic ovarian cancer is needed to identify post-translational modifications of proteins, especially glycosylation that is particularly associated with metastatic disease to better understand the metastatic process and identify potential therapeutic targets. Glycoproteins in ascites fluid were enriched by affinity binding to lectins (ConA or WGA) and other affinity matrices. Separate glycomic, proteomic, and glycopeptide analyses were performed. Relative abundances of different N-glycan groups and proteins were identified from ascites fluids and a serum control. Levels of biomarkers CA125, MUC1, and fibronectin were also monitored in OC ascites samples by Western blot analysis. N-Glycan analysis of ascites fluids showed the presence of large, highly fucosylated and sialylated complex and hybrid glycans, some of which were not observed in normal serum. OC ascites glycoproteins, haptoglobin, fibronectin, lumican, fibulin, hemopexin, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin were more abundant in OC ascites or not present in serum control samples. Further glycopeptide analysis of OC ascites identified N- and O-glycans in clusterin, hemopexin, and fibulin glycopeptides, some of which are unusual and may be important in OC metastasis."

Here we employ high-resolution mass spectrometric profiling to comprehensively identify and quantitatively measure the exact modifications of native intestinal epithelial cell surface N-glycans induced by S. typhimurium infection. Sixty minutes postinfection, select sialylated structures showed decreases in terms of total number and abundances. To assess the effect of cell surface mannosylation, we selectively rerouted glycan expression on the host using the alpha-mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine, toward overexpression of high mannose. Under these conditions, internalization of S. typhimurium significantly increased, demonstrating that bacteria show preference for particular structures. Finally, we developed a novel assay to measure membrane glycoprotein turnover rates, which revealed that glycan modifications occur by bacterial enzyme activity rather than by host-derived restructuring strategies. This study is the first to provide precise structural information on how host N-glycans are altered to support S. typhimurium invasion."

This strategy would potentially enable the fabrication of thermoelectric devices based on silicon, the cheapest, most integrable and easiest to dope Earth-abundant semiconductor. A drastic reduction of the thermal conductivity, which would lead to a proportional enhancement of the figure of merit, was observed for silicon low-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanowires and ultra-thin membranes. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the phononic properties of the latter, and we show that dimensionality reduction alone is not sufficient to hinder heat transport to a great extent. In turn, the presence of surface roughness at the nanoscale reduces the thermal conductivity of sub-10 nm membranes up to 10 times with respect to bulk."

The experimental data are discussed on the basis of a modified Amonton's law for friction, stating a linear dependence of friction on load plus an adhesive offset accounting for a finite friction force in the limit of null total applied load. Molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction of the AFM tip with the nanostructured carbon confirm the validity of the friction model used for this system. Experimental results show that the friction coefficient is not influenced by the nanostructure of the films nor by the relative humidity. On the other hand the adhesion coefficient depends on these parameters."

They can strongly influence the mechanical properties and electronic and heat transport in graphene. In this work, we employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations to study thermal transport in large suspended polycrystalline graphene samples. Samples of different controlled grain sizes are prepared by a recently developed efficient multiscale approach based on the phase field crystal model. In contrast to previous works, our results show that the scaling of the thermal conductivity with the grain size implies bimodal behavior with two effective Kapitza lengths. The scaling is dominated by the out-of-plane (flexural) phonons with a Kapitza length that is an order of magnitude larger than that of the in-plane phonons. We also show that, to get quantitative agreement with the most recent experiments, quantum corrections need to be applied to both the Kapitza conductance of grain boundaries and the thermal conductivity of pristine graphene, and the corresponding Kapitza lengths must be renormalized accordingly."

All dogs were administered a dose of 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/m2 by intravenous infusion and serum samples were collected at 5, 45 and 60 minutes post-infusion. DOX and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol (doxol), were quantified in serum samples using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Wide interpatient variability was observed in the predicted DOX AUC with a coefficient of variation of 34%. A significant relationship was found between DOX AUC and absolute white blood cell count (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.003), absolute neutrophil count (ANC; P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.002) and surviving fraction of neutrophils (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.03) approximately 1 week after dosing (nadir). No changes in other hematologic parameters (red blood cells, platelets, lymphocytes, haemoglobin) were found to correlate with DOX AUC. The absolute dose (mg) and the dose per unit body weight (mg/kg) were not significantly correlated with nadir ANC. No relationships were found between maximum serum doxol concentration and myelosuppression. Baseline ANC was also significantly correlated to nadir ANC and a model was constructed using baseline ANC and DOX AUC that significantly described the nadir ANC. These findings demonstrate the important relationship between systemic DOX exposure and degree of neutropenia in dogs, and suggest a potential for individualized, pharmacokinetically-guided DOX dosing in dogs."

VBL is characterized by a narrow therapeutic index, with key dose-limiting toxicities being myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of VBL is primarily driven by ABCB1-mediated efflux and CYP3A4 metabolism, creating potential for drug-drug interaction. To characterize sources of variability in VBL PK, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in Mdr1a/b(-/-) knockout and wild-type mice by incorporating key drivers of PK, including ABCB1 efflux, CYP3A4 metabolism, and tissue-specific tubulin binding, and scaled this model to accurately simulate VBL PK in humans and pet dogs. To investigate the capability of the model to capture interindividual variability in clinical data, virtual populations of humans and pet dogs were generated through Monte Carlo simulation of physiologic and biochemical parameters and compared to the clinical PK data. This model provides a foundation for predictive modeling of VBL PK. The base PBPK model can be further improved with supplemental experimental data identifying drug-drug interactions, ABCB1 polymorphisms and expression, and other sources of physiologic or metabolic variability."

The new method is applicable to ab initio simulations with hundreds of atoms containing complex and multimolecular reaction events. A key aspect of nebterpolation is smoothing of the reactive MD trajectory in internal coordinates to initiate the search for the reaction path on the potential energy surface. We apply nebterpolation to analyze the reaction events in an ab initio nanoreactor simulation that discovers new molecules and mechanisms, including a C-C coupling pathway for glycolaldehyde synthesis. We find that the new method, which incorporates information from the MD trajectory that connects reactants with products, produces a dramatically distinct set of minimum energy paths compared to existing approaches that start from information for the reaction end points alone. The energy refinement method described here represents a key component of an emerging simulation paradigm where molecular dynamics simulations are applied to discover the possible reaction mechanisms."

        "abstract": "BackgroundDespite careful clinical examination, procurement biopsy and assessment on hypothermic machine perfusion, a significant number of potentially useable deceased donor kidneys will be discarded because they are deemed unsuitable for transplantation. Ex vivo normothermic perfusion (EVNP) may be useful as a means to further assess high-risk kidneys to determine suitability for transplantation.MethodsFrom June 2014 to October 2015, 7 kidneys (mean donor age, 54.3 years and Kidney Donor Profile Index, 79%) that were initially procured with the intention to transplant were discarded based on a combination of clinical findings, suboptimal biopsies, long cold ischemia time (CIT) and/or poor hypothermic perfusion parameters. They were subsequently placed on EVNP using oxygenated packed red blood cells and supplemental nutrition for a period of 3 hours. Continuous hemodynamic and functional parameters were assessed.ResultsAfter a mean CIT of 43.7 hours, all 7 kidneys appeared viable on EVNP with progressively increasing renal blood flow over the 3-hour period of perfusion. Five of the 7 kidneys had excellent macroscopic appearance, rapid increase in blood flow to 200 to 250 mL/min, urine output of 40 to 260 mL/h and increasing creatinine clearance.ConclusionsFavorable perfusion characteristics and immediate function after a 3-hour course of EVNP suggests that high-risk kidneys subjected to long CIT may have been considered for transplantation. The combined use of ex vivo hypothermic and normothermic perfusion may be a useful strategy to more adequately assess and preserve high-risk kidneys deemed unsuitable for transplantation. A clinical trial will be necessary to validate the usefulness of this approach."

        "abstract": "BackgroundKidney transplantation from hepatitis C seropositive (HCV+) donors may benefit hepatitis C RNA-positive (RNA+) candidates, but it is unclear how the willingness to be listed for and accept such kidneys affects waitlist and transplant outcomes.MethodsIn a single-center retrospective analysis, HCV+ transplant candidates (N = 169) listed from March 2004 to February 2015 were evaluated. All RNA+ candidates were offered the option to be listed for HCV+ donors. RNA- candidates were listed only for HCV- donors.ResultsFifty-seven patients (51% of all RNA+ transplant candidates) willing to accept HCV+ donors were listed for both HCV+ and HCV- donor kidneys. During 6-year follow up, 43 (75%) of 57 patients accepting HCV+ versus 19 (35%) of 55 patients not accepting HCV+ received a deceased donor kidney transplant (P < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that willingness to be listed for and accept HCV+ kidneys was associated with receiving deceased donor kidney transplant (P = 0.0016). Fewer patients accepting HCV+ donors (7 [12%] vs 16 [29%]) were removed from the list due to death or deteriorated medical condition (P = 0.0117). Posttransplant patient and graft survival rates were not significantly different. Overall patient survival since the listing (combined waitlist and posttransplant survival) was similar among the groups.ConclusionsHCV RNA+ candidates had better access to transplantation and similar overall survival before the era of widespread use of direct-acting anti-HCV agents."

Evaluation of podocyte B7-1 expression and treatment with abatacept (a B7-1 antagonist) has shown promise but remains controversial.MethodsFrom 2012 to 2020, twelve patients developed post-KT FSGS with nephrotic range proteinuria, failed conventional therapy, and were treated with abatacept.

        "abstract": "Two studies were conducted to determine how methyl jasmonate (MeJA), jasmonic acid (JA), and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) affect grape berry abscission in the initial days after treatment. The overarching goal was to determine whether JA, with or without ACC, may hold the potential to sufficiently reduce fruit detachment force (FDF) and increase the proportion of berries with dry stem scars while minimizing preharvest abscission, effects that could be useful in the production of stemless table grapes. On Thompson Seedless grapes, JA was at least as effective as MeJA for stimulating berry abscission based on reduced fruit detachment force (FDF) and yielding detached berries with dry stem scars. Further, since previous studies showed that ACC improved MeJA-induced grape abscission, we tested ACC effects on JA activity. We found that JA rapidly induced preharvest berry abscission, confirming previous results. ACC alone did not induce preharvest berry abscission, but ACC improved the effectiveness of JA on reducing FDF and increasing dry stem scar development. These studies also demonstrated that JA-induced abscission occurs within the first day after treatment. Commercial use of JA plus ACC as an abscission agent requires that FDF sufficiently declines, and the incidence of dry stem scars increases, prior to a significant increase in fruit abscission. However, the rapid progression of fruit abscission may require harvest either within 24 and 48 h after treatment or the use of a passive catch system."

Fibroblasts/myofibroblasts are thought to be the major cell type involved in encapsulation, but it is unclear whether and how stem cells contribute to this process. Here we show, for the first time, that Sox10+ adult stem cells contribute to both encapsulation and microvessel formation. Sox10+ adult stem cells were found sparsely in the stroma of subcutaneous loose connective tissues. Upon subcutaneous biomaterial implantation, Sox10+ stem cells were activated and recruited to the biomaterial scaffold, and differentiated into fibroblasts and then myofibroblasts. This differentiation process from Sox10+ stem cells to myofibroblasts could be recapitulated in vitro. On the other hand, Sox10+ stem cells could differentiate into perivascular cells to stabilize newly formed microvessels. Sox10+ stem cells and endothelial cells in three-dimensional co-culture self-assembled into microvessels, and platelet-derived growth factor had chemotactic effect on Sox10+ stem cells. Transplanted Sox10+ stem cells differentiated into smooth muscle cells to stabilize functional microvessels. These findings demonstrate the critical role of adult stem cells in tissue remodeling and unravel the complexity of stem cell fate determination."

        "abstract": "In regenerative medicine applications, the differentiation stage of implanted stem cells must be optimized to control cell fate and enhance therapeutic efficacy. We investigated the therapeutic potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells at two differentiation stages on peripheral nerve regeneration. Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) and Schwann cells (NCSC-SCs) derived from iPSCs were used to construct a tissue-engineered nerve conduit that was applied to bridge injured nerves in a rat sciatic nerve transection model. Upon nerve conduit implantation, the NCSC group showed significantly higher electrophysiological recovery at 1 month as well as better gastrocnemius muscle recovery at 5 months than the acellular group, but the NCSC-SC group didn't. Both transplanted NCSCs and NCSC-SCs interacted with newly-growing host axons, while NCSCs showed better survival rate and distribution. The transplanted NCSCs mainly differentiated into Schwann cells with no teratoma formation, and they secreted higher concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor than NCSC-SCs. In conclusion, transplantation of iPSC-NCSCs accelerated functional nerve recovery with the involvement of stem cell differentiation and paracrine signaling. This study unravels the in vivo performance of stem cells during tissue regeneration, and provides a rationale of using appropriate stem cells for regenerative medicine."

        "abstract": "Extracellular vesicle (EV)-based technologies represent a new advancement for disease treatment. EVs can be administered systemically, injected into the injury site directly, or applied locally in conjunction with bioengineered implantable scaffolds. Matrix-bound vesicles (MBVs), a special class of vesicles localized in association with the extracellular matrix (ECM), have been identified as critical bioactive factors and shown to mediate significant regenerative functions of ECM scaffolds. Loading EVs onto bioscaffolds to mimic the MBV-ECM complex has been shown superior to EV bolus injection in recent in vivo studies, such as in providing enhanced tissue regeneration, EV retention rates, and healing efficacy. Different types of natural biomaterials, synthetic polymers, and ceramics have been developed for EV loading, and these EV functionalized biomaterials have been applied in different areas for disease treatment. The EV functionalized scaffolds can be designed to be biodegradable, off-the-shelf biomaterials as a delivery vehicle for EVs. Overall, the bioengineered EV-loaded bioscaffolds represent a promising approach for cell-free treatment in clinical applications."

Univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics compared responses between groups. Generalized linear modeling, adjusting for program region, size, program leadership role, and number of years in role determined factors associated with need for additional training.ResultsThe response rate was 39.3% (322/820). Most respondents strongly agreed that supporting resident well-being is an important part of their role, but few reported supporting resident well-being as part of their job description. Most reported supporting residents' clinical, personal, and health issues at least annually, and in some cases weekly, with 72% spending >10%of their time on resident well-being. Most program leaders desired more training. After adjusting for level of comfort in dealing with resident well-being issues, program leaders more frequently exposed to resident well-being issues were more likely to desire additional training (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.02).ConclusionsProgram leaders spend a significant amount of time supporting resident well-being. Although they think that supporting resident well-being is an important part of their job, opportunities exist for developing program leaders through including resident wellness on job descriptions and training program leaders how to support resident well-being."

Various lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies have attempted to reduce or prevent ventilator-induced lung injury but few modalities have proven effective. A model that isolates the contribution of mechanical ventilation on the development of acute lung injury is needed to better understand biologic mechanisms that lead to ventilator-induced lung injury.ObjectivesTo evaluate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers in reducing lung injury in a ventilator-induced lung injury murine model in short- and longer-term ventilation.Methods5-12 week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 85) were anesthetized, placed on mechanical ventilation for either 2 hrs or 4 hrs with either low tidal volume (8 ml/kg) or high tidal volume (15 ml/kg) with or without positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers.ResultsAlteration of the alveolar-capillary barrier was noted at 2 hrs of high tidal volume ventilation. Standardized histology scores, influx of bronchoalveolar lavage albumin, proinflammatory cytokines, and absolute neutrophils were significantly higher in the high-tidal volume ventilation group at 4 hours of ventilation. Application of positive end-expiratory pressure resulted in significantly decreased standardized histology scores and bronchoalveolar absolute neutrophil counts at low- and high-tidal volume ventilation, respectively. Recruitment maneuvers were essential to maintain pulmonary compliance at both 2 and 4 hrs of ventilation.ConclusionsSigns of ventilator-induced lung injury are evident soon after high tidal volume ventilation (as early as 2 hours) and lung injury worsens with longer-term ventilation (4 hrs). Application of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers are protective against worsening VILI across all time points. Dynamic compliance can be used guide the frequency of recruitment maneuvers to help ameloriate ventilator-induced lung injury."

In terms of global root-mean-squared error metrics, this high-resolution simulation is generally superior to results from the low-resolution configuration of E3SMv1 (due to resolution, tuning changes, and possibly initialization procedure) and compares favorably to models in the CMIP5 ensemble. Ocean and sea ice simulation is particularly improved, due to better resolution of bathymetry, the ability to capture more variability and extremes in winds and currents, and the ability to resolve mesoscale ocean eddies. The largest improvement in this regard is an ice-free Labrador Sea, which is a major problem at low resolution. Interestingly, several features found to improve with resolution in previous studies are insensitive to resolution or even degrade in E3SMv1. Most notable in this regard are warm bias and associated stratocumulus deficiency in eastern subtropical oceans and lack of improvement in El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o. Another major finding of this study is that resolution increase had negligible impact on climate sensitivity (measured by net feedback determined through uniform +4K prescribed sea surface temperature increase) and aerosol sensitivity. Cloud response to resolution increase consisted of very minor decrease at all levels. Large-scale patterns of precipitation bias were also relatively unaffected by grid spacing."

        "abstract": "Filaments of intense vapor transport called atmospheric rivers (ARs) are responsible for the majority of poleward vapor transport in the midlatitudes. Despite their importance to the hydrologic cycle, there remain many unanswered questions about changes to ARs in a warming climate. In this study we perform a series of escalating uniform SST increases (+2, +4, and +6K, respectively) in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 in an aquaplanet configuration to evaluate the thermodynamic and dynamical response of AR vapor content, transport, and precipitation to warming SSTs. We find that AR column integrated water vapor (IWV) is especially sensitive to SST and increases by 6.3-9.7% per degree warming despite decreasing relative humidity through much of the column. Further analysis provides a more nuanced view of AR IWV changes: Since SST warming is modest compared to that in the midtroposphere, computing fractional changes in IWV with respect to SST results in finding spuriously large increases. Meanwhile, results here show that AR IWV transport increases relatively uniformly with temperature and at consistently lower rates than IWV, as modulated by systematically decreasing low-level wind speeds. Similarly, changes in AR precipitation are related to a compensatory relationship between enhanced near-surface moisture and damped vertical motions."

Few studies have compared different antifibrinolytic types with respect to blood loss and transfusion rates. We sought to compare the blood loss and transfusion rates between epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), tranexamic acid (TXA), and control.MethodsA total of 564 patients underwent primary total hip or total knee arthroplasty at our institution. Patients were divided into 3 groups: 183 EACA, 204 TXA, and 177 control. Patient demographics, hemoglobin, transfusion rates, and blood loss were collected.ResultsPatient preoperative variables were similar. The control group had a mean estimated blood loss (EBL) of 1.48 L, with 51 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) given and 14.7% of patients receiving a blood transfusion. The EACA group had an EBL of 1.33 L, with 20 pRBCs given and 10.9% of patients receiving a transfusion. The TXA group had an EBL of 1.05 L, with 3 pRBCs transfused in 0.98% of patients. Compared with the control group, blood loss (P = 0.0014; P < 0.0001), number of pRBCs given (P = 0.007; P < 0.0001), and number of patients transfused (P = 0.012; P < 0.0001) were significantly lower in the EACA and TXA groups, respectively. TXA had significantly lower blood loss (P < 0.0001), lower number of tranfusions (P = 0.005), and less patients transfused (P = 0.003) compared with EACA.ConclusionOur study reports lower blood loss, transfusion rates, and number of patients needing transfusion with both EACA and TXA in the setting of total joint arthroplasty. When comparing between EACA and TXA, TXA had lower blood loss, transfusion rates, and number of patients requiring transfusion."

We developed a clinical prediction score to identify elderly dialysis patients with expected 5-year survival appropriate for kidney transplantation (>5 years).MethodsIncident dialysis patients in 2006-2009 aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a570 were identified from the United States Renal Data System database and divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Using the derivation cohort, candidate variables with a significant crude association with 5-year all-cause mortality were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to generate a scoring system. The scoring system was tested in the validation cohort and a cohort of elderly transplant recipients.ResultsCharacteristics most predictive of 5-year mortality included age >80, body mass index (BMI) <18, the presence of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immobility, and being institutionalized. Factors associated with increased 5-year survival were non-white race, a primary cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) other than diabetes, employment within 6 months of dialysis initiation, and dialysis start via arteriovenous fistula (AVF). 5-year mortality was 47% for the lowest risk score group (3.6% of the validation cohort) and >90% for the highest risk cohort (42% of the validation cohort).ConclusionThis clinical prediction score could be useful for physicians to identify potentially suitable candidates for kidney transplantation."

        "abstract": "Pollen collection is necessary for bee survival and important for flowering plant reproduction, yet if and how pollen extraction motor routines are modified with experience is largely unknown. Here, we used an automated reward and monitoring system to evaluate modification in a common pollen-extraction routine, floral sonication. Through a series of laboratory experiments with the bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, we examined whether variation in sonication frequency and acceleration is due to instrumental learning based on rewards, a fixed behavioral response to rewards, and/or a mechanical constraint. We first investigated whether bees could learn to adjust their sonication frequency in response to pollen rewards given only for specified frequency ranges and found no evidence of instrumental learning. However, we found that absence versus receipt of a pollen reward did lead to a predictable behavioral response, which depended on bee size. Finally, we found some evidence of mechanical constraints, in that flower mass affected sonication acceleration (but not frequency) through an interaction with bee size. In general, larger bees showed more flexibility in sonication frequency and acceleration, potentially reflecting a size-based constraint on the range over which smaller bees can modify frequency and acceleration. Overall, our results show that although bees did not display instrumental learning of sonication frequency, their sonication motor routine is nevertheless flexible."

        "abstract": "Snowmelt is a significant source of carbon, nutrient, and sediment loads to many mountain lakes. The mixing conditions of snowmelt inflows, which are heavily dependent on the interplay between snowmelt and lake thermal regime, dictate the fate of these loads within lakes and their ultimate impact on lake ecosystems. We use five decades of data from Lake Tahoe, a 600 year residence-time lake where snowmelt has little influence on lake temperature, to characterize the snowmelt mixing response to a range of climate conditions. Using stream discharge and lake profile data (1968\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2017), we find that the proportion of annual snowmelt entering the lake prior to the onset of stratification increases as annual snowpack decreases, ranging from about 50% in heavy-snow years to close to 90% in warm, dry years. Accordingly, in 8 recent years (2010\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2017) where hourly inflow buoyancy and discharge could be quantified, we find that decreased snowpack similarly increases the proportion of annual snowmelt entering the lake at weak to positive buoyancy. These responses are due to the stronger effect of winter precipitation conditions on streamflow timing and temperature than on lake stratification, and point toward increased nearshore and near-surface mixing of inflows in low-snowpack years. The response of inflow mixing conditions to snowpack is apparent when isolating temperature effects on snowpack. Snowpack levels are decreasing due to warming temperatures during winter precipitation. Thus, our findings suggest that climate change may lead to increased deposition of inflow loads in the ecologically dynamic littoral zone of high-residence time, snowmelt-fed lakes."

This requires an understanding of ecological resilience: the ability of an ecosystem to return to the same state following a perturbation, which can strongly depend on species interactions across trophic levels. We use a structured model of a temperate rocky reef to explore how multi-trophic level fisheries impact ecological resilience. Increasing fishing mortality of prey (urchins) has a minor effect on equilibrium biomass of kelp, urchins, and spiny lobster predators, but increases resilience by reducing the range of predator harvest rates at which alternative stable states are possible. Size-structured predation on urchins acts as the feedback maintaining each state. Our results demonstrate that the resilience of ecosystems strongly depends on the interactive effects of predator and prey harvest in multi-trophic level fisheries, which are common in marine ecosystems but are unaccounted for by traditional management."

Interventions that rectify \u00ce\u00b2-cell dysfunction and loss are essential to combat this deadly malady. In the current study, we sought to delineate the role of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in \u00ce\u00b2-cells under diet-induced metabolic stress. The expression of sEH was upregulated in murine and macaque diabetes models and islets of diabetic human patients. We postulated that hyperglycemia-induced elevation in sEH leads to a reduction in its substrates, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), and attenuates the function of \u00ce\u00b2-cells. Genetic deficiency of sEH potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mice, likely in a cell-autonomous manner, contributing to better systemic glucose control. Consistent with this observation, genetic and pharmacological inactivation of sEH and the treatment with EETs exhibited insulinotropic effects in isolated murine islets ex vivo. Additionally, sEH deficiency enhanced glucose sensing and metabolism with elevated ATP and cAMP concentrations. This phenotype was associated with attenuated oxidative stress and diminished \u00ce\u00b2-cell death in sEH deficient islets. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of sEH in vivo mitigated, albeit partly, high fat diet-induced \u00ce\u00b2-cell loss and dedifferentiation. The current observations provide new insights into the role of sEH in \u00ce\u00b2-cells and information that may be leveraged for the development of a mechanism-based intervention to rectify \u00ce\u00b2-cell dysfunction and loss."

The objective of our study was to determine the molecular effects of an HGD on hippocampal microvessels and cognitive function and determine if a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor (sEHI), known to be vasculoprotective and anti-inflammatory, modulates these effects. Wild type male mice were fed a low glycemic diet (LGD, 12% sucrose/weight) or an HGD (34% sucrose/weight) with/without the sEHI, trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB), for 12 weeks. Brain hippocampal microvascular gene expression was assessed by microarray and data analyzed using a multi-omic approach for differential expression of protein and non-protein-coding genes, gene networks, functional pathways, and transcription factors. Global hippocampal microvascular gene expression was fundamentally different for mice fed the HGD vs. the LGD. The HGD response was characterized by differential expression of 608 genes involved in cell signaling, neurodegeneration, metabolism, and cell adhesion/inflammation/oxidation effects reversible by t-AUCB and hence sEH inhibitor correlated with protection against Alzheimer's dementia. Ours is the first study to demonstrate that high dietary glycemia contributes to brain hippocampal microvascular inflammation through sEH."

Having a better understanding of the beliefs and practices of trauma and acute care surgeons regarding discharge pain management may offer potential targets for interventions beyond fixed legal mandates.MethodsAn Institutional Review Board-approved electronic survey was sent to trauma and acute care surgeons who are members of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, and trauma and acute care surgeons and nurse practitioners at a Level 1 trauma center in February 2018. The survey included four case-based scenarios and questions about discharge prescription practices and beliefs.ResultsOf 66 respondents, most (88.1%) were at academic institutions. Mean number of opioid tablets prescribed was 20-30 (range 5-90), with the fewest tablets prescribed for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the most for rib fractures. Few prescribed both opioid and non-opioid medications (22.4% to 31.4 %). Most would not change the number/strength of medications (69.2%), dose (53.9%), or number of tablets of opioids (83.1%) prescribed if patients used opioids regularly prior to their operation. The most common factors that made providers more likely to prescribe opioids were high inpatient opioid use (32.4%), history of opioid use/abuse (24.5%), and if the patient lives far from the hospital (12.9%). Most providers in practice >5 years reported a decrease in opioids (71.9%) prescribed at discharge.ConclusionTrauma and acute care surgeons and nurse practitioners reported decreasing the number/amount of opioids prescribed over time. Patients with high opioid use in the hospital, history of opioid use/abuse, or who live far from the provider may be prescribed more opioids at discharge.Level of evidenceLevel IV."

Success relies on institutional support and focused training in arterial access. We hypothesized that hospitals with higher REBOA volumes will be more successful than low-volume hospitals at aortic occlusion with REBOA.MethodsThis is a retrospective study from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery Registry from November 2013 to January 2018. Patients aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a518&nbsp;y who underwent REBOA were included. Successful placement of REBOA catheters (defined as hemodynamic improvement with balloon inflation) was compared between high-volume (\u00e2\u2030\u00a580 cases; two hospitals), mid-volume (10-20 cases; four hospitals), and low-volume (<10 cases; 14 hospitals) hospitals, adjusting for patient factors.ResultsOf 271 patients from 20 hospitals, 210 patients (77.5%) had successful REBOA placement. Most patients were male (76.0%) and sustained blunt trauma (78.1%). cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was ongoing at the time of REBOA placement in 34.5% of patients. Inpatient mortality was 67.4%, unchanged by hospital volume. Multivariable logistic regression found increased odds of successful REBOA placement at high-volume versus low-volume hospitals (odds ratio [OR], 7.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.10-27.29; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.002) and mid-volume versus low-volume hospitals (OR, 7.82; 95% CI, 1.52-40.31; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.014) and decreased odds among patients undergoing CPR during REBOA placement (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; P&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001) when adjusting for age, sex, mechanism of injury, prehospital CPR, CPR on admission, transfer status, hospital location of REBOA placement, Glasgow Coma Scale \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 13, and injury severity.ConclusionsHospitals with higher REBOA volumes were more likely to achieve hemodynamic improvement with REBOA inflation. However, mortality and complication rates were unchanged. Independent of hospital volume, ongoing CPR is associated with a decreased odds of successful REBOA placement."

We hypothesized that there are pediatric patients who may benefit from REBOA.MethodsTrauma patients <18\u00e2\u20ac\u00afyears old at a level 1 pediatric trauma center between 2009 and 2019 were queried for deaths, pre-hospital cardiac arrest, massive transfusion protocol activation, transfusion requirement, or hemorrhage control surgery. These patients defined the cohort of severely injured patients. From this cohort, patients with intraabdominal injuries for which REBOA may provide temporary hemorrhage control were identified, including solid organ injury necessitating intervention, vascular injury, or pelvic hemorrhage.ResultsThere were 239 severely injured patients out of 6538 pediatric traumas.

Although elevated ROS production and elevated biomarkers of oxidative stress have been found in tissues from children with autism spectrum disorders, evidence for damage to mtDNA is lacking. Findings mtDNA deletions were evaluated in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMC) isolated from 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 year old children with full autism (AU; n = 67), and typically developing children (TD; n = 46) and their parents enrolled in the CHildhood Autism Risk from Genes and Environment study (CHARGE) at University of California Davis. Sequence variants were evaluated in mtDNA segments from AU and TD children (n = 10; each) and their mothers representing 31.2% coverage of the entire human mitochondrial genome. Increased mtDNA damage in AU children was evidenced by (i) higher frequency of mtDNA deletions (2-fold), (ii) higher number of GC\u00e2\u2020\u2019AT transitions (2.4-fold), being GC preferred sites for oxidative damage, and (iii) higher frequency of G,C,T\u00e2\u2020\u2019A transitions (1.6-fold) suggesting a higher incidence of polymerase gamma incorporating mainly A at bypassed apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, probably originated from oxidative stress. The last two outcomes were identical to their mothers suggesting the inheritance of a template consistent with increased oxidative damage, whereas the frequency of mtDNA deletions in AU children was similar to that of their fathers. Conclusions These results suggest that a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors, taking place during perinatal periods, results in a mtDNA template in children with autism similar to that expected for older individuals."

Here, for the first time, we show that Zdhhc13 plays a key role in anxiety-related behaviors and motor function, as well as brain bioenergetics, in a mouse model (luc) carrying a spontaneous Zdhhc13 recessive mutation. At 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2030m of age, mutant mice displayed increased sensorimotor gating, anxiety, hypoactivity, and decreased motor coordination, compared to littermate controls. Loss of Zdhhc13 in cortex and cerebellum from 3- and 24\u00e2\u20ac\u2030m old hetero- and homozygous male mutant mice resulted in lower levels of Drp1 S-palmitoylation accompanied by altered mitochondrial dynamics, increased glycolysis, glutaminolysis and lactic acidosis, and neurotransmitter imbalances. Employing in vivo and in vitro models, we identified that Zdhhc13-dependent Drp1 S-palmitoylation, which acting alone or in concert, enables the normal occurrence of the fission-fusion process. In vitro and in vivo direct Zdhhc13-Drp1 protein interaction was observed, confirming Drp1 as a substrate of Zdhhc13. Abnormal fission-fusion processes result in disrupted mitochondria morphology and distribution affecting not only mitochondrial ATP output but neurotransmission and integrity of synaptic structures in the brain, setting the basis for the behavioral abnormalities described in the Zdhhc13-deficient mice."

In parallel, quantitative measurements of tremor and ataxia and neuropsychological evaluations of mental state, executive function, learning, memory, and psychological symptoms were assessed at the same time points. Allopregnanolone treatment impacted significantly GABA metabolism, oxidative stress, and some of the mitochondria-related outcomes. Notably, the magnitude of the individual metabolic response, as well as the correlation with some of the behavioral tests, was overwhelmingly carrier-specific.

        "abstract": "The underpinnings of mild to moderate neurodevelopmental delay remain elusive, often leading to late diagnosis and interventions. Here, we present data on exome and genome sequencing as well as array analysis of 13 individuals that point to pathogenic, heterozygous, mostly de novo variants in WDFY3 (significant de novo enrichment P = 0.003) as a monogenic cause of mild and non-specific neurodevelopmental delay. Nine variants were protein-truncating and four missense. Overlapping symptoms included neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, macrocephaly, and psychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorders/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). One proband presented with an opposing phenotype of microcephaly and the only missense-variant located in the PH-domain of WDFY3. Findings of this case are supported by previously published data, demonstrating that pathogenic PH-domain variants can lead to microcephaly via canonical Wnt-pathway upregulation. In a separate study, we reported that the autophagy scaffolding protein WDFY3 is required for cerebral cortical size regulation in mice, by controlling proper division of neural progenitors. Here, we show that proliferating cortical neural progenitors of human embryonic brains highly express WDFY3, further supporting a role for this molecule in the regulation of prenatal neurogenesis. We present data on Wnt-pathway dysregulation in Wdfy3-haploinsufficient mice, which display macrocephaly and deficits in motor coordination and associative learning, recapitulating the human phenotype. Consequently, we propose that in humans WDFY3 loss-of-function variants lead to macrocephaly via downregulation of the Wnt pathway. In summary, we present WDFY3 as a novel gene linked to mild to moderate neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability and conclude that variants putatively causing haploinsufficiency lead to macrocephaly, while an opposing pathomechanism due to variants in the PH-domain of WDFY3 leads to microcephaly."

Currently, no effective treatment is available. We performed an open-label intervention study to assess whether allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid promoting regeneration and repair, can improve clinical symptoms, brain activity, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements in patients with FXTAS. Six patients underwent weekly intravenous infusions of allopregnanolone (2-6 mg over 30&nbsp;min) for 12&nbsp;weeks. All patients completed baseline and follow-up studies, though MRI scans were not collected from 1 patient because of MRI contraindications. The MRI scans from previous visits, along with scans from 8 age-matched male controls, were also included to establish patients' baseline condition as a reference. Functional outcomes included quantitative measurements of tremor and ataxia and neuropsychological evaluations. Brain activity consisted of event-related potential N400 word repetition effect during a semantic memory processing task. Structural MRI outcomes comprised volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities, and microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum. The results of the study showed that allopregnanolone infusions were well tolerated in all subjects. Before treatment, the patients disclosed impairment in executive function, verbal fluency and learning, and progressive deterioration of all MRI measurements. After treatment, the patients demonstrated improvement in executive functioning, episodic memory and learning, and increased N400 repetition effect amplitude. Although MRI changes were not significant as a group, both improved and deteriorated MRI measurements occurred in individual patients in contrast to uniform deterioration before the treatment. Significant correlations between baseline MRI measurements and changes in neuropsychological test scores indicated the effects of allopregnanolone on improving executive function, learning, and memory for patients with relatively preserved hippocampus and corpus callosum, while reducing psychological symptoms for patients with small hippocampi and amygdalae. The findings show the promise of allopregnanolone in improving cognitive functioning in patients with FXTAS and in partially alleviating some aspects of neurodegeneration. Further studies are needed to verify the efficacy of allopregnanolone for treating FXTAS."

The recent availability of whole genome sequences has created the opportunity to develop a next generation, high-density equine SNP array.ResultsUsing whole genome sequence from 153 individuals representing 24 distinct breeds collated by the equine genomics community, we cataloged over 23 million de novo discovered genetic variants. Leveraging genotype data from individuals with both whole genome sequence, and genotypes from lower-density, legacy SNP arrays, a subset of ~5 million high-quality, high-density array candidate SNPs were selected based on breed representation and uniform spacing across the genome. Considering probe design recommendations from a commercial vendor (Affymetrix, now Thermo Fisher Scientific) a set of ~2 million SNPs were selected for a next-generation high-density SNP chip (MNEc2M).

The objective of this study was to phenotype a population of 100 horses from five different breeds and assess differences in the metabolic activity of the equine CYP2D6 homolog using codeine as a probe drug. Administration of a probe drug is a common method used for patient phenotyping in human medicine, whereby the ratio of parent drug to metabolite (metabolic ratio, MR) can be used to compare relative enzyme function between individuals. A single oral dose of codeine (0.6\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/kg) was administered and plasma concentrations of codeine and its metabolites were determined using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The MR of codeine O-demethylation [(codeine)/(morphine + morphine-3-glucuronide + morphine-6-glucuronide)] was determined using the area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated from time zero to infinity (AUC0-\u00e2\u02c6\u017e) for each analyte and used to group horses into predicted phenotypes (high-, moderate-, and low-MR).ResultsThe MR of codeine O-demethylation ranged from 0.002 to 0.147 (median 0.018) among all horses. No significant difference in MR was observed between breeds, age, or sex. Of the 100 horses, 11 were classified as high-MR, 72 moderate-MR, and 17 low-MR.

The range of codeine metabolism observed among horses suggests the presence of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D82 of which codeine is a known substrate. Additional studies including CYP2D82 genotyping of high- and low-MR individuals are necessary to determine the presence of CYP2D polymorphisms and their functional implications with respect to the metabolism of therapeutics."

Allele frequency (AF): Publicly available data from 504 horses across 47 breeds.MethodsRetrospective, case control study. Whole-genome sequencing was performed and genetic variants identified within 28 vitamin E candidate genes. These variants were subsequently genotyped in the validation cohort.ResultsThirty-nine confirmed variants in 15 vitamin E candidate genes were significantly associated with eNAD/EDM (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.01). In the validation cohort, 2 intronic CD36 variants (chr4:726485 and chr4:731082) were significantly associated with eNAD/EDM in clinical (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20302.78\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c3\u2014\u00e2\u20ac\u203010-4 and P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20304\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c3\u2014\u00e2\u20ac\u203010-4 , respectively) and PM-confirmed cases (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20306.32\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c3\u2014\u00e2\u20ac\u203010-6 and 1.04\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c3\u2014\u00e2\u20ac\u203010-5 , respectively). Despite the significant association, variant AFs were low in the postmortem-confirmed eNAD/EDM cases (0.22-0.26). In publicly available equine genomes, AFs ranged from 0.06 to 0.1.Conclusions and clinical importanceMany PM-confirmed cases of eNAD/EDM were wild-type for the 2 intronic CD36 SNPs, suggesting either a false positive association or genetic heterogeneity of eNAD/EDM within the QH breed."

Ganaxolone, a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, is hypothesized to improve symptoms such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and attention deficits in children with FXS.MethodsThis study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ganaxolone in children with FXS, aged 6-17&nbsp;years.ResultsSixty-one participants were assessed for eligibility, and 59 were randomized to the study. Fifty-five participants completed at least the first arm and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 51 participants completed both treatment arms. There were no statistically significant improvements observed on the primary outcome measure (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement), the key secondary outcome measure (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale-R), or any other secondary outcome measures in the overall study population. However, post-hoc analyses revealed positive trends in areas of anxiety, attention, and hyperactivity in participants with higher baseline anxiety and low full-scale IQ scores. No serious adverse events (AEs) occurred, although there was a significant increase in the frequency and severity of AEs related to ganaxolone compared to placebo.ConclusionsWhile ganaxolone was found to be safe, there were no significant improvements in the outcome measures in the overall study population. However, ganaxolone in subgroups of children with FXS, including those with higher anxiety or lower cognitive abilities, might have beneficial effects.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01725152."

        "abstract": "ObjectiveContinuous chest compressions are more effective during resuscitation in adults. Sustained inflation rapidly establishes functional residual capacity in fluid-filled lungs at birth. We sought to compare the hemodynamics and success in achieving return of spontaneous circulation in an asphyxial cardiac arrest lamb model with transitioning fetal circulation and fluid-filled lungs between subjects receiving continuous chest compressions during sustained inflation and those receiving conventional 3:1 compression-to-ventilation resuscitation.DesignProspective, randomized, animal model study.SettingAn experimental laboratory.SubjectsFourteen newborn term gestation lambs.InterventionsLambs were randomized into two groups: 3:1 compression-to-ventilation (control) and continuous chest compressions during sustained inflation. The umbilical cord was occluded to induce asphyxia and asystole. The control group was resuscitated per NRP guidelines. In the sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions group, sustained inflation at 35\u00e2\u20ac\u2030cm H2O was provided for 30 seconds with 1-second interruptions before another sustained inflation was provided. One hundred twenty chest compressions/min started after the initial sustained inflation. The first dose of IV epinephrine was given at 6 minutes if return of spontaneous circulation was not achieved and then every 3 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation or for a total of four doses.Measurement and resultsAll lambs achieved return of spontaneous circulation in a comparable median time (interquartile range) of 390 seconds (225-405\u00e2\u20ac\u2030s) and 345 seconds (204-465\u00e2\u20ac\u2030s) in the sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions and control groups, respectively. Four of seven (sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions) and three of six (control) lambs required epinephrine to achieve return of spontaneous circulation. Diastolic blood pressures were lower in the sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions (4\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u20ac\u20302\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm Hg) compared to the control group (7\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b1\u00e2\u20ac\u20302\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm Hg), p < 0.05. PaCO2, PaO2, and lactate were similar between the groups during the study period.ConclusionIn this perinatal cardiac arrest lamb model with transitioning fetal circulation and fluid-filled lungs, sustained inflation + continuous chest compressions is as effective as 3:1 compression-to-ventilation resuscitation in achieving return of spontaneous circulation. Half the lambs achieved return of spontaneous circulation without epinephrine. continuous chest compressions during sustained inflation reduced diastolic pressures but did not alter gas exchange or carotid blood flow compared to 3:1 compression-to-ventilation resuscitation."

        "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough often associated with holoprosencephaly, little detail of the histopathology of cyclopia is available. Here, we describe the ocular findings in a case of trisomy 13 to better understand the histogenesis of the rosettes, or tubules, characteristic of the retinal dysplasia associated with this condition.MethodsA full pediatric autopsy was performed of a near term infant who died shortly after birth from multiple congenital anomalies including fused facial-midline structures. A detailed histopathological study of the ocular structures was performed. The expression of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), cellular retinal-binding protein (CRALBP), rod opsin, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) were studied by immunohistochemistry.ResultsHoloprosencephaly, and a spectrum of anatomical findings characteristic of Patau's syndrome, were found. Cytogenetic studies demonstrated trisomy 13 [47, XY, +13]. The eyes were fused but contained two developed separate lenses. In contrast, the cornea, and angle structures were hypoplastic, and the anterior chamber had failed to form. The retina showed areas of normally laminated neural retina, whereas in other areas it was replaced by numerous neuronal rosettes. Histological and immunohistochemical studies revealed that the rosettes were composed of differentiated retinal neurons and M\u00c3\u00bcller cell glia. In normally laminated retina, Shh expression was restricted to retinal-ganglion cells, and to a population of neurons in the inner zone of the outer nuclear layer. In contrast, Shh could not be detected in the dysplastic rosettes.ConclusionThe histopathology of cyclopia appears to be more complex than what may have been previously appreciated. In fact, the terms \"cyclopia\" and \"synophthalmia\" are misnomers as the underlying mechanism is a failure of the eyes to form separately during development. The rosettes found in the dysplastic retina are fundamentally different than those of retinoblastoma, being composed of a variety of differentiated cell types. The dysplastic rosettes are essentially laminated retina failing to establish a polarized orientation, resulting in the formation of tubules. Finally, our findings suggest that defective ganglion cell Shh expression may contribute to the ocular pathology of cyclopia."

The guides were used to create drill tracts in these vertebrae by both an experienced and a novice surgeon, and CT imaging was repeated. The entry point and angulation of actual and planned drill tracts were compared for both surgeons. Unintended cortical violations were also assessed by using a modified Zdichavsky classification.ResultsFifty-eight drill tracts were created in 30 vertebrae. Mean entry point deviation was 1.4\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm (range, 0.4-3.4), and mean angular deviation was 5.1\u00c2\u00b0 (range, 1.5\u00c2\u00b0-10.8\u00c2\u00b0). There were no differences between surgeons in entry point deviation (P = .07) or angular deviation (P = .22). There were no unintended cortical bone violations, and all drill tracts were classified as modified Zdichavsky grade I.ConclusionThe 3-D printed guides used in the current study yielded drill tracts with small linear and angular errors from intended paths and 100% accuracy for placement within vertebral pedicles and bodies. This technique was conveniently used by both an experienced and a novice surgeon.Clinical significanceThis technique might be immediately applicable to clinical cases requiring thoracic vertebral stabilization and may allow safe and accurate implant placement for surgeons with varying experience levels."

Maximum axial thrust force, maximum drill torque, integral of force and displacement, change in temperature, maximum power spectral density of the torque signal, torque vibration, and torque and angle at the yield and failure points were collected. Pre- and postyield stiffness, yield and failure energies, and postyield energy were calculated.ResultsThe work required to drill through the cis- and transcortices (integral of force and displacement) was greater for the K-wire, followed by the acrylic and then standard drill bits, respectively. The K-wire demonstrated higher maximum torque than the drill bits at the ciscortex, and the force of drilling was significantly greater. The vibration data was greater with the acrylic and standard drill bits than the K-wire. There was no difference in torsional strength between drilling types.Clinical relevanceMechanical differences exist between different drill bits and K-wire and demonstrate that the K-wire is overall more damaging than the surgical drill bit."

        "abstract": "AbstractBacterial attachment on surfaces is an important biological and industrial concern. Many parameters affect cell attachment behavior, including surface roughness and other topographical features. An understanding of these relationships is critical in the light of recent outbreaks caused by foodborne bacteria. Postharvest packing lines have been identified as a potential source of cross-contamination with pathogens, which can cause subsequent foodborne illness. The objective of this article is to evaluate the influence of surface topographical features on bacterial attachment at various processing temperatures to determine the extent of bacterial colonization. Type 304 stainless steel surfaces and pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes Scott A were used for a detailed investigation. Two commonly used surface types, extruded and ground, were evaluated to determine differences in bacterial attachment on the same type of material. Fifteen surface topography parameters at three processing temperatures were studied to evaluate possible correlations with microbial attachment on these surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy were used for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of surfaces. An analysis of variance and multivariate regression analysis were used to predict the attachment behavior of L. monocytogenes Scott A on stainless steel surfaces. Surface isotropy, average surface roughness, surface spacing, and processing temperatures were strongly correlated with bacterial attachment on 304 stainless steel material.Highlights"

        "abstract": "Nanoparticle-based theranostic agents have emerged as a new paradigm in nanomedicine field for integration of multimodal imaging and therapeutic functions within a single platform. However, the clinical translation of these agents is severely limited by the complexity of fabrication, long-term toxicity of the materials, and unfavorable biodistributions. Here we report an extremely simple and robust approach to develop highly versatile and biocompatible theranostic poly(vinyl alcohol)-porphyrin nanoparticles (PPNs). Through a \"one-pot\" fabrication process, including the chelation of metal ions and encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs, monodispersenanoparticle could be formed by self-assembly of a very simple and biocompatible building block (poly(vinyl alcohol)-porphyrin conjugate). Using this approach, we could conveniently produce multifunctional PPNs that integrate optical imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT) and drug delivery functions in one formulation. PPNs exhibited unique architecture-dependent fluorescence self-quenching, as well as photodynamic- and photothermal- properties. Near-infrared fluorescence could be amplified upon PPN dissociation, providing feasibility of low-background fluorescence imaging. Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded PPNs achieved 53 times longer half-life in blood circulation than free DOX. Upon irradiation by near infrared light at a single excitation wavelength, PPNs could be activated to release reactive oxygen species, heat and drugs simultaneously at the tumor sites in mice bearing tumor xenograft, resulting in complete eradication of tumors. Due to their organic compositions, PPNs showed no obvious cytotoxicity in mice via intravenous administration during therapeutic studies. This highly versatile and multifunctional PPN theranostic nanoplatform showed great potential for the integration of multimodal imaging and therapeutic functions towards personalized nanomedicine against cancers."

        "abstract": "Voltage-gated potassium (KV ) channels are key regulators of vascular smooth muscle contractility and vascular tone, and thus have major influence on the microcirculation. KV channels are important determinants of vascular smooth muscle membrane potential (Em ). A number of KV subunits are expressed in the plasma membrane of smooth muscle cells. Each subunit confers distinct kinetics and regulatory properties that allow for fine control of Em to orchestrate vascular tone. Modifications in KV subunit expression and/or channel activity can contribute to changes in vascular smooth muscle contractility in response to different stimuli and in diverse pathological conditions. Consistent with this, a number of studies suggest alterations in KV subunit expression and/or function as underlying contributing mechanisms for small resistance artery dysfunction in pathologies such as hypertension and metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Here, we review our current knowledge on the effects of these pathologies on KV channel expression and function in vascular smooth muscle cells, and the repercussions on (micro)vascular function."

        "abstract": "Anxiety disorders impose a staggering burden on public health, underscoring the need to develop a deeper understanding of the distributed neural circuits underlying extreme fear and anxiety. Recent work highlights the importance of the central extended amygdala, including the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and neighboring bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST). Anatomical data indicate that the Ce and BST form a tightly interconnected unit, where different kinds of threat-relevant information can be integrated to assemble states of fear and anxiety. Neuroimaging studies show that the Ce and BST are engaged by a broad spectrum of potentially threat-relevant cues. Mechanistic work demonstrates that the Ce and BST are critically involved in organizing defensive responses to a wide range of threats. Studies in rodents have begun to reveal the specific molecules, cells, and microcircuits within the central extended amygdala that underlie signs of fear and anxiety, but the relevance of these tantalizing discoveries to human experience and disease remains unclear. Using a combination of focal perturbations and whole-brain imaging, a new generation of nonhuman primate studies is beginning to close this gap. This work opens the door to discovering the mechanisms underlying neuroimaging measures linked to pathological fear and anxiety, to understanding how the Ce and BST interact with one another and with distal brain regions to govern defensive responses to threat, and to developing improved intervention strategies."

We validated a nonhuman primate model of early-life AT and identified the dorsal amygdala as a core component of AT's neural circuit. Here, we combine RNA sequencing, viral-vector gene manipulation, functional brain imaging, and behavioral phenotyping to uncover AT's molecular substrates.MethodsIn response to potential threat, AT and brain metabolism were assessed in 46 young rhesus monkeys. We identified AT-related transcripts using RNA-sequencing data from dorsal amygdala tissue (including central nucleus of the amygdala [Ce] and dorsal regions of the basal nucleus). Based on the results, we overexpressed the neurotrophin-3 gene, NTF3, in the dorsal amygdala using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging-guided surgery (n&nbsp;= 5 per group).ResultsThis discovery-based approach identified AT-related alterations in the expression of well-established and novel genes, including an inverse association between NTRK3 expression and AT. NTRK3 is an interesting target because it is a relatively unexplored neurotrophic factor that modulates intracellular neuroplasticity pathways. Overexpression of the transcript for NTRK3's endogenous ligand, NTF3, in the dorsal amygdala resulted in reduced AT and altered function in AT's neural circuit.ConclusionsTogether, these data implicate neurotrophin-3/NTRK3 signaling in the dorsal amygdala in mediating primate anxiety. More generally, this approach provides an important step toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of early-life AT and will be useful in guiding the development of treatments to prevent the development of stress-related psychopathology."

We sought to determine if the expression of CSC markers (aldehyde dehydrogenase [ALDH], CD44, and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) predicted outcomes in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients.MethodsWe queried an institutional database of 23 STS patients and evaluated immunohistochemical expression of CSC markers ALDH, CD44, and EGFR. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was also queried for STS clinical and genomic data. Disease-specific (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by univariate and Kaplan-Meier analysis.ResultsOf the 23 institutional patients, the majority was female, had high-grade tumors and had extremity tumors. With a median follow-up of 27&nbsp;months, nine patients (39%) experienced distant recurrence, and four (17%) died of disease. Mean H-scores at diagnosis (\u00c2\u00b1standard error of the mean) for CD44, ALDH1, and EGFR were 169&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b1&nbsp;27, 77&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b1&nbsp;15, and 144&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b1&nbsp;23, respectively. On univariate analysis, there was a trend for increased CD44 score to predict both worse DSS and OS (hazard ratio&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.01, 95% confidence interval 1-1.02, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.056), whereas ALDH and EGFR scores did not. Analysis of 74 TCGA STS cases with complete clinical and genomic data revealed that CD44 copy number alterations predicted worse DSS (9.89&nbsp;months versus 72.5&nbsp;months, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.007) and a trend for worse OS (14.03&nbsp;months versus 38.6&nbsp;months, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.12), whereas ALDH1 and EGFR copy number alteration did not. Multivariate analysis of the combined data sets was consistent with worse DSS among patients with higher CD44 expression.ConclusionsInstitutional and national TCGA data show the association of elevated baseline CD44 expression with worse STS outcomes. Further study of CD44 as a possible novel STS biomarker appears indicated."

        "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein-1 is a minus-end-directed motor protein that transports cargo over long distances and organizes the intracellular microtubule (MT) network. How dynein motor activity is harnessed for these diverse functions remains unknown. Here, we have uncovered a mechanism for how processive dynein-dynactin complexes drive MT-MT sliding, reorganization, and focusing, activities required for mitotic spindle assembly. We find that motors cooperatively accumulate, in limited numbers, at MT minus-ends. Minus-end accumulations drive MT-MT sliding, independent of MT orientation, resulting in the clustering of MT minus-ends. At a mesoscale level, activated dynein-dynactin drives the formation and coalescence of MT asters. Macroscopically, dynein-dynactin activity leads to bulk contraction of millimeter-scale MT networks, suggesting that minus-end accumulations of motors produce network-scale contractile stresses. Our data provide a model for how localized dynein activity is harnessed by cells to produce contractile stresses within the cytoskeleton, for example, during mitotic spindle assembly."

        "title": "Temperature-dependent activity of kinesins is regulable",
        "abstract": "Cytoskeletal transport in cells is driven by enzymes whose activity shows sensitive, typically Arrhenius, dependence on temperature. Often, the duration and outcome of cargo transport is determined by the relative success of kinesin vs. dynein motors, which can simultaneously bind to individual cargos and move in opposite direction on microtubules. The question of how kinesin and dynein activity remain coupled over the large temperature ranges experienced by some cells is one of clear biological relevance. We report a break in the Arrhenius behavior of both kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 enzymatic activity at 4.7&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C and 10.5&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C, respectively. Further, we report that this transition temperature significantly changes as a function of chemical background: addition of 200&nbsp;mM TMAO increases transition temperatures by \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc6&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C in all cases. Our results show that Arrhenius trend breaks are common to all cytoskeletal motors and open a broad question of how such activity transitions are regulated in&nbsp;vivo. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Many cytoskeletal motors studied to date follow Arrhenius kinetics, at least from room temperature up to mammalian body temperature. However the thermal dynamic range is typically finite, and breaks in Arrhenius trends are commonly observed at biologically relevant temperatures. Here we report that the thermal dynamic range of kinesins is also limited and moreover that the location of the Arrhenius break for kinesins can shift significantly based on chemical backgrounds. This implies that the balance of multiple motor cargo transport along the cytoskeleton is far more tunable as a function of temperature than previously appreciated."

        "abstract": "Meiosis produces haploid gametes by accurately reducing chromosome ploidy through one round of DNA replication and two subsequent rounds of chromosome segregation and cell division. The cell divisions of female meiosis are highly asymmetric and give rise to a large egg and two very small polar bodies that do not contribute to development. These asymmetric divisions are driven by meiotic spindles that are small relative to the size of the egg and have one pole juxtaposed against the cell cortex to promote polar body extrusion. An additional unique feature of female meiosis is that fertilization occurs before extrusion of the second polar body in nearly all animal species. Thus sperm-derived chromosomes are present in the egg during female meiosis. Here, we explore the idea that the asymmetry of female meiosis spatially separates the sperm from the meiotic spindle to prevent detrimental interactions between the spindle and the paternal chromosomes."

        "abstract": "Veronaea botryosa is a melanized mold and cause of systemic fungal infections in cultured sturgeon (Acipenser spp.). Mortality in adult female sturgeon caused by this emergent pathogen results in significant economic losses for the caviar industry. Little is known regarding environmental conditions conducive to V. botryosa infection. This study evaluated the effect of temperature on V. botryosa infectivity and dissemination following intramuscular injection challenge of white sturgeon maintained at 13 or 18&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C for 40&nbsp;days. Daily mortality was recorded and persistence of the fungus in the livers of moribund and surviving fish was investigated using culture and histopathological analysis. Fish maintained at 18&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C developed systemic phaeohyphomycosis and had significantly greater mortality than controls and fish maintained at 13&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C (p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.05). Challenged fish, regardless of temperature, exhibited lesions in multiple organs. However, muscle lesions, angioinvasion, and systemic dissemination were more severe and widespread in fish challenged at the higher temperature. In vitro cytotoxicity of V. botryosa was evaluated in white sturgeon skin (WSSK-1) and epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell lines inoculated at spore:cell ratios of 1:10, 1:1 and 10:1, then incubated 15, 20 and 25&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C. Cytotoxicity, as indicated by quantifying the release of lactate dehydrogenase into culture supernatants, increased with increasing spore dose and incubation temperature in both fish cell lines. Findings suggest that temperature significantly influences the development of systemic V. botryosa infection in white sturgeon and that WSSK-1 and EPC cells are suitable in vitro models for the study of host-pathogen interactions between V. botryosa and fish epithelial cells."

        "abstract": "In the Northern Hemisphere, springtime events are frequently reported as advancing more rapidly at higher latitudes, presumably due to an acceleration of warming with latitude. However, this assumption has not been investigated in an analytical framework that simultaneously examines acceleration of warming with latitude while accounting for variation in phenological time series characteristics that might also co-vary with latitude. We analyzed 743 phenological trend estimates spanning 86 years and 42.6 degrees of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as rates of Northern Hemisphere warming over the same period and latitudinal range. We detected significant patterns of co-variation in phenological time series characteristics that may confound estimates of the magnitude of variation in trends with latitude. Notably, shorter and more recent time series tended to produce the strongest phenological trends, and these also tended to be from higher latitude studies. However, accounting for such variation only slightly modified the relationship between rates of phenological advance and latitude, which was highly significant. Furthermore, warming has increased non-linearly with latitude over the past several decades, most strongly since 1998 and northward of 59\u00c2\u00b0N latitude. The acceleration of warming with latitude has likely contributed to an acceleration of phenological advance along the same gradient."

        "abstract": "Rapid climate warming is altering Arctic and alpine tundra ecosystem structure and function, including shifts in plant phenology. While the advancement of green up and flowering are well-documented, it remains unclear whether all phenophases, particularly those later in the season, will shift in unison or respond divergently to warming. Here, we present the largest synthesis to our knowledge of experimental warming effects on tundra plant phenology from the International Tundra Experiment. We examine the effect of warming on a suite of season-wide plant phenophases. Results challenge the expectation that all phenophases will advance in unison to warming. Instead, we find that experimental warming caused: (1) larger phenological shifts in reproductive versus vegetative phenophases and (2) advanced reproductive phenophases and green up but delayed leaf senescence which translated to a lengthening of the growing season by approximately 3%. Patterns were consistent across sites, plant species and over time. The advancement of reproductive seasons and lengthening of growing seasons may have significant consequences for trophic interactions and ecosystem function across the tundra."

All diets were fed as total mixed ration containing 60% (dry matter [DM] basis) of basal starter feed and 40% (DM basis) of forage, but varied in composition of forage source including i) alfalfa (40% DM, AH); ii) alfalfa hay (26.7% DM)+oat hay (13.3% DM; OH); iii) alfalfa hay (26.7% DM)+corn silage (13.3% DM; WS).ResultsDry matter intake was not different among treatment groups (p>0.05). However, BW (p<0.05) and average daily gain (p<0.05) of calves fed AH and OH were greater than WS-fed calves, whereas heart girth was greater in OH-fed calves than those fed AH and WS (p<0.05). Ruminal fermentation parameters including proportion of butyric acid, acetated-to-propionate ratio, concentration of total volatile fatty acid, protozoal protein, bacterial protein, and microbial protein in rumen were the highest in OH (p<0.05) and the lowest in WS. Compared with the AH and WS, feeding oat hay to postweaning calves increased crude protein digestibility (p<0.05), and decreased duration of diarrhea (p<0.05) and fecal index (p<0.05).ConclusionOur results suggested that partially replacing alfalfa hay with oat hay improved ruminal fermentation, nitrogen utilization, and reduced incidence of diarrhea in post-weaning dairy calves."

Simultaneously, RG-FETs demonstrate a high on/off ratio of 2.76 \u00c3\u2014 107 with superior reproducibility and reliability. With the ultra-steep SS, the RG-FETs can be readily employed to construct logic inverter with an ultra-high gain \u00e2\u2030\u02c62000, indicating exciting potential for future low-power electronics and monolithic integration."

        "abstract": "This prospective, single-centre cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of a portable vision reading device, OrCam Read, on vision-related quality-of-life and independent functional status in patients with low vision due to stroke or brain tumours. Six patients with poor visual acuity or visual field defects due to a stroke or a brain tumour were enrolled at a U.S. Ophthalmology Department. Participants were trained to use OrCam Read and given a loaner device for the 1\u00e2\u20ac\u2030month duration of the study. Various assessments, including daily function tests, the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25, and the 10-item neuro-ophthalmic supplement, were administered at the first and last visits. Patients experience with the device was evaluated with weekly telephone and end-of-study satisfaction surveys. The main outcome measures were the patient satisfaction with OrCam and the mean assessment scores between enrolment and final visits. The intervention with OrCam significantly improved patients ability to complete daily tasks and participants reported good satisfaction with the device. The results also show non-significant improvement with distant activities, dependency, and role difficulties. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of studying vision-related quality-of-life using a portable vision device in this patient population and pave the way for a larger study to validate the results of this study."

        "title": "Developing measures to assess constructs from the Inner Setting domain of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research",
        "abstract": "BackgroundScientists and practitioners alike need reliable, valid measures of contextual factors that influence implementation. Yet, few existing measures demonstrate reliability or validity. To meet this need, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of measures of several constructs within the Inner Setting domain of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).MethodsWe searched the literature for existing measures for the 7 Inner Setting domain constructs (Culture Overall, Culture Stress, Culture Effort, Implementation Climate, Learning Climate, Leadership Engagement, and Available Resources). We adapted items for the healthcare context, pilot-tested the adapted measures in 4 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and implemented the revised measures in 78 FQHCs in the 7 states (N\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030327 respondents) with a focus on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening practices. To psychometrically assess our measures, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis models (CFA; structural validity), assessed inter-item consistency (reliability), computed scale correlations (discriminant validity), and calculated inter-rater reliability and agreement (organization-level construct reliability and validity).ResultsCFAs for most constructs exhibited good model fit (CFI\u00e2\u20ac\u2030>\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.90, TLI\u00e2\u20ac\u2030>\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.90, SRMR\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.08, RMSEA\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.08), with almost all factor loadings exceeding 0.40. Scale reliabilities ranged from good (0.7\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u2030\u00a4\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00ce\u00b1\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.9) to excellent (\u00ce\u00b1\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u2030\u00a5\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.9). Scale correlations fell below 0.90, indicating discriminant validity. Inter-rater reliability and agreement were sufficiently high to justify measuring constructs at the clinic-level.ConclusionsOur findings provide psychometric evidence in support of the CFIR Inner Setting measures. Our findings also suggest the Inner Setting measures from individuals can be aggregated to represent the clinic-level. Measurement of the Inner Setting constructs can be useful in better understanding and predicting implementation in FQHCs and can be used to identify targets of strategies to accelerate and enhance implementation efforts in FQHCs."

        "title": "Scanning Tunneling Microscopy of molecules on metals",
        "abstract": "Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), a relatively new technique capable of observing atom-sized features, has recently made significant inroads into observations of molecules on surfaces. At first thought it might seem that a microscopy which can image atoms should be trivially capable of observing molecules. There are several reasons why this is not the case. First, because the atoms within a molecule are already bonded to one another, molecules are frequently only weakly affixed to surfaces and other molecules, and consequently may be mobile at room temperature. A second difficulty arises because most molecules are electrically insulating. Since STM detects atoms by sensing a small flow of current between an atomically sharp probe and the sample, a perfectly insulating molecule might be expected to be invisible with the STM. Luckily, it is often found that chemical interactions between molecules and a metal surface are sufficiently strong to change the electrical properties enough so that thin layers of insulating molecules are easily detected. Another significant problem involves the possibility that the tunneling tip is brought so close to the conducting support surface that molecules are essentially squeezed out of the vacuum gap and remain undetected. These difficulties have caused a significant delay in the success of applications of STM to high resolution molecular imaging, as opposed to early STM successes with metal and semiconductor surfaces. Our data indicates that each of these problems can be important, and that steps can be taken to reduce or eliminate them. We illustrate the recent success of STM at this new task with the imaging of a few organic molecules on metal surfaces. Our first studies of molecules involved ordered coadsorbed CO and benzene on Rh(111) surfaces. This system shows a 3x3 structure in low energy electron diffraction (LEED) for a 2/1 CO/benzene ratio (1) and a c(2\u00e2\u02c6\u01613 x 4)rect structure for a 1/1 ratio (2). For the 3x3 structure, it was found that benzene was easily imaged while the CO image contrast was substantially smaller (3). In addition to imaging well-ordered terraces, we were able to observe benzene binding near step edges, diffusion (possibly induced by the STM) of benzene at defects, and internal structure within the benzene molecules. The sharpest images possessed only 3-fold symmetry, presumably because 3 of the 6 C-C bonds are above substrate metal atoms. Further reductions in the image symmetry associated with asymmetric tips were frequently observed. Subsequent observations of the c(2 \u00e2\u02c6\u01613 x4)rect structure revealed the three domains present for this structure and frequent domain changes at step edges. For this system we also found small protrusions to occupy the sites assigned to CO in the LEED model (4) so that this molecule can also be imaged. Images of disordered samples were difficult to interpret because of possible diffusion during the image acquisition. In subsequent measurements we studied Cu-phthalocyanine, which is of interest due to the catalytic activities of its central metal atom, on different substrates in order to better understand and exploit the consequences of variations in the molecule-surface interaction. In preliminary work, using submonolayer coverages on Si(111) or Au(111), we were not successful in obtaining good images which showed the 4-fold symmetry of this molecule. On Cu(100), however, atomic resolution images of this molecule were readily obtained for coverages up to 1 monolayer (5). At low coverages the molecules occupy two binding sites related by a mirror plane and show little tendency to form islands, although there may be some local orientational order. Molecules near step edges appeared to overlap the steps, with two lobes on the upper terrace and two lobes on the lower terrace. It was possible to adjust the operating conditions so that tip-molecule interactions appear to induce translational motion of the molecules. The lattice of the Cu(100) substrate was also observed but the molecules appear less stable, or simply absent, under conditions where the metal corrugation is large. Packed ordered arrays of molecules were observed near 1 monolayer coverage with domain structures in agreement with earlier LEED observations (6). When the coverage was increased slightly above 1 monolayer we found that we were unable to attain high resolution images of second layer molecules. At coverages slightly above 1 monolayer, we observed protrusions above a packed, ordered first layer, which appear diffuse and unstable. The diffuse character of the second layer molecule images strongly resembles that of images of sub-monolayers on Au(111) and Si(111). We suspect that the poor resolution results from inadequate binding of the molecules to the underlying layer. This does not imply that the molecules are too poorly conductive to be imaged, because the apparent height of second layer molecules is quite similar to that of first layer molecules. But they may be moved about by thermal effects or tip-molecule interactions. Although it is still in its infancy, these results suggest that STM will become increasingly important for studies of surface chemistry. Improvements in the apparatus aimed at increasing the image acquisition rate, allowing operation at different temperatures, and employing more elaborate sample and tip preparation techniques should extend the impact of this technique to a broader range of systems. A better understanding of the origin of the image contrast is certain to result both from empirical results and more quantitative theoretical analyses. Recent work will hopefully illustrate these points. It is our hope and expectation that STM images of reactive molecules will help to provide insight into the atomic scale details of surface mediated chemical processes."

        "abstract": "Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulate target gene expression and can be used as tools for understanding biological processes and identifying new therapeutic targets. Currently, ncRNA molecules for research and therapeutic use are limited to ncRNA mimics made by chemical synthesis. We have recently established a high-yield and cost-effective method of producing bioengineered or biologic ncRNA agents (BERAs) through bacterial fermentation, which is based on a stable tRNA/pre-miR-34a carrier (~\u00e2\u20ac\u2030180&nbsp;nt) that accommodates target small RNAs. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to heterogeneously express longer ncRNAs (e.g., >\u00e2\u20ac\u2030260&nbsp;nt), and it is unknown if single BERA may carry multiple small RNAs. To address this issue, we hypothesized that an additional human pre-miR-34a could be attached to the tRNA/pre-miR-34a scaffold to offer a new tRNA/pre-miR-34a/pre-miR-34a carrier (~\u00e2\u20ac\u2030296&nbsp;nt) for the accommodation of multiple small RNAs. We thus designed ten different combinatorial BERAs (CO-BERAs) that include different combinations of miRNAs, siRNAs, and antagomirs. Our data showed that all target CO-BERAs were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli at high levels, greater than 40% in total bacterial RNAs. Furthermore, recombinant CO-BERAs were purified to a high degree of homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography methods. In addition, CO-BERAs exhibited strong anti-proliferative activities against a variety of human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. These results support the production of long ncRNA molecules carrying different warhead small RNAs for multi-targeting which may open avenues for developing new biologic RNAs as experimental, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools."

The longitudinal trajectory of these impairments, however, remains unclear. Indeed, some studies have observed degeneration and others stability or even improvement over time in these illnesses. Here we examined the longitudinal stability of the AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT), a cognitive control task, in 52 patients with recent-onset SZ (<2 years from first study measurement), 20 patients with recent-onset BD Type I with psychotic features, and 70 healthy control subjects. Subjects performed the AX-CPT at 2 time points separated by an average of 365 days (range 270-620). Previously identified deficits in cognitive control were replicated in both patient groups. No effects of time or interactions between time and diagnosis were observed. Intraclass correlation coefficients also suggested AX-CPT performance was stable across time for all diagnostic groups. Although performance was stable on average, a positive association was noted between change in cognitive control and change in disorganization symptom severity across patient groups. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that deficits in cognitive control are present in both disorders and stable over the early course of psychotic illness. No evidence was observed for progression or deterioration of cognitive control or differential recovery in SZ compared to BD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)."

However, current approved clinical implantable vascular devices generally have high failure rates primarily due to their surface lacking inherent functional endothelium. Here, inspired by the pathological mechanisms of vascular device failure and physiological functions of native endothelium, we developed a new generation of bioactive parylene (poly(p-xylylene))-based conformal coating to address these challenges of the vascular devices. This coating used a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to introduce an endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) specific binding ligand LXW7 (cGRGDdvc) onto the vascular devices for preventing platelet adhesion and selectively capturing endogenous EPCs. Also, we confirmed the long-term stability and function of this coating in human serum. Using two vascular disease-related large animal models, a porcine carotid artery interposition model and a porcine carotid artery-jugular vein arteriovenous graft model, we demonstrated that this coating enabled rapid generation of self-renewable \"living\" endothelium on the blood contacting surface of the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts after implantation. We expect this easy-to-apply conformal coating will present a promising avenue to engineer surface properties of \"off-the-shelf\" implantable vascular devices for long-lasting performance in the clinical settings."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Diabetic ketoacidosis in children may cause brain injuries ranging from mild to severe. Whether intravenous fluids contribute to these injuries has been debated for decades. METHODS:We conducted a 13-center, randomized, controlled trial that examined the effects of the rate of administration and the sodium chloride content of intravenous fluids on neurologic outcomes in children with diabetic ketoacidosis. Children were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups in a 2-by-2 factorial design (0.9% or 0.45% sodium chloride content and rapid or slow rate of administration). The primary outcome was a decline in mental status (two consecutive Glasgow Coma Scale scores of <14, on a scale ranging from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating worse mental status) during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. Secondary outcomes included clinically apparent brain injury during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis, short-term memory during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis, and memory and IQ 2 to 6 months after recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis. RESULTS:A total of 1389 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis were reported in 1255 children. The Glasgow Coma Scale score declined to less than 14 in 48 episodes (3.5%), and clinically apparent brain injury occurred in 12 episodes (0.9%). No significant differences among the treatment groups were observed with respect to the percentage of episodes in which the Glasgow Coma Scale score declined to below 14, the magnitude of decline in the Glasgow Coma Scale score, or the duration of time in which the Glasgow Coma Scale score was less than 14; with respect to the results of the tests of short-term memory; or with respect to the incidence of clinically apparent brain injury during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. Memory and IQ scores obtained after the children's recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis also did not differ significantly among the groups. Serious adverse events other than altered mental status were rare and occurred with similar frequency in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS:Neither the rate of administration nor the sodium chloride content of intravenous fluids significantly influenced neurologic outcomes in children with diabetic ketoacidosis.

These infection modes are little studied, and yet they appear to be more abundant and ubiquitous in nature than previously recognized, and can play a significant role in the ecology and evolution of their bacterial hosts. In this review, we discuss the extent, causes and consequences of alternative phage lifestyles, and clarify conceptual and terminological confusion to facilitate research progress. We propose distinct definitions for the terms 'pseudolysogeny' and 'productive or non-productive chronic infection', and distinguish them from the carrier state life cycle, which describes a population-level phenomenon. Our review also finds that phages may change their infection modes in response to environmental conditions or the physiological state of the host cell. We outline known molecular mechanisms underlying the alternative phage-host interactions, including specific genetic pathways and their considerable biotechnological potential. Moreover, we discuss potential implications of the alternative phage lifestyles for microbial biology and ecosystem functioning, as well as applied topics such as phage therapy."

We have found an unexplored mechanism, by which basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) induces expression of fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) to increase core fucosylations of N-linked glycans of membrane-associated proteins, including several integrin subunits. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments show that FUT8 is both necessary and sufficient to induce migration of MSCs. Silencing FUT8 also affects migration of MSCs in zebrafish embryos and a murine bone fracture model. Finally, we use in silico modeling to show that core fucosylations restrict the degrees of freedom of glycans on the integrin's surface, hence stabilizing glycans on a specific position. Altogether, we show a mechanism whereby FGF2 promotes migration of MSCs by modifying N-glycans. This work may help improve delivery of MSCs in therapeutic settings."

The results showed that both meaning and image salience predicted the duration-weighted distribution of attention, but that when the correlation between meaning and salience was statistically controlled, meaning accounted for unique variance in attention whereas salience did not. This pattern was observed in early as well as late fixations, fixations including and excluding the centers of the scenes, and fixations following short as well as long saccades. The results strongly suggest that meaning guides attention in real-world scenes. We discuss the results from the perspective of a cognitive-relevance theory of attentional guidance."

        "abstract": "The next generation of 6 to 10 m class telescopes is being planned to include the capability for adaptive wavefront correction. The Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) with its 7 m baseline, provides an ideal testbed for novel techniques of adaptive optics. Using a new instrument based on a six segment adaptive mirror, a number of wavefront sensing algorithms including an artificial neural network have been implemented to demonstrate the high resolution imaging capability of the telescope. These algorithms rely on a freely available property of starlight, namely its coherence over large scales, to sense directly atmospheric and instrumental phase errors across large distances. In this paper, we report results obtained so far with resolutions between 0.08 and 0.3 arcseconds at 2.2 \u00ce\u00bcm wavelength. We also show data indicating that at the level of 0.1 arcsec imaging in good seeing, the isoplanatic patch at this wavelength is at least 20 arcsec across."

        "abstract": "The investigation of merging galaxy clusters that exhibit radio relics is strengthening our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters, the nature of dark matter, the intracluster medium, and astrophysical particle acceleration. Each merging cluster provides only a single view of the cluster formation process, and the variety of merging clusters is vast. Clusters hosting double radio relics are rare and extremely important because they allow tight constraints on the merger scenario. We present a weak-lensing and X-ray analysis of MACS J1752.0+4440 (z = 0.365) and ZWCL 1856.8+6616 (z = 0.304), two double radio relic clusters. Our weak-lensing mass estimates show that each cluster is a major merger with approximately 1:1 mass ratio. The total mass of MACS J1752.0+4440 (ZWCL 1856.8+6616) is M200 = 14.7-+3.33.8 \u00c2\u00b4 1014 Me (M200 = 2.4-+0.70.9 \u00c2\u00b4 1014 Me). We find that these two clusters have comparable features in their weak-lensing and gas distributions, even though the systems have vastly different total masses. From the likeness of the X-ray morphologies and the remarkable symmetry of the radio relics, we propose that both systems underwent nearly head-on collisions. However, revelations from the hot-gas features and our multiwavelength data analysis suggest that ZWCL 1856.8+6618 is likely at a later merger phase than MACS J1752.0+4440. We postulate that the SW radio relic in MACS J1752.0 +4440 is a result of particle reacceleration."

The effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on Lp(a) levels in relation to apo(a) size polymorphism remain unclear. ART effects on allele-specific apo(a) level (ASL), an Lp(a) level associated with individual apo(a) alleles within each allele-pair, were determined in 126 HIV-seropositive women. ART effects were tested by a mixed-effects model across pre-ART and post-ART first and third visits. Data from 120 HIV-seronegative women were used. The mean age was 38 years; most were African-American (\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc70%). Pre-ART ASLs associated with the larger (4.6 mg/dl vs. 8.0 mg/dl, P = 0.024) or smaller (13 mg/dl vs. 19 mg/dl, P = 0.041) apo(a) sizes were lower in the HIV-seropositive versus HIV-seronegative group, as was the prevalence of a high Lp(a) level (P = 0.013). Post-ART ASL and prevalence of high Lp(a) or apo(a) sizes and frequency of small size apo(a) (\u00ee\u20ac\u00a322 kringles) did not differ between the two groups. ART increased Lp(a) level (from 18 to 24 mg/dl, P < 0.0001) and both ASLs (P < 0.001). In conclusion, regardless of genetic control, Lp(a) can be modulated by HIV and its treatment. ART initiation abrogates HIV-induced suppression of Lp(a) levels and ASLs, contributing to promote CVD risk in HIV-seropositive individuals."

        "abstract": "Recently it has become feasible to detect long blocks of nearly identical sequence shared between pairs of genomes. These identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events and, as such, contain ample signal to infer recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of IBD blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. We introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite-likelihood approach to fit these formulas. We then extensively evaluate our theory and inference method on a range of scenarios using simulated data. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match the simulated block-sharing patterns. We then demonstrate that our inference scheme can accurately and robustly infer dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the Population Reference Sample data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of [Formula: see text] during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with increasing pairwise sample distance."

        "abstract": "Natural selection at one site shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Quantifying the effects of \"linked selection\" on levels of genetic diversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection and selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples using composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger effect in reducing diversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than previously appreciated."

In settings where the dimension of the observations is comparable to the sample size, upward bias in sample eigenvalues and inconsistency of sample eigenvectors are among the most notable phenomena that appear. These phenomena, and the limiting behavior of the rescaled extreme sample eigenvalues, have recently been investigated in detail under the spiked covariance model. The behavior of the bulk of the sample eigenvalues under weak distributional assumptions on the observations has been described. These results have been exploited to develop new estimation and hypothesis testing methods for the population covariance matrix. Furthermore, partly in response to these phenomena, alternative classes of estimation procedures have been developed by exploiting sparsity of the eigenvectors or the covariance matrix. This paper gives an orientation to these areas."

We evaluated changes in muscle activity of thirty-seven individuals with chronic stroke (>\u00e2\u20ac\u20306&nbsp;months), in response to a single session of LT at their self-selected or fastest-comfortable speed (FS) with three levels of BWS (0%, 15%, and 30%), and at FS with 30% BWS and seven different combinations of therapist assistance at the paretic foot, non-paretic foot, and trunk. Altered Muscle Activation Pattern (AMAP), a previously developed tool in our lab was used to evaluate the effects of LT parameter variation on eight lower-extremity muscle patterns in individuals with stroke. Repeated-measures mixed-model ANOVA was used to determine the effects of speed, BWS, and their interaction on AMAP scores. The Wilcoxon-signed rank test was used to determine the effects of therapist-assisted conditions on AMAP scores. Increased BWS mostly improved lower-extremity muscle activity patterns, but increased speed resulted in worse plantar flexor activity. Abnormal early plantar flexor activity during stance decreased with assistance at trunk and both feet, exaggerated plantar flexor activity during late swing decreased with assistance to the non-paretic foot or trunk, and diminished gluteus medius activity during stance increased with assistance to paretic foot and/or trunk. Therefore, different sets of training parameters have different immediate effects on activation patterns of each muscle and gait subphases."

A fundamental limitation of previous studies examining the obligate role for HIF-\u00ce\u00b1 isoforms in the skeleton involves the persistence of gene deletion as osteolineage cells differentiate into osteocytes. Because osteocytes orchestrate skeletal development and homeostasis, we evaluated the influence of Vhl or Hif1a disruption in osteocytes. Osteocytic Vhl deletion caused HBM phenotype, but Hif1a was dispensable in osteocytes. Vhl cKO mice revealed enhanced canonical Wnt signaling. B cell development was reduced while myelopoiesis increased in osteocytic Vhl cKO, revealing a novel influence of Vhl/HIF-\u00ce\u00b1 function in osteocytes on maintenance of bone microarchitecture via canonical Wnt signaling and effects on hematopoiesis."

Accumulating evidence attests to the important roles of the immune system in OA pathogenesis. Understanding the role of various immune cells in joint degeneration or joint repair after injury is vital for improving therapeutic strategies for treating OA. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) develops in ~50% of individuals who have experienced an articular trauma like an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Here, using the high resolution of single-cell RNA sequencing, we delineated the temporal dynamics of immune cell accumulation in the mouse knee joint after ACL rupture. Our study identified multiple immune cell types in the joint including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, B cells, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. Monocytes and macrophage populations showed the most dramatic changes after injury. Further characterization of monocytes and macrophages reveled 9 major subtypes with unique transcriptomics signatures, including a tissue resident Lyve1hiFolr2hi macrophage population and Trem2hiFcrls+ recruited macrophages, both showing enrichment for phagocytic genes and growth factors such as Igf1, Pdgfa and Pdgfc. We also identified several genes induced or repressed after ACL injury in a cell type-specific manner. This study provides new insight into PTOA-associated changes in the immune microenvironment and highlights macrophage subtypes that may play a role in joint repair after injury."

When applied to a variety of macaque and human motor cortical datasets, latent factor analysis via dynamical systems accurately predicts observed behavioral variables, extracts precise firing rate estimates of neural dynamics on single trials, infers perturbations to those dynamics that correlate with behavioral choices, and combines data from non-overlapping recording sessions spanning months to improve inference of underlying dynamics."

        "abstract": "Currently, it is not well understood how ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modify inflammatory responses triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists in human dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we show that AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the tryptophan derivatives 6-formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ), kynurenine (kyn), and the natural dietary compound indole-3-carbinol (I3C) differentially modify cytokine expression in human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs). The results show that TLR-activated MoDCs express higher levels of AhR and are more sensitive toward the effects of AhR ligands. Depending on the cytokine, treatment with AhR ligands led to a synergistic or antagonistic effect of the TLR-triggered response in MoDCs. Thus, activation of AhR increased the expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u00ce\u00b2, but decreased the expression of IL-12A in TLR-activated MoDCs. Furthermore, TCDD and FICZ may have opposite effects on the expression of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) in TLR8-activated MoDCs indicating that the effect of the specific AhR ligand may depend on the presence of the specific TLR agonist. Gene silencing showed that synergistic effects of AhR ligands on TLR-induced expression of IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 require a functional AhR and the expression of NF-\u00ce\u00baB RelB. On the other hand, repression of IL-12A by TCDD and FICZ involved the induction of the caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) transcription factor. Additionally, the levels of DC surface markers were decreased in MoDCs by TCDD, FICZ and I3C, but not by kyn. Overall, these data demonstrate that AhR modulates TLR-induced expression of cytokines and DC-specific surface markers in MoDCs involving NF\u00ce\u00baB RelB and the immune regulatory factor CDX2."

We named these \"virgin\" beta cells as they do not stem from existing mature beta cells. Virgin beta cells are found exclusively at the islet periphery in areas that we therefore designated as the \"neogenic niche.\" As beta cells are our only source of insulin, their loss leads to diabetes. Islets also contain glucagon-producing alpha cells and somatostatin-producing delta cells, that are important for glucose homeostasis and form a mantle surrounding the beta cell core. This 3D architecture is important and determines access to blood flow and innervation. We propose that the distinctive islet architecture may also play an important, but hitherto unappreciated role in generation of new endocrine cells, including beta cells. We discuss several predictions to further test the contribution of the neogenic niche to beta cell regeneration."

        "abstract": "This study examines the uncertainty associated with two commonly used GIS-based groundwater vulnerability models, DRASTIC and EPIK, in assessing seawater intrusion, a growing threat along coastal urban areas due to overexploitation of groundwater resources. For this purpose, concentrations of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in groundwater samples at three pilot areas along the Eastern Mediterranean were compared with mapped vulnerability predictions obtained through DRASTIC and EPIK. While field measurements demonstrated high levels of groundwater salinity depending on the density of urbanization, both vulnerability assessment methods exhibited a limited ability in capturing saltwater intrusion dynamics. In the three pilot areas, DRASTIC was only able to predict correctly between 8.3 and 55.6% of the salinity-based water quality ranges, while EPIK's predictions ranged between 11.7 and 77.8%. This emphasizing that conventional vulnerability models perform poorly when anthropogenic impacts induce lateral flow processes such as seawater intrusion caused primarily by vertical groundwater extraction."

        "abstract": "Accurate soil characterization is crucial for understanding soil-water interactions and allowing for better on-farm agricultural and environmental management. Current soil characterization methods lack quantitative attributes that integrate the soil mapping units with environmental and agronomical models. In this research we proposed a methodology to physically characterize the soil water medium using quantitative parameters. We incorporated the continuously measured soil water potential curve and the soil shrinkage curve to extract the physically based pedostructural (PS) parameters needed for characterizing the soil water medium. We present a methodology to generate and define functional soil mapping units that possess physical and quantitative parameters. We followed a four step general system hierarchical approach overlaying study area map, landform map, and SSURGO map. The fourth step was to validate the generated functional soil units using discriminate analysis performed on the PS parameters extracted for every soil mapping unit. Results of this study show that surface horizon (Ap) have higher PS parameter values than subsurface horizon Bt. The PS concept showed high capabilities in defining the soil mapping units, as concluded from the discriminate analysis that was performed."

        "abstract": "The nucleus is physically linked to the cytoskeleton, adhesions, and extracellular matrix-all of which sustain forces, but their relationships to DNA damage are obscure. We show that nuclear rupture with cytoplasmic mislocalization of multiple DNA repair factors correlates with high nuclear curvature imposed by an external probe or by cell attachment to either aligned collagen fibers or stiff matrix. Mislocalization is greatly enhanced by lamin A depletion, requires hours for nuclear reentry, and correlates with an increase in pan-nucleoplasmic foci of the DNA damage marker \u00ce\u00b3H2AX. Excess DNA damage is rescued in ruptured nuclei by cooverexpression of multiple DNA repair factors as well as by soft matrix or inhibition of actomyosin tension. Increased contractility has the opposite effect, and stiff tumors with low lamin A indeed exhibit increased nuclear curvature, more frequent nuclear rupture, and excess DNA damage. Additional stresses likely play a role, but the data suggest high curvature promotes nuclear rupture, which compromises retention of DNA repair factors and favors sustained damage."

        "abstract": "Marrow-derived macrophages are highly phagocytic, but whether they can also traffic into solid tumors and engulf cancer cells is questionable, given the well-known limitations of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here, SIRP\u00ce\u00b1 on macrophages from mouse and human marrow was inhibited to block recognition of its ligand, the \"marker of self\" CD47 on all other cells. These macrophages were then systemically injected into mice with fluorescent human tumors that had been antibody targeted. Within days, the tumors regressed, and single-cell fluorescence analyses showed that the more the macrophages engulfed, the more they accumulated within regressing tumors. Human-marrow-derived macrophages engorged on the human tumors, while TAMs were minimally phagocytic, even toward CD47-knockdown tumors. Past studies had opsonized tumors in&nbsp;situ with antibody and/or relied on&nbsp;mouse TAMs but had not injected SIRP\u00ce\u00b1-inhibited cells; also, unlike past injections of anti-CD47, blood parameters remained normal and safe. Consistent with&nbsp;tumor-selective engorge-and-accumulate processes in&nbsp;vivo, phagocytosis in&nbsp;vitro inhibited macrophage migration through micropores that mimic features of dense 3D tissue. Accumulation of SIRP\u00ce\u00b1-inhibited macrophages in tumors favored tumor regression for 1-2&nbsp;weeks, but donor macrophages quickly differentiated toward non-phagocytic, high-SIRP\u00ce\u00b1 TAMs. Analyses of macrophages on soft (like marrow) or stiff (like solid tumors) collagenous gels demonstrated a stiffness-driven, retinoic-acid-modulated upregulation of SIRP\u00ce\u00b1 and the mechanosensitive nuclear marker lamin-A. Mechanosensitive differentiation was similarly evident in&nbsp;vivo and likely limited the anti-tumor effects, as confirmed by re-initiation of tumor regression by fresh injections of SIRP\u00ce\u00b1-inhibited macrophages. Macrophage motility, phagocytosis, and differentiation in&nbsp;vivo are thus coupled."

        "abstract": "Age- and menopause-related deficits in working memory can be partially restored with estradiol replacement in women and female nonhuman primates. Working memory is a cognitive function reliant on persistent firing of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) neurons that requires the activation of GluN2B-containing glutamate NMDA receptors. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of phospho-Tyr1472-GluN2B (pGluN2B), a predominant form of GluN2B seen at the synapse, is sensitive to aging or estradiol treatment and coupled to working memory performance. First, ovariectomized young and aged rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) received long-term cyclic vehicle (V) or estradiol (E) treatment and were tested on the delayed response (DR) test of working memory. Then, serial section electron microscopic immunocytochemistry was performed to quantitatively assess the subcellular distribution of pGluN2B. While the densities of pGluN2B immunogold particles in dlPFC dendritic spines were not different across age or treatment groups, the percentage of gold particles located within the synaptic compartment was significantly lower in aged-E monkeys compared to young-E and aged-V monkeys. On the other hand, the percentage of pGluN2B gold particles in the spine cytoplasm was decreased with E treatment in young, but increased with E in aged monkeys. In aged monkeys, DR average accuracy inversely correlated with the percentage of synaptic pGluN2B, while it positively correlated with the percentage of cytoplasmic pGluN2B. Together, E replacement may promote cognitive health in aged monkeys, in part, by decreasing the relative representation of synaptic pGluN2B and potentially protecting the dlPFC from calcium toxicity."

There are no studies evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of varying doses of CoQ10 in chronic hemodialysis patients, a population subject to increased oxidative stress.MethodsWe performed a dose escalation study to test the hypothesis that CoQ10 therapy is safe, well-tolerated, and improves biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients receiving hemodialysis therapy. Plasma concentrations of F2-isoprostanes and isofurans were measured to assess systemic oxidative stress and plasma CoQ10 concentrations were measured to determine dose, concentration and response relationships.ResultsFifteen of the 20 subjects completed the entire dose escalation sequence. Mean CoQ10 levels increased in a linear fashion from 704 \u00c2\u00b1 286 ng/mL at baseline to 4033 \u00c2\u00b1 1637 ng/mL, and plasma isofuran concentrations decreased from 141 \u00c2\u00b1 67.5 pg/mL at baseline to 72.2 \u00c2\u00b1 37.5 pg/mL at the completion of the study (P = 0.003 vs. baseline and P < 0.001 for the effect of dose escalation on isofurans). Plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations did not change during the study.ConclusionsCoQ10 supplementation at doses as high as 1800 mg per day was safe in all subjects and well-tolerated in most. Short-term daily CoQ10 supplementation decreased plasma isofuran concentrations in a dose dependent manner. CoQ10 supplementation may improve mitochondrial function and decrease oxidative stress in patients receiving hemodialysis.Trial registrationThis clinical trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov [NCT00908297] on May 21, 2009."

Physical examination revealed a large subcutaneous mass on the left metatarsus and a fine needle aspirate revealed suspected neoplastic spindle cells. Hematologic evaluation was unremarkable and a computed tomography scan revealed invasion of the mass into skeletal muscles but showed no evidence of metastatic disease. An amputation was performed, after which the patient recovered uneventfully. However, the rabbit was found suddenly dead at time of discharge from unknown cause. Gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical evaluation was performed, which diagnosed a peripheral nerve sheath tumor. To the authors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge, this is the first detailed case report of a lagomorph peripheral nerve sheath tumor specifically confirmed with immunohistochemistry. Wide surgical excision is considered the treatment of choice and may be combined with radiation therapy. Further research is required to determine risk factors, the role of adjunctive therapy, as well as long-term prognoses for peripheral nerve sheath tumors in rabbits."

EquCab2, a reference genome for the domestic horse, was released in 2007. Although of equal or better quality compared to other first-generation Sanger assemblies, it had many of the shortcomings common to them. In 2014, the equine genomics research community began a project to improve the reference sequence for the horse, building upon the solid foundation of EquCab2 and incorporating new short-read data, long-read data, and proximity ligation data. Here, we present EquCab3. The count of non-N bases in the incorporated chromosomes is improved from 2.33\u00e2\u20ac\u2030Gb in EquCab2 to 2.41\u00e2\u20ac\u2030Gb in EquCab3. Contiguity has also been improved nearly 40-fold with a contig N50 of 4.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2030Mb and scaffold contiguity enhanced to where all but one of the 32 chromosomes is comprised of a single scaffold."

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Molecular breeding of pepper (Capsicum spp.) can be accelerated by developing DNA markers associated with transcriptomes in breeding germplasm. Before the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the majority of sequencing data were generated by the Sanger sequencing method. By leveraging Sanger EST data, we have generated a wealth of genetic information for pepper including thousands of SNPs and Single Position Polymorphic (SPP) markers. To complement and enhance these resources, we applied NGS to three pepper genotypes: Maor, Early Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o and Criollo de Morelos-334 (CM334) to identify SNPs and SSRs in the assembly of these three genotypes. Results Two pepper transcriptome assemblies were developed with different purposes. The first reference sequence, assembled by CAP3 software, comprises 31,196 contigs from >125,000 Sanger-EST sequences that were mainly derived from a Korean F1-hybrid line, Bukang. Overlapping probes were designed for 30,815 unigenes to construct a pepper Affymetrix GeneChip\u00c2\u00ae microarray for whole genome analyses. In addition, custom Python scripts were used to identify 4,236 SNPs in contigs of the assembly. A total of 2,489 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified from the assembly, and primers were designed for the SSRs. Annotation of contigs using Blast2GO software resulted in information for 60% of the unigenes in the assembly. The second transcriptome assembly was constructed from more than 200 million Illumina Genome Analyzer II reads (80\u00e2\u20ac\u201c120 nt) using a combination of Velvet, CLC workbench and CAP3 software packages. BWA, SAMtools and in-house Perl scripts were used to identify SNPs among three pepper genotypes. The SNPs were filtered to be at least 50 bp from any intron-exon junctions as well as flanking SNPs. More than 22,000 high-quality putative SNPs were identified. Using the MISA software, 10,398 SSR markers were also identified within the Illumina transcriptome assembly and primers were designed for the identified markers. The assembly was annotated by Blast2GO and 14,740 (12%) of annotated contigs were associated with functional proteins. Conclusions Before availability of pepper genome sequence, assembling transcriptomes of this economically important crop was required to generate thousands of high-quality molecular markers that could be used in breeding programs. In order to have a better understanding of the assembled sequences and to identify candidate genes underlying QTLs, we annotated the contigs of Sanger-EST and Illumina transcriptome assemblies. These and other information have been curated in a database that we have dedicated for pepper project."

We prove that, for an arbitrary number of parties, our procedure identifies a finite set of entropic information quantities that we conveniently represent geometrically in the form of an arrangement of hyperplanes. This leads us to define the holographic entropy arrangement, whose algebraic and combinatorial aspects we explore in detail. Using the framework, we derive three new information quantities for four parties, as well as a new infinite family for any number of parties. A natural construct from the arrangement is the holographic entropy polyhedron which captures holographic entropy inequalities describing the physically allowed region of entropy space. We illustrate how to obtain the polyhedron by winnowing down the arrangement through a sieve to pick out candidate sign-definite information quantities. Comparing the polyhedron with the holographic entropy cone, we find perfect agreement for 4 parties and corroborating evidence for the conjectured 5-party entropy cone. We work with explicit configurations in arbitrary (time-dependent) states leading to both simple derivations and an intuitive picture of the entanglement&nbsp;pattern."

Following\r\nthe holographic strategy outlined in arXiv:2012.03999 we construct an open\r\neffective field theory for the low-lying modes of the conserved currents. The\r\ncharged plasma is modeled holographically in terms of a Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS\r\nblack hole. We analyze graviton and photon fluctuations about this background,\r\ndecoupling in the process the long-lived momentum diffusion mode from the\r\nshort-lived charged transport mode. Furthermore, as in the aforementioned\r\nreference, we argue that the dynamics of these modes are captured by a set of\r\ndesigner scalars in the background geometry. These scalars have their\r\ngravitational coupling modulated by an auxiliary dilaton with long-lived modes\r\nbeing weakly coupled near the spacetime asymptopia. Aided by these\r\nobservations, we obtain the quadratic effective action that governs the\r\nfluctuating hydrodynamics of charge current and stress tensor, reproducing in\r\nthe process transport data computed previously.

We aimed to assess whether perioperative dexmedetomidine use is associated with improved survival after cardiac surgery.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included 2068 patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery. Among them, 1029 patients received dexmedetomidine, and 1039 patients did not. Intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion of 0.007 \u00ce\u00bcg kg-1 min-1 was initiated before or immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass and lasted for < 24 h. The primary outcome was 5-year survival after cardiac surgery. The propensity scores matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and overlap weighting approaches were used to minimise bias. Survival analyses were performed with Cox proportional-hazard models.ResultsThe median age was 63 yr old and the male to female ratio was 71:29 in both groups. Baseline covariates were balanced between groups after adjustment using PSM, IPTW, or overlap weighting. Patients receiving dexmedetomidine in cardiac surgical procedures had higher survival during postoperative 5 yr in unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio [HR]=0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78; P<0.001), and after adjustment with PSM (HR=0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.89; P=0.009), IPTW (HR=0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.95; P=0.023), or overlap weighting (HR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.89; P=0.006). The 5-yr mortality rate after cardiac surgery was 13% and 20% in the dexmedetomidine and non-dexmedetomidine groups, respectively (PSM adjusted odds ratio=0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.89; P=0.010).ConclusionPerioperative dexmedetomidine infusion was associated with improved 5-yr survival in patients undergoing cardiac surgery."

The tool was developed based on the MDAnalysis package, which is used to import a Molecular Dynamics trajectory. The tool then removes solvent molecules and outputs a new structure file to be used for further simulation and analysis. This process is designed to be iterated by using the resulting dynamic simulation trajectory as the input file. The evaporation is designed to randomly delete solvent molecules while preserving solvation shells around solutes. The evaporation rate can be controlled by the length of the MD simulations and the number of particles removed between dynamic simulations. Validity of the tool was tested extensively using the Gromacs suite. Advantages of this tool include its genericness, simplicity and user friendliness, as no significant modification of existing software platform or Gromacs specific tools are needed.

We genotyped DNA from 30 of 44 tissue blocks and 9 whole blood samples on the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip; DNA quality was insufficient in 14 of 44 samples from tissue blocks. There was significant correlation between the 260/280 ratio and single-nucleotide variation (SNV) call rate (p = 0.0276; r2 = 0.162); 23 of 30 samples from FFPE were genotyped with >\u00e2\u20ac\u203065% call rates.

The eye is patterned along multiple axes, precisely controlled by genetic programs, to delineate neural retina, pigment epithelium, and optic stalk tissues. Pax genes encode developmental regulators of key morphogenetic events, with Pax2 being essential for interpreting inductive signals, including in the eye. PAX2 mutations cause ocular coloboma, when the ventral optic fissure fails to close. Previous studies established that Pax2 is necessary for fissure closure and to maintain the neural retina -- glial optic stalk boundary. Using a Pax2GFP/+ knock-in allele we discovered that the mutant optic nerve head (ONH) lacks molecular boundaries with the retina and RPE, rendering the ONH larger than normal. This was preceded by ventronasal cup mispatterning, a burst of overproliferation and followed by optic cup apoptosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that ONH cells are tripotential, requiring Pax2 to remain committed to glial fates. This work extends current models of ocular development, contributes to broader understanding of tissue boundary formation and informs the underlying mechanisms of human coloboma."

        "title": "Maximizing efficiency of rumen microbial protein production",
        "abstract": "Rumen microbes produce cellular protein inefficiently partly because they do not direct all ATP toward growth. They direct some ATP toward maintenance functions, as long-recognized, but they also direct ATP toward reserve carbohydrate synthesis and energy spilling (futile cycles that dissipate heat). Rumen microbes expend ATP by vacillating between (1) accumulation of reserve carbohydrate after feeding (during carbohydrate excess) and (2) mobilization of that carbohydrate thereafter (during carbohydrate limitation). Protozoa account for most accumulation of reserve carbohydrate, and in competition experiments, protozoa accumulated nearly 35-fold more reserve carbohydrate than bacteria. Some pure cultures of bacteria spill energy, but only recently have mixed rumen communities been recognized as capable of the same. When these communities were dosed glucose in vitro, energy spilling could account for nearly 40% of heat production. We suspect that cycling of glycogen (a major reserve carbohydrate) is a major mechanism of spilling; such cycling has already been observed in single-species cultures of protozoa and bacteria. Interconversions of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) may also expend ATP and depress efficiency of microbial protein production. These interconversions may involve extensive cycling of intermediates, such as cycling of acetate during butyrate production in certain butyrivibrios. We speculate this cycling may expend ATP directly or indirectly. By further quantifying the impact of reserve carbohydrate accumulation, energy spilling, and SCFA interconversions on growth efficiency, we can improve prediction of microbial protein production and guide efforts to improve efficiency of microbial protein production in the rumen."

        "abstract": "Propionate is a microbial metabolite formed in the gastrointestinal tract, and it affects host physiology as a source of energy and signaling molecule. Despite the importance of propionate, the biochemical pathways responsible for its formation are not clear in all microbes. For the succinate pathway used during fermentation, a key enzyme appears to be missing-one that oxidizes ferredoxin and reduces NAD. Here we show that Rnf [ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (Na+-transporting)] is this key enzyme in two abundant bacteria of the rumen (Prevotella brevis and Prevotella ruminicola). We found these bacteria form propionate, succinate, and acetate with the classic succinate pathway. Without ferredoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase, redox cofactors would be unbalanced; it would produce almost equal excess amounts of reduced ferredoxin and oxidized NAD. By combining growth experiments, genomics, proteomics, and enzyme assays, we point to the possibility that these bacteria solve this problem by oxidizing ferredoxin and reducing NAD with Rnf [ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (Na+-transporting)]. Genomic and phenotypic data suggest many bacteria may use Rnf similarly. This work shows the ferredoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity of Rnf is important to propionate formation in Prevotella species and other bacteria from the environment, and it provides fundamental knowledge for manipulating fermentative propionate production."

These molecules are formed during fermentation by microbes in the rumen, but even after decades of study, the biochemical pathways responsible for forming them are not always clear. Here we review recent advances in this area and their importance for improving animal productivity. Studies of bacterial genomes have pointed to unusual biochemical pathways in rumen organisms. One study found that 8% of rumen organisms forming acetate, a major SCFA, had genes for a pathway previously unknown in bacteria. The existence of this pathway was subsequently confirmed biochemically in propionibacteria. The pathway was shown to involve 2 enzymes that convert acetyl-coenzyme A to acetate. Similar studies have revealed new enzymatic steps for forming propionate and butyrate, other major SCFA. These new steps and pathways are significant for controlling fermentation. With more precise control over SCFA, cows can be fed more precisely and potentially reach higher productivity."

We conclude that cyberbullying, while following many of the underlying dynamics of more traditional forms of bullying, features some unique qualities that can both magnify the damage caused and make it more difficult to detect. These features include the pervasive, never-ending nature of cyberbullying and the ability to quickly reach large audiences. The potential for anonymity and the related distance afforded by screens and devices compared to in-person interaction allow the cruelty of cyberbullying to go unchecked. Despite the perceived anonymity of cyberbullying, cyberbullying can be perpetrated by friends, who often have intimate knowledge about the victimised youth that can be devastating when made public. Given the difficulty schools face in preventing or even detecting cyberbullying, health care providers are an important ally, due to their knowledge of the youth, the sense of trust they bring to youth, and their independence from the school setting. We conclude by calling for routine screening of bullying by health care providers who deal with paediatric populations."

Here, we assessed the performance of total WOB to predict extubation failure in invasively ventilated subjects.MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted in 6 adult ICUs at an academic medical center. We enrolled intubated subjects who successfully completed a spontaneous breathing trial, had a rapid shallow breathing index < 105 breaths/min/L, and were deemed ready for extubation by the primary team. Total WOB values were recorded at the end of a 30-min PAV trial. Extubation failure was defined as any respiratory support and/or re-intubation within 72 h of extubation. We compared total WOB scores between groups and performance of total WOB for predicting extubation failure with receiver operating characteristic curves.ResultsOf 61 subjects enrolled, 9.8% (n = 6) required re-intubation, and 50.8% (n = 31) required any respiratory support within 72 h of extubation. Median total WOB at 30 min on PAV was 0.9 J/L (interquartile range 0.7-1.3 J/L). Total WOB was significantly different between subjects who failed or were successfully extubated (median 1.1 J/L vs 0.7 J/L, P = .004). The area under the curve was 0.71 [95% CI 0.58-0.85] for predicting any requirement of respiratory support and 0.85 [95% CI 0.69-1.00] for predicting re-intubation alone within 72 h of extubation. Total WOB cutoff values maximizing sensitivity and specificity equally were 1.0 J/L for any respiratory support (positive predictive value [PPV] 70.0%, negative predictive value [NPV] 67.7%) and 1.3 J/L for re-intubation (PPV 26.3%, NPV 97.6%).ConclusionsThe discriminative performance of a PAV-derived total WOB value to predict extubation failure was good, indicating total WOB may represent an adjunctive tool for assessing extubation readiness. However, these results should be interpreted as preliminary, with specific thresholds of PAV-derived total WOB requiring further investigation in a large multi-center study."

        "abstract": "Clustering large and complex data sets whose partitions may adopt arbitrary shapes remains a difficult challenge. Part of this challenge comes from the difficulty in defining a similarity measure between the data points that captures the underlying geometry of those data points. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, DCG++ that generates such a similarity measure that is data-driven and ultrametric. DCG++ uses Markov Chain Random Walks to capture the intrinsic geometry of data, scans possible scales, and combines all this information using a simple procedure that is shown to generate an ultrametric. We validate the effectiveness of this similarity measure within the context of clustering on synthetic data with complex geometry, on a real-world data set containing segmented audio records of frog calls described by mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, as well as on an image segmentation problem. The experimental results show a significant improvement on performance with the DCG-based ultrametric compared to using an empirical distance measure."

        "abstract": "Connecting the dots among the amino acid sequence of a protein, its structure, and its function remains a central theme in molecular biology, as it would have many applications in the treatment of illnesses related to misfolding or protein instability. As a result of high-throughput sequencing methods, biologists currently live in a protein sequence-rich world. However, our knowledge of protein structure based on experimental data remains comparatively limited. As a consequence, protein structure prediction has established itself as a very active field of research to fill in this gap. This field, once thought to be reserved for theoretical biophysicists, is constantly reinventing itself, borrowing ideas informed by an ever-increasing assembly of scientific domains, from biology, chemistry, (statistical) physics, mathematics, computer science, statistics, bioinformatics, and more recently data sciences. We review the recent progress arising from this integration of knowledge, from the development of specific computer architecture to allow for longer timescales in physics-based simulations of protein folding to the recent advances in predicting contacts in proteins based on detection of coevolution using very large data sets of aligned protein sequences."

Although researchers in several studies have explored parent insights into discharge needs, few have explored perceptions of causes for pediatric readmissions. We sought to investigate factors contributing to pediatric readmissions, from both parent and physician perspectives.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews with parents, discharging and readmitting physicians, and subspecialist consultants of children readmitted within 30 days of initial discharge from the pediatric ward at an urban nonfreestanding children's hospital. Participants were interviewed during the readmission and asked about care transition experiences during the initial admission and potential causes and preventability of readmission. Data were analyzed iteratively by using a constant-comparative approach. We identified major themes, solicited feedback, and inferred relationships between themes to develop a conceptual model for preventing readmissions.ResultsWe conducted 53 interviews from 20 patient readmissions, including 20 parents, 20 readmitting physicians, 11 discharging physicians, and 3 consulting subspecialists. Major themes included the following: (1) unclear roles cause lack of ownership in patient care tasks, (2) lack of collaborative communication leads to discordant understanding of care plans, and (3) incomplete hospital-to-home transitions result in ongoing reliance on the hospital.ConclusionsClear definition of team member roles, improved communication among care team members and between care teams and families, and enhanced care coordination to facilitate the hospital-to-home transition were perceived as potential interventions that may help prevent readmissions."

        "abstract": "Developmental changes in executive function are often explained in terms of core cognitive processes and associated neural substrates. For example, younger children tend to engage control reactively in the moment as needed, whereas older children increasingly engage control proactively, in anticipation of needing it. Such developments may reflect increasing capacities for active maintenance dependent upon dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, younger children will engage proactive control when reactive control is made more difficult, suggesting that developmental changes may also reflect decisions about whether to engage control, and how. We tested awareness of temporal control demands and associated task choices in 5-year-olds and 10-year-olds and adults using a demand selection task. Participants chose between one task that enabled proactive control and another task that enabled reactive control. Adults reported awareness of these different control demands and preferentially played the proactive task option. Ten-year-olds reported awareness of control demands but selected task options at chance. Five-year-olds showed neither awareness nor task preference, but a subsample who exhibited awareness of control demands preferentially played the reactive task option, mirroring their typical control mode. Thus, developmental improvements in executive function may in part reflect better awareness of cognitive demands and adaptive behavior, which may in turn reflect changes in dorsal anterior cingulate in signaling task demands to lateral prefrontal cortex."

We are planning a multicenter, randomized clinical trial evaluating tranexamic acid in children with hemorrhage. Standardization of transfusion practices across sites is important to minimize confounding. Therefore, we sought to generate consensus-based transfusion guidelines for the trial.MethodsWe used a modified Delphi process utilizing a multi-site, multi-disciplinary panel of experts to develop our transfusion guidelines. A survey of 23 clinical categories on various aspects of transfusion practices was developed and distributed via SurveyMonkey\u00c2\u00ae. Statements were graded on a 5-point Likert scale (\"Strongly agree\" to \"This intervention may be harmful\"). Statements were accepted if \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 80% of the panelists rated the statement as \"Strongly agree\" or \"Agree\". After each round, the responses were calculated and the results included on subsequent rounds.Results35 panelists from four pediatric trauma centers participated in the study, including 11 (31%) pediatric EM physicians, 8 (23%) pediatric trauma surgeons, 5 (14%) transfusionists, 5 (14%) pediatric anesthesiologists, and 6 (17%) pediatric critical care physicians (range of 8 to 10 from each clinical site). Four survey iterations were performed. In total 176 statements were rated and 39 were accepted by criteria across all 23 categories. An rational algorithm for transfusion in trauma was then developed.ConclusionsWe successfully developed transfusion guidelines for various aspects of the management of children with hemorrhagic injuries using a modified Delphi process with broad interdisciplinary participation. We anticipate implementation of these guidelines will help minimize heterogeneity of transfusion practices across clinical sites for the upcoming clinical trial evaluating tranexamic acid in children with hemorrhage."

        "title": "The Efficacy of Cognitive Intervention in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): a Meta-Analysis of Outcomes on Neuropsychological Measures",
        "abstract": "Cognitive training in MCI may stimulate pre-existing neural reserves or recruit neural circuitry as \"compensatory scaffolding\" prompting neuroplastic reorganization to meet task demands (Reuter-Lorenz &amp; Park, 2014). However, existing systematic reviews and meta-analytic studies exploring the benefits of cognitive interventions in MCI have been mixed. An updated examination regarding the efficacy of cognitive intervention in MCI is needed given improvements in adherence to MCI diagnostic criteria in subject selection, better defined interventions and strategies applied, increased use of neuropsychological measures pre- and post-intervention, as well as identification of moderator variables which may influence treatment. As such, this meta-analytic review was conducted to examine the efficacy of cognitive intervention in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus MCI controls based on performance of neuropsychological outcome measures in randomized controlled trials (RCT). RCT studies published from January 1995 to June 2017 were obtained through source databases of MEDLINE-R, PubMed, Healthstar, Global Health, PSYCH-INFO, and Health and Psychological Instruments using search parameters for MCI diagnostic category (mild cognitive impairment, MCI, pre-Alzheimer's disease, early cognitive decline, early onset Alzheimer's disease, and preclinical Alzheimer's disease) and the intervention or training conducted (intervention, training, stimulation, rehabilitation, or treatment). Other inclusion and exclusion criteria included subject selection based on established MCI criteria, RCT design in an outpatient setting, MCI controls (active or passive), and outcomes based on objective neuropsychological measures. From the 1199 abstracts identified, 26 articles met inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses completed across eleven (11) countries; 92.31% of which have been published within the past 7&nbsp;years. A series of meta-analyses were performed to examine the effects of cognitive intervention by cognitive domain, type of training, and intervention content (cognitive domain targeted). We found significant, moderate effects for multicomponent training (Hedges' g observed\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.398; CI [0.164, 0.631]; Z\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20303.337; p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001; Q\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203055.511; df\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203015; p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.000; I 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203072.978%; \u00cf\u201e 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.146) as well as multidomain-focused strategies (Hedges' g\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.230; 95% CI [0.108, 0.352]; Z\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20303.692; p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<&nbsp;0.001; Q\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203012.713; df\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203012; p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.390; I 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20305.612; \u00cf\u201e 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.003). The effects for other interventions explored by cognitive domain, training type, or intervention content were indeterminate due to concerns for heterogeneity, bias, and small cell sizes. In addition, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted with the moderators of MCI category, mode of intervention, training type, intervention content, program duration (total hours), type of control group (active or passive), post-intervention follow-up assessment period, and control for repeat administration. We found significant overall effects for intervention content with memory focused interventions appearing to be more effective than multidomain approaches. There was no evidence of an influence on outcomes for the other covariates examined. Overall, these findings suggest individuals with MCI who received multicomponent training or interventions targeting multiple domains (including lifestyle changes) were apt to display an improvement on outcome measures of cognition post-intervention. As such, multicomponent and multidomain forms of intervention may prompt recruitment of alternate neural processes as well as support primary networks to meet task demands simultaneously. In addition, interventions with memory and multidomain forms of content appear to be particularly helpful, with memory-based approaches possibly being more effective than multidomain methods. Other factors, such as program duration, appear to have less of an influence on intervention outcomes. Given this, although the creation of new primary network paths appears strained in MCI, interventions with memory-based or multidomain forms of content may facilitate partial activation of compensatory scaffolding and neuroplastic reorganization. The positive benefit of memory-based strategies may also reflect transfer effects indicative of compensatory network activation and the multiple-pathways involved in memory processes. Limitations of this review are similar to other meta-analysis in MCI, including&nbsp;a modest number studies, small sample sizes, multiple forms of interventions and types of training applied (some overlapping), and, while greatly improved in our view, a&nbsp;large diversity of instruments used to measure outcome. This is apt to have contributed to the presence of heterogeneity and publication bias precluding a&nbsp;more definitive determination of the outcomes observed."

        "abstract": "BackgroundStruvite urolithiasis with bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) is commonly reported in dogs; few data exist to describe successful dissolution protocols in dogs with naturally occurring disease. We hypothesized that a dry therapeutic urinary diet combined with targeted antimicrobial therapy can effectively dissolve presumptive struvite cystolithiasis in dogs with naturally occurring urease-producing bacterial UTI.ResultsTen dogs with presumed infection-induced struvite cystolithiasis based on lower urinary tract signs (LUTS), radiodense cystoliths, and urease-producing bacterial UTI were enrolled. At enrollment, antimicrobials and dry therapeutic urinary diet were dispensed. In addition to lack of radiographic resolution of urolithiasis, dogs with persistent clinical signs were considered non-responders. There was no significant difference in pH between responders and non-responders; USG was significantly higher in the responder group. Recheck visits continued until radiographic dissolution or failure was documented. Five of the 10 dogs achieved radiographic dissolution of cystolithiasis within a median of 31\u00e2\u20ac\u2030days (range 19-103). In the other 5 dogs, surgical urolith removal was necessary due to persistent LUTS (3 dogs within 2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030weeks) or lack of continued dissolution noted radiographically (1 dog with numerous cystoliths failed at day 91; 1 dog failed by day 57 with questionable owner compliance).ConclusionsDissolution of urinary tract infection induced struvite cystoliths can be accomplished in some dogs fed this dry therapeutic urinary diet in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy. Case selection could increase the likelihood of successful dissolution; however, if calcium phosphate is present, this could also prevent stone dissolution. If clinical signs persist despite diet and antimicrobials, stone removal is advised."

The objectives of this study were to describe the use of a novel drug-eluting embolic microsphere containing paclitaxel for use during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), to compare results of liver-specific owner questionnaires and tumor volume pre- and post-TACE, and to measure systemic paclitaxel concentration post-TACE. Client-owned dogs with non-resectable hepatic neoplasia were prospectively enrolled. All owners completed questionnaires validated for the assessment of subjective outcomes in dogs with cancer before the TACE procedure and approximately 4 weeks after the TACE procedure. A CT scan was performed before TACE and 1 month after TACE; results were compared. Blood samples were obtained at specified time points post-TACE to determine systemic paclitaxel concentrations. Seven dogs (median weight: 8.9 kg; range, 4.3-31 kg) were enrolled. TACE was successfully performed in all dogs, and no intra-procedural complications were encountered. Questionnaire scores improved significantly post-TACE. Among the 6 dogs for which full data were available, median pre-TACE tumor volume was 390 cc (range 152-1,484; interquartile range 231-1,139) and median post-TACE tumor volume was 203 cc (range 98-889; interquartile range 151-369), which was significantly (P = .028) lower. All 6 dogs had a reduction in volume at the post-TACE measurement. Mean percent change in tumor volume was -45.6% (95%CI -58.6 to -32.6%). The mean plasma paclitaxel concentration in canine blood peaked at 4 days post-TACE procedure and was 25.7 ng/mL (range = 3.09-110 ng/mL) Median survival time was 629 days (95%CI 18 to upper limit not reached). The use of a novel paclitaxel-eluting microsphere in this cohort of dogs successfully decreased tumor volume significantly after TACE and improved clinical signs. Future investigation into the use of TACE and other similar therapies is warranted due to the promising outcomes noted in this cohort."

Results from studies in rodents and some clinical investigations suggest that meal time manipulation may be a potential lifestyle approach against conditions involving perturbations in glucose homeostasis (e.g., hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, diabetes, etc.). The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the current literature on the role of meal timing and daily nutrient distribution on glycemic control during pregnancy. Only a small number of mostly observational studies have assessed the role of meal timing in glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. Food consumption earlier in the day and short-term fasting with adequate nutrient intake may improve glycemic control during the second and third trimester of gestation. Considering that the field of chrononutrition is still in its infancy and many questions remain unanswered, future prospective and carefully designed studies are needed to better understand the role of meal timing in metabolic homeostasis and maternal and fetal health outcomes during pregnancy."

However, the role of human BAT in plasma BCAA clearance is poorly understood. Here, we evaluate patients with prostate cancer who underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging after an injection of 18F-fluciclovine (L-leucine analog). Supraclavicular adipose tissue (AT; primary location of human BAT) has a higher net uptake rate for 18F-fluciclovine compared to subcutaneous abdominal and upper chest AT. Supraclavicular AT 18F-fluciclovine net uptake rate is lower in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Finally, the expression of genes involved in BCAA catabolism is higher in the supraclavicular AT of healthy people with high BAT volume compared to those with low BAT volume. These findings support the notion that BAT can potentially function as a metabolic sink for plasma BCAA clearance in people."

Relations between factors potentially associated with hippocampal size and growth were investigated.MethodParticipants received 1 to 3 structural magnetic resonance imaging scans between ages 25 and 80 months (unique participants: ASD, n&nbsp;=200; TD, n&nbsp;=110; total longitudinal scans, n&nbsp;= 593). HV growth during this period was examined using mixed-effects linear models. Associations between early HV and growth rates, and IQ and adaptive functioning, were evaluated.ResultsAfter accounting for cerebral hemisphere volume, male participants exhibited larger left and right HV than female participants. Hippocampal growth rates did not differ by sex. In children with larger hemisphere volumes, male and female participants with ASD had relatively larger HV than TD participants of similar hemisphere volume. This effect was present in a broader group than only those with disproportionate megalencephaly (male participants with large cerebral volumes relative to body size). Right hippocampi were larger than left hippocampi in both groups and sexes. Right versus left volume differences were greater for ASD. After adjusting for hemisphere volume, male participants with ASD showed a significant positive association between right hippocampal growth and adaptive behavior.ConclusionHV was relatively greater in ASD in analyses adjusting for hemisphere volume, whereas only subtle differences were observed in HV and growth between participants with ASD and TD participants in unadjusted analyses, suggesting that ASD involves atypical coupling between HV and brain size."

        "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough the genome for the allotetraploid bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has been established, limitations in mutant resources have hampered in planta gene function studies toward crop optimization. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a versatile technique for transient genetic studies. Here we report the implementation of foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV)-mediated gene silencing in switchgrass in above- and below-ground tissues and at different developmental stages.ResultsThe study demonstrated that leaf rub-inoculation is a suitable method for systemic gene silencing in switchgrass. For all three visual marker genes, Magnesium chelatase subunit D (ChlD) and I (ChlI) as well as phytoene desaturase (PDS), phenotypic changes were observed in leaves, albeit at different intensities. Gene silencing efficiency was verified by RT-PCR for all tested genes. Notably, systemic gene silencing was also observed in roots, although silencing efficiency was stronger in leaves (~\u00e2\u20ac\u203063-94%) as compared to roots (~\u00e2\u20ac\u203048-78%). Plants at a later developmental stage were moderately less amenable to VIGS than younger plants, but also less perturbed by the viral infection.ConclusionsUsing FoMV-mediated VIGS could be achieved in switchgrass leaves and roots, providing an alternative approach for studying gene functions and physiological traits in this important bioenergy crop."

        "abstract": "ObjectivesHead and neck cancer surgeons frequently interact with dying patients with advanced disease and their families, but little is known about their bereavement practices after a patient's death. The aim of this study is to elucidate the frequency of common bereavement practices, cited barriers to bereavement, and predictive physician factors that lead to an increase in bereavement practices among head and neck cancer surgeons.MethodsA 20-item survey was sent to 827 active surgeons of the American Head and Neck Society. Approval was obtained and the survey was distributed through the American Head and Neck Society. Demographics, frequency of common bereavement practices, empathy, and barriers were assessed. Multiple linear regression was performed to determine physician factors associated with more frequent bereavement follow-up.ResultsThere were 156 respondents (18.9% response rate). Overall, surgeons were more likely to usually/always call (48.5%) or send a letter (42.4%) compared with other practices such as attending funerals (0%), offering family meetings (18.6%), or referring family members to counseling (7.7%). Many barriers were cited as being at least somewhat important: being unaware about a patient's death (67.3%) was the most cited, whereas 51.3% cited a lack of mentorship/training in this area. Scoring higher on empathy questions (P&nbsp;\u00e2\u2030\u00a4\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.001) was associated with more frequent surgeon bereavement follow-up with the family of deceased patients.ConclusionThere is substantial practice variation among surgeons suggesting a lack of consensus on their roles in bereavement follow-up. Having higher empathy was predictive of higher engagement.Level of evidenceNA Laryngoscope, 132:1971-1975, 2022."

Demographic and clinical variables were abstracted from electronic medical records. We evaluated the association between consultation modality and visit completion in overall and matched samples using hierarchical multivariable logistic regression.ResultsWe analyzed 13,311 in-person appointments by 3,831 patients and 1,158 telemedicine appointments by 381 patients. The average travel time to the site of care was 45.8 \u00c2\u00b1 52.1 minutes for the in-person cohort and 22.3 \u00c2\u00b1 22.7 minutes for the telemedicine cohort. Telemedicine sites were located at an average travel time of 217.1 \u00c2\u00b1 114.8 minutes from UCDH. Telemedicine patients were more likely to have nonprivate insurance, lower education, and lower household income. They had different diagnoses and fewer complex chronic conditions. Telemedicine visits were more likely to be completed than either \"cancelled\" or missed (\"no show\") compared with in-person visits (OR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.34-1.83; OR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.31-2.10 matched on travel time to the site of care; OR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.66-2.98 matched on travel time to UCDH).ConclusionsThe use of telemedicine for outpatient pediatric neurology visits has high odds of completion and can serve as an equal adjunct to in-person clinic visits."

        "abstract": "Children's explicit theory of mind (ToM) understandings change over early childhood. We examined whether there is longitudinal stability in the neurobiological bases of ToM across this time period. A previous study found that source-localized resting EEG alpha attributable to the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ) was associated with children's performance on a battery of theory of mind tasks. Here, we investigated a small subset of children (N\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203012) in that original study as a preliminary investigation of whether behavioral measures of ToM performance, and/or EEG localized to the DMPFC or RTPJ predicted ToM-specific fMRI responses 3.5 years later. Results showed that preschoolers' behavioral ToM-performance positively predicted later ToM-specific fMRI responses in the DMPFC. Preschoolers' resting EEG attributable to the DMPFC also predicted later ToM-specific fMRI responses in the DMPFC. Given the small sample, results represent a first exploration and require replication. Intriguingly, they suggest that early maturation of the area of the DMPFC related to ToM reasoning is positively linked with its specific recruitment for ToM reasoning later in development, affording implications for characterizing conceptual ToM development, and its underlying neural supports."

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate overall survival (OS). The cumulative incidences of disease-specific death, local failure, regional failure, and distant metastasis were calculated with death as a competing risk.ResultsOne hundred twenty-three patients were identified. Median follow-up for living patients was 54 months and 16 months for all patients. Ninety-one patients had salvage surgery followed by adjuvant RT. Definitive RT was utilized in the remaining 32 patients. The 5-year OS was 40%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of disease-specific death, local failure, regional failure, and distant metastasis was 55%, 34%, 22%, and 20%, respectively. Recurrent T classification and lack of salvage surgery were independently associated with worse disease-specific death and decreased OS, respectively. Subset analysis of patients who underwent salvage surgery demonstrated that age, recurrent T classification, and perineural invasion (PNI) were independently associated with decreased OS; recurrent T classification and thicker tumors were independently associated with worse disease-specific death; and positive/close margins and primary T classification were independently associated with increased local failure.ConclusionIn this group of patients with recurrent OCC, clinical outcomes were similar or improved when compared with other recurrent OCC-specific reports. In the salvage surgery subset, tumor thickness and PNI are recurrent pathologic features associated with outcomes that were only previously demonstrated in studies of primary disease. Because of the relatively worse outcomes in patients receiving definitive or adjuvant RT for recurrent OCC, we advocate for the appropriate use of postoperative RT in the initial management of oral cavity cancers."

        "abstract": "Secondary bile acids promote gastrointestinal (GI) tract permeabilization both in vivo and in vitro. Consumption of high fat diets increases bile acid levels in the GI tract which can contribute to intestinal permeabilization and consequent local and systemic inflammation. This work investigated the mechanisms involved in bile acid (deoxycholic acid (DCA))-induced intestinal epithelial cell monolayer permeabilization and the preventive capacity of (-)-epicatechin (EC). While EC prevented high fat diet-induced intestinal permeabilization in mice, it did not mitigate the associated increase in fecal/cecal total and individual bile acids. In vitro, using differentiated Caco-2\u00e2\u20ac\u00afcells as a model of epithelial barrier, EC and other NADPH oxidase inhibitors (VAS-2870 and apocynin) mitigated DCA-induced Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization. While EC inhibited DCA-mediated increase in cell oxidants, it did not prevent DCA-induced mitochondrial oxidant production. Prevention of DCA-induced ERK1/2 activation with EC, VAS-2870, apocynin and the MEK inhibitor U0126, also prevented monolayer permeabilization, stressing the key involvement of ERK1/2 in this process and its redox regulation. Downstream, DCA promoted myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation which was related to MLC phosphatase (MLCP) inhibition by ERK1/2. DCA also decreased the levels of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, which can be related to MMP-2 activation and consequent ZO-1 and occludin degradation. Both events were prevented by EC, NADPH oxidase and ERK1/2 inhibitors. Thus, DCA-induced Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization occurs mainly secondary to a redox-regulated ERK1/2 activation and downstream disruption of TJ structure and dynamic. EC's capacity to mitigate in vivo the gastrointestinal permeabilization caused by consumption of high-fat diets can be in part related to its capacity to inhibit bile-induced NADPH oxidase and ERK1/2 activation."

When weighted, this sample represented approximately 233,000 children involved in the child welfare system and in special education. Results from latent class analyses revealed four maltreatment classes, listed by predominance: supervisory neglect, physical abuse, other forms of maltreatment, and sexual abuse. Relative to children in the sexual abuse class, children had higher teacher-reported internalizing problem behaviors if their predominate maltreatment class was either supervisory neglect or physical abuse.

Fifty-six crossbred pigs (approximately 32.99 kg body weight) were assigned to one of two treatments with seven replicate pens and four pigs per pen. Pigs were fed with control (corn-soybean meal diets) or food waste from d 0 to 53, while all pigs were fed with the control diet from d 53 to 79. The 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze microbiota of feces collected on d 0, 28, 53, and 79. Meat quality and carcass characteristics were measured in one pig per pen at the end of the experiment. Pigs fed with food waste contained more (p < 0.05) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in back-fat. Feeding food waste increased (p < 0.05) the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, but decreased (p < 0.05) the relative abundances of Streptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae in feces on d 29 or d 53. In conclusion, feeding enzymatically digested food waste did not affect pork quality, but provided more beneficial fatty acids to pork consumers and altered the fecal microbiota in growing-finishing pigs."

        "abstract": "Many scientific investigations of photometric galaxy surveys require redshift estimates, whose uncertainty properties are best encapsulated by photometric redshift (photo-z) posterior probability density functions (PDFs). A plethora of photo-z PDF estimation methodologies abound, producing discrepant results with no consensus on a preferred approach. We present the results of a comprehensive experiment comparing 12 photo-z algorithms applied to mock data produced for The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Dark Energy Science Collaboration. By supplying perfect prior information, in the form of the complete template library and a representative training set as inputs to each code, we demonstrate the impact of the assumptions underlying each technique on the output photo-z PDFs. In the absence of a notion of true, unbiased photo-z PDFs, we evaluate and interpret multiple metrics of the ensemble properties of the derived photo-z PDFs as well as traditional reductions to photo-z point estimates. We report systematic biases and overall over/underbreadth of the photo-z PDFs of many popular codes, which may indicate avenues for improvement in the algorithms or implementations. Furthermore, we raise attention to the limitations of established metrics for assessing photo-z PDF accuracy; though we identify the conditional density estimate loss as a promising metric of photo-z PDF performance in the case where true redshifts are available but true photo-z PDFs are not, we emphasize the need for science-specific performance metrics."

In particular, single-cell transcriptomics has led to fundamental new insights into animal biology, such as the discovery of new cell types and cell type-specific disease processes. However, the application of single-cell approaches to plants, fungi, algae, or bacteria (environmental organisms) has been far more limited, largely due to the challenges posed by polysaccharide walls surrounding these species' cells. In this perspective, we discuss opportunities afforded by single-cell technologies for energy and environmental science and grand challenges that must be tackled to apply these approaches to plants, fungi and algae. We highlight the need to develop better and more comprehensive single-cell technologies, analysis and visualization tools, and tissue preparation methods. We advocate for the creation of a centralized, open-access database to house plant single-cell data. Finally, we consider how such efforts should balance the need for deep characterization of select model species while still capturing the diversity in the plant kingdom. Investments into the development of methods, their application to relevant species, and the creation of resources to support data dissemination will enable groundbreaking insights to propel energy and environmental science forward."

        "abstract": "Contamination of edible produce leaves with human bacterial pathogens has been associated with serious disease outbreaks and has become a major public health concern affecting all aspects of the market, from farmers to consumers. While pathogen populations residing on the surface of ready-to-eat produce can be potentially removed through thorough washing, there is no disinfection technology available that effectively eliminates internal bacterial populations. By screening 303 multi-gene deletion (MGD) mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) 14028s, we were able to identify ten genomic regions that play a role in opening the stomatal pore of lettuce leaves. The major metabolic functions of the deleted regions are associated with sensing the environment, bacterium movement, transport through the bacterial membrane, and biosynthesis of surface appendages. Interestingly, at 21 days post inoculation, seven of these mutants showed increased population titers inside the leaf, two mutants showed similar titers as the wild type bacterium, whereas one mutant with a large deletion that includes the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) showed significantly impaired persistence in the leaf apoplast. These findings suggest that not all the genomic regions required for initiation of leaf colonization (i.e., epiphytic behavior and tissue penetration) are essential for continuing bacterial survival as an endophyte. We also observed that mutants lacking either SPI-1 (Mut3) or SPI-2 (Mut9) induce callose deposition levels comparable to those of the wild type STm 14028s; therefore, these islands do not seem to affect this lettuce defense mechanism. However, the growth of Mut9, but not Mut3, was significantly impaired in the leaf apoplastic wash fluid (AWF) suggesting that the STm persistence in the apoplast may be linked to nutrient acquisition capabilities or overall bacterial fitness in this niche, which are dependent on the gene(s) deleted in the Mut9 strain. The genetic basis of STm colonization of leaves investigated in this study provides a foundation from which to develop mitigation tactics to enhance food safety."

This is the first view of an intact human virus complexed with a monoclonal Fab (Fab17-IA) for which both atomic structures are known. The surface area on HRV type 14 (HRV14) in contact with Fab17-IA was approximately 500 A2 (5 nm2), which is much larger than the area that constitutes the NIm-IA epitope (on viral protein VP1) defined by natural escape mutants. From modeling studies and electrostatic potential calculations, charged residues outside the neutralizing immunogenic site IA (NIm-IA) were also predicted to be involved in antibody recognition. These predictions were confirmed by site-specific mutations and analysis of the Fab17-IA-HRV14 complex, along with knowledge of the crystallographic structures of HRV14 and Fab17-IA. The bound Fab17-IA reaches across a surface depression (the canyon) and meets a related Fab at the nearest icosahedral twofold axis. By adjusting the elbow angles of the bound Fab fragments from 162 degrees to 198 degrees, an intact antibody molecule can be easily modeled. This, along with aggregation and binding stoichiometry results, supports the earlier proposal that this antibody binds bivalently to the surface of HRV14 across icosahedral twofold axes. One prediction of this model, that the intact canyon-spanning immunoglobulin G molecule would block attachment of the virus to HeLa cells, was confirmed experimentally."

        "abstract": "CD40L is a member of the TNF superfamily that participates in immune cell activation. It binds to and signals through several integrins, including \u00ce\u00b1v\u00ce\u00b23 and \u00ce\u00b15\u00ce\u00b21, which bind to the trimeric interface of CD40L. We previously showed that several integrin ligands can bind to the allosteric site (site 2), which is distinct from the classical ligand-binding site (site 1), raising the question of if CD40L activates integrins. In our explorations of this question, we determined that integrin \u00ce\u00b14\u00ce\u00b21, which is prevalently expressed on the same CD4+ T cells as CD40L, is another receptor for CD40L. Soluble (s)CD40L activated soluble integrins \u00ce\u00b1v\u00ce\u00b23, \u00ce\u00b15\u00ce\u00b21, and \u00ce\u00b14\u00ce\u00b21 in cell-free conditions, indicating that this activation does not require inside-out signaling. Moreover, sCD40L activated cell-surface integrins in CHO cells that do not express CD40. To learn more about the mechanism of binding, we determined that sCD40L bound to a cyclic peptide from site 2. Docking simulations predicted that the residues of CD40L that bind to site 2 are located outside of the CD40L trimer interface, at a site where four HIGM1 (hyper-IgM syndrome type 1) mutations are clustered. We tested the effect of these mutations, finding that the K143T and G144E mutants were the most defective in integrin activation, providing support that this region interacts with site 2. We propose that allosteric integrin activation by CD40L also plays a role in CD40L signaling, and defective site 2 binding may be related to the impaired CD40L signaling functions of these HIGM1 mutants."

However, there has been a divide where specialized solutions were often deployed to support either OLTP or OLAP workloads but not both; thus, limiting the analysis to stale and possibly irrelevant data. In this paper, we present Lineage-based Data Store (L-Store) that combines the realtime processing of transactional and analytical workloads within a single unified engine by introducing a novel update-friendly lineage-based storage architecture. By exploiting the lineage, we develop a contention-free and lazy staging of columnar data from a write-optimized form (suitable for OLTP) into a read-optimized form (suitable for OLAP) in a transactionally consistent approach that supports querying and retaining the current and historic data."

Such regulations are, often ambiguous (with multiple valid interpretations) when it comes to defining the expected dynamic behavior of data processing systems. This paper argues that it is possible to represent regulations such as GDPR formally as invariants using a (small set of) data processing concepts that capture system behavior. When such concepts are grounded, i.e., they are provided with a single unambiguous interpretation, systems can achieve compliance by demonstrating that the system-actions they implement maintain the invariants (representing the regulations). To illustrate our vision, we propose Data-CASE, a simple yet powerful model that (a) captures key data processing concepts (b) a set of invariants that describe regulations in terms of these concepts. We further illustrate the concept of grounding using \"deletion\" as an example and highlight several ways in which end-users, companies, and software designers/engineers can use Data-CASE."

        "abstract": "Epileptic encephalopathies are severe forms of infantile-onset epilepsy often complicated by severe neurodevelopmental impairments. Some forms of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) have been associated with variants in SCN2A, which encodes the brain voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2. Many voltage-gated sodium channel genes, including SCN2A, undergo developmentally regulated mRNA splicing. The early onset of these disorders suggests that developmentally regulated alternative splicing of NaV1.2 may be an important consideration when elucidating the pathophysiological consequences of epilepsy-associated variants. We hypothesized that EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants would exhibit greater dysfunction in a splice isoform that is prominently expressed during early development. We engineered five EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants (T236S, E999K, S1336Y, T1623N, and R1882Q) into the adult and neonatal splice isoforms of NaV1.2 and performed whole-cell voltage clamp to elucidate their functional properties. All variants exhibited functional defects that could enhance neuronal excitability. Three of the five variants (T236S, E999K, and S1336Y) exhibited greater dysfunction in the neonatal isoform compared with those observed in the adult isoform. Computational modeling of a developing cortical pyramidal neuron indicated that T236S, E999K, S1336Y, and R1882Q showed hyperexcitability preferentially in immature neurons. These results suggest that both splice isoform and neuronal developmental stage influence how EOEE-associated NaV1.2 variants affect neuronal excitability."

        "abstract": "The Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) mouse model is a vital tool for studying the pathophysiology of bariatric surgery and contributes greatly to research on obesity and diabetes. However, complications including postsurgical hypoglycemia can have profoundly negative effects. Unlike in humans, blood glucose (BG) is not typically managed in postoperative rodents, despite their critical role as translational models; without this management, rodents can experience hypoglycemia, potentially impairing wound healing, decreasing survivability, complicating interpretation of research data, and limiting translational utility. In this project, we sought to identify an optimal method for minimally invasive administration of dextrose in C57BL/6N (n = 16; 8 male, 8 female) mice. To do so, we characterized BG pharmacokinetic profiles after subcutaneous and oral-transmucosal (OTM) administration of dextrose. Compared with OTM dosage, the subcutaneous route provided more consistent and reliable delivery of glucose and did not cause significant adverse reactions. We then evaluated the frequency of hypoglycemic events after RYGB in C57BL/6N mice (n = 16; 8 male, 8 female) and the effects of subcutaneous dextrose supplementation on morbidity and mortality. BG measurement and behavioral pain assessment (grimace test) were performed for 3 d after surgery. Hypoglycemic (BG \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 60 mg/dL) animals were assigned to dose (5% dextrose SC) or no-dose treatment groups. Nearly all (87%) mice became hypoglycemic; 2 of these mice died. No significant intergroup difference in grimace score or mortality was detected. Overall, our results demonstrate that hypoglycemia is a frequent adverse event after RYGB in mice and that subcutaneous injection of dextrose is a safe and effective way to manage hypoglycemia. Further studies are necessary to optimize the intervention threshold and optimal dosage; regardless, we recommend glycemic management after RYGB surgery in mice."

In 2016, participants at the Western States Endurance Run (WSER), a 100-mile (161-km) foot race, underwent non-targeted metabolomic testing of their post-race plasma. Metabolites associated with faster finish times were identified. Based on these results, runners at the 2017 WSER underwent targeted metabolomics testing, including lipidomics and choline levels. The 2017 participants' plasma metabolites were correlated with finish times and compared with non-athletic controls. In 2016, 427 known molecules were detected using non-targeted metabolomics. Four compounds, all phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were associated with finish time (False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05). All were higher in faster finishers. In 2017, using targeted PC analysis, multiple PCs, measured pre- and post-race, were higher in faster finishers (FDR < 0.05). The majority of PCs was noted to be higher in runners (both pre- and post-race) than in controls (FDR < 0.05). Runners had higher choline levels pre-race compared to controls (p < 0.0001), but choline level did not differ significantly from controls post-race (p = 0.129). Choline levels decreased between the start and the finish of the race (p < 0.0001). Faster finishers had lower choline levels than slower finishers at the race finish (p = 0.028)."

        "abstract": "Saccharides in our diet are major sources of carbon for the formation of biomass such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and glycans. Among the dietary monosaccharides, glucose occupies a central role in metabolism, but human blood contains regulated levels of other monosaccharides as well. Their influence on metabolism and how they are utilized have not been explored thoroughly. Applying metabolic flux analysis on glycan synthesis can reveal the pathways that supply glycosylation precursors and provide a snapshot of the metabolic state of the cell. In this study, we traced the incorporation of six 13C uniformly labeled monosaccharides in the N-glycans, O-glycans and glycosphingolipids of both pluripotent and neural NTERA-2 cells. We gathered detailed isotopologue data for hundreds of glycoconjugates using mass spectrometry methods. The contributions of de novo synthesis and direct incorporation pathways for glucose, mannose, fructose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine and fucose were determined based on their isotope incorporation. Co-feeding studies revealed that fructose incorporation is drastically decreased by the presence of glucose, while mannose and galactose were much less affected. Furthermore, increased sialylation slowed down the turnover of glycans, but fucosylation attenuated this effect. Our results demonstrated that exogenous monosaccharide utilization can vary markedly depending on the cell differentiation state and monosaccharide availability, and that the incorporation of carbons can also differ among different glycan structures. We contend that the analysis of metabolic isotope labeling of glycans can yield new insights about cell metabolism."

        "abstract": "The mechanisms by which oligodendroglia modulate CNS angiogenesis remain elusive. Previous in vitro data suggest that oligodendroglia regulate CNS endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation through hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF\u00ce\u00b1)-activated Wnt (but not VEGF) signaling. Using in vivo genetic models, we show that HIF\u00ce\u00b1 in oligodendroglia is necessary and sufficient for angiogenesis independent of CNS regions. At the molecular level, HIF\u00ce\u00b1 stabilization in oligodendroglia does not perturb Wnt signaling but rather activates VEGF. At the functional level, genetically blocking oligodendroglia-derived VEGF but not Wnt significantly decreases oligodendroglial HIF\u00ce\u00b1-regulated CNS angiogenesis. Blocking astroglia-derived Wnt signaling reduces astroglial HIF\u00ce\u00b1-regulated CNS angiogenesis. Together, our in vivo data demonstrate that oligodendroglial HIF\u00ce\u00b1 regulates CNS angiogenesis through Wnt-independent and VEGF-dependent signaling. These findings suggest an alternative mechanistic understanding of CNS angiogenesis by postnatal glial cells and unveil a glial cell type-dependent HIF\u00ce\u00b1-Wnt axis in regulating CNS vessel formation."

        "abstract": "Modern antiretroviral therapy for immunodeficiency viruses, although remarkably effective in controlling viral transcription, and overt virus-associated morbidity, has failed to absolutely eradicate retroviruses from their infected hosts as a result of proviral integration in long-lived reservoir cells. Immunodeficiency virus-infected patients are therefore consigned to lifelong antiviral therapy as a means to control viremia, viral transmission, and infection-associated morbidity. Unfortunately, lifelong antiviral therapies can be difficult for patients to continuously maintain and may be associated with therapy-specific morbidities. Patient advocates have argued for new methods to achieve retroviral eradication. As a proof-of-concept study, a lentivirus-delivered RNA-directed gene editing strategy was utilized in a series of in vitro experiments in an attempt to attenuate the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral load, viral transcription, and production of infectious virions. We found that a feline T lymphocyte cell line (MCH5-4) treated with an FIV-specific clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing tool resulted in a reduction of cell-free viral RNA relative to control cells. Decreased infectious potential was demonstrated in a two-step FIV infection study-na\u00c3\u00afve MCH5-4 cells infected with cell-free FIV harvested from FIV-infected and CRISPR lentivirus-treated cells had less integrated proviral DNA than control cells. This study represents the initial steps towards the development of an effective method of proviral eradication in an immunodeficiency virus-infected host."

However these weapons possess serious lethal potential and have led to numerous injuries and deaths. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We describe a 21 year old man who sustained a penetrating cardiac wound from a pellet gun that led to cardiac tamponade and death. Post-mortem examination showed the pellet had penetrated the left ventricle and anterior esophagus with subsequent intraluminal migration into the stomach. DISCUSSION: Review of the literature identified 39 other cases of penetrating cardiac injuries from air guns. Sternotomy was the most frequently used surgical approach and the right and left ventricles were the most commonly affected chambers. Bullet embolization was the most frequently reported complication. Including our case, five deaths related to penetrating cardiac injury from air guns were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the seriousness of air guns and demonstrates a unique intra-thoracic injury."

        "abstract": "NAD+ is an essential metabolite participating in cellular biochemical processes and signaling. The regulation and interconnection among multiple NAD+ biosynthesis pathways are incompletely understood. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells lacking the N-terminal (Nt) protein acetyltransferase complex NatB exhibit an approximate 50% reduction in NAD+ levels and aberrant metabolism of NAD+ precursors, changes that are associated with a decrease in nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) protein levels. Here, we show that this decrease in NAD+ and Nmnat protein levels is specifically due to the absence of Nt-acetylation of Nmnat (Nma1 and Nma2) proteins and not of other NatB substrates. Nt-acetylation critically regulates protein degradation by the N-end rule pathways, suggesting that the absence of Nt-acetylation may alter Nmnat protein stability. Interestingly, the rate of protein turnover (t\u00c2\u00bd) of non-Nt-acetylated Nmnats did not significantly differ from those of Nt-acetylated Nmnats. Accordingly, deletion or depletion of the N-end rule pathway ubiquitin E3 ligases in NatB mutants did not restore NAD+ levels. Next, we examined whether the status of Nt-acetylation would affect the translation of Nmnats, finding that the absence of Nt-acetylation does not significantly alter the polysome formation rate on Nmnat mRNAs. However, we observed that NatB mutants have significantly reduced Nmnat protein maturation. Our findings indicate that the reduced Nmnat levels in NatB mutants are mainly due to inefficient protein maturation. Nmnat activities are essential for all NAD+ biosynthesis routes, and understanding the regulation of Nmnat protein homeostasis may improve our understanding of the molecular basis and regulation of NAD+ metabolism."

A synthetic biological module, however, can be designed to reprogram the host proteome, which in turn enhances the function of the synthetic module. Here, we apply this holistic synthetic biology concept to the engineering of cell-free systems by exploiting the crosstalk between metabolic networks in cells, leading to a protein environment more favorable for protein synthesis. Specifically, we show that local modules expressing translation machinery can reprogram the bacterial proteome, changing the expression levels of more than 700 proteins. The resultant feedback generates a cell-free system that can synthesize fluorescent reporters, protein nanocages, and the gene-editing nuclease Cas9, with up to 5-fold higher expression level than classical cell-free systems. Our work demonstrates a holistic approach that integrates synthetic and systems biology concepts to achieve outcomes not possible by only local, orthogonal circuits."

Ventilation images were calculated with deformable image registration to map the end-expiratory and end-inspiratory CT images and quantitative analysis for regional volume changes as surrogates for ventilation. Perfusion images were calculated by subtracting the end-inspiratory precontrast CT from the deformably registered end-inspiratory postcontrast CT, yielding a map of regional Hounsfield unit enhancement as a surrogate for perfusion. Ventilation-perfusion matching, spatial heterogeneity, and gravitationally directed gradients were compared between two groups using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.ResultsThe normal group had significantly higher Dice similarity coefficients for spatial overlap of segmented functional volumes between ventilation and perfusion (median 0.40 vs. 0.33, p\u00e2\u20ac\u00af=\u00e2\u20ac\u00af0.05), suggesting stronger ventilation-perfusion matching. The normal group also had greater Spearman's correlation coefficients based on 16 regions of interest (median 0.58 vs. 0.40, p\u00e2\u20ac\u00af=\u00e2\u20ac\u00af0.09).

This pilot study investigated the genomic pathways by which the WD and hyperlipidemia regulate gene expression in brain microvessels. Five-week-old C57BL/6J wild type (WT) control and low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDL-R-/-) male mice were fed the WD for eight weeks. Differential gene expression, gene networks and pathways, transcription factors, and non-protein coding RNAs were evaluated by a genome-wide microarray and bioinformatics analysis of laser-captured hippocampal microvessels. The WD resulted in the differential expression of 1972 genes. Much of the differentially expressed gene (DEG) was attributable to the differential regulation of cell signaling proteins and their transcription factors, approximately 4% was attributable to the differential expression of miRNAs, and 10% was due to other non-protein coding RNAs, primarily long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) not previously described to be modified by the WD. Lipotoxic injury resulted in complex and multilevel molecular regulation of the hippocampal microvasculature involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation and may provide a molecular basis for a better understanding of hyperlipidemia-associated dementia risk."

        "abstract": "The growing interest in bioactive compounds, especially in polyphenols, is due to their abundance in the human diet and potentially positive effects on health. The consumption of polyphenols has been shown to possess anti-diabetic properties by preventing insulin resistance or insulin secretion through different signaling pathways, this effect is associated with their capacity to exert genomic modulations. Several studies have suggested that polyphenols could also bind to cellular proteins and modulate their activity, however, the mechanisms of action underlying their beneficial effects are complex and are not fully understood. The aim of this work was to characterize phenolic compounds present in blue corn and black bean extracts as well as identify their potential interactions with target proteins involved in diabetes pathogenesis using in silico approach. Total polyphenols content of both blue corn and black beans was identified using UPLC-ESI/qTOF/MS and quantified by colorimetric assays. In this work we identified twenty-eight phenolic compounds in the extracts, mainly anthocyanins, flavonols, hydroxycinamic acids, dihydroxybenzoic acids, flavones, isoflavones, and flavanols. Interactome of these compounds with thirteen target proteins involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus was performed in-silico. In total, 312 bioactive compounds/protein interaction analyses were acquired. Molecular docking results highlighted that nine of the top ten interactions correspond to anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside with 11\u00ce\u00b2-HS, GFAT, PPARG; delphinidin 3-glucoside with 11\u00ce\u00b2-HS, GFAT, PTP and RTKs; and petunidin 3-glucoside with 11\u00ce\u00b2-HS and PTP. These proteins are involved in mechanisms regulating functions such as inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, glucose and lipid metabolism. In conclusion, this work provides a prediction of the potential molecular mechanism of black bean and blue corn polyphenols, specifically anthocyanins and could constitute new pathways by which compounds exert their antidiabetic benefits."

        "abstract": "The study of trade and conflict has largely focused on dyadic interdependence, or trade within discrete pairs of states. Yet, states may also be indirectly interdependent, by way of trade to third parties. This paper examines the influence of third-party trade on dyadic conflict initiation. I argue that certain structures of trade provide economically invested third parties with (1) an incentive to discourage dyadic conflict between a potential initiator and a potential target, and (2) the means to show disapproval of conflict by sending trade-based signals of resolve. The argument thus emphasizes the ability of third parties to introduce novel ex post information into bargaining dynamics, causing potential aggressors to reconsider their conflict strategies. Empirical analysis shows that, in fact, when a given dyad shares the sort of trade structures that enable costly signaling by third parties, the probability of conflict initiation declines substantially. In contrast, when third-party trade merely increases a potential initiator's opportunity costs for conflict, conflict behavior remains unchanged. \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2013."

Using existing multidisciplinary workgroups established for continuous process improvement in three surgical pathway areas ((colorectal, gynecology, and urologic oncology (cystectomy)), we developed an educational toolkit focused on implementation strategies for multimodal analgesia and non-pharmacologic approaches for managing pain with the goal of reducing opioid exposure in hospitalized patients. We analyzed prospectively collected data from pathway patients before dissemination of the toolkit (July 2016-June 2017; n = 869) and after (July 2017-June 2018; n = 838). We evaluated the association between program implementation and use of oral morphine equivalents (OME), average pain scores, time to first ambulation after surgery, urinary catheter duration, time to solid food after surgery, length of stay, discharge opioid prescriptions, and readmission.ResultsMultivariate regression demonstrated that the program was associated with significant decreases in intraoperative OME (14.5 \u00c2\u00b1 2.4 mEQ (milliequivalents) reduction; p < 0.0001), day before discharge OME (18 \u00c2\u00b1 6.5 mEQ reduction; p < 0.005), day of discharge OME (9.6 \u00c2\u00b1 3.28 mEQ reduction; p < 0.003), and discharge prescription OME (156 \u00c2\u00b1 22\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mEq reduction; p < 0.001). Reduction in OME was associated with earlier resumption of solid food (0.58 \u00c2\u00b1 0.15\u00e2\u20ac\u2030days reduction; p < 0.0002).ConclusionOur multifaceted optimal analgesia program to manage perioperative pain in the hospital was effective and further improved analgesia in the setting of a mature enhanced recovery program."

An intriguing feature of the infection is the minimal disease in most children, a demographic at higher risk for other respiratory viral diseases. To investigate age-dependent effects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we inoculated two rhesus macaque monkey dam-infant pairs with SARS-CoV-2 and conducted virological and transcriptomic analyses of the respiratory tract and evaluated systemic cytokine and Ab responses. Viral RNA levels in all sampled mucosal secretions were comparable across dam-infant pairs in the respiratory tract. Despite comparable viral loads, adult macaques showed higher IL-6 in serum at day 1 postinfection whereas CXCL10 was induced in all animals. Both groups mounted neutralizing Ab responses, with infants showing a more rapid induction at day 7. Transcriptome analysis of tracheal airway cells isolated at day 14 postinfection revealed significant upregulation of multiple IFN-stimulated genes in infants compared with adults. In contrast, a profibrotic transcriptomic signature with genes associated with cilia structure and function, extracellular matrix composition and metabolism, coagulation, angiogenesis, and hypoxia was induced in adults compared with infants. Our study in rhesus macaque monkey dam-infant pairs suggests age-dependent differential airway responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and describes a model that can be used to investigate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis between infants and adults."

        "abstract": "Yttrium-90 (Y-90) transarterial radioembolization uses radioactive microspheres injected into the hepatic artery to irradiate liver tumors internally. One of the major challenges is the lack of reliable dosimetry methods for dose prediction and dose verification. We present a patient-specific dosimetry approach for personalized treatment planning based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the microsphere transport combined with Y-90 physics modeling called CFDose. The ultimate goal is the development of a software to optimize the amount of activity and injection point for optimal tumor targeting. We present the proof-of-concept of a CFD dosimetry tool based on a patient's angiogram performed in standard-of-care planning. The hepatic arterial tree of the patient was segmented from the cone-beam CT (CBCT) to predict the microsphere transport using multiscale CFD modeling. To calculate the dose distribution, the predicted microsphere distribution was convolved with a Y-90 dose point kernel. Vessels as small as 0.45&nbsp;mm were segmented, the&nbsp;microsphere distribution between the liver segments using flow analysis was predicted,&nbsp;the volumetric microsphere and resulting dose distribution in the liver volume were computed. The patient was imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) 2&nbsp;h after radioembolization to evaluate the Y-90 distribution. The dose distribution was found to be consistent with the Y-90 PET images. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a complete framework for personalized Y-90 microsphere simulation and dosimetry using patient-specific input parameters."

However, little is known about early development and symptom onset, information that is critical to guide earlier identification, more accurate prognoses, and improved treatment options. Data from 8 unique studies that used the Mullen Scales of Early Learning to assess children with an FMR1 gene expansion were combined to create a data set of 1178 observations of >500 young children. Linear mixed modeling was used to explore developmental trajectories, symptom onset, and unique developmental profiles of children <5 years of age. Boys with an FMR1 gene full mutation showed delays in early learning, motor skills, and language development as young as 6 months of age, and both sexes with a full mutation were delayed on all developmental domains by their second birthday. Boys with a full mutation continued to gain skills over early childhood at around half the rate of their typically developing peers; girls with a full mutation showed growth at around three-quarters of the rate of their typically developing peers. Although children with a premutation were mostly typical in their developmental profiles and trajectories, mild but significant delays in fine motor skills by 18 months were detected. Children with the FMR1 gene full mutation demonstrate significant developmental challenges within the first 2 years of life, suggesting that earlier identification is needed to facilitate earlier implementation of interventions and therapeutics to maximize effectiveness."

Additionally, our proposed practices are compared to the guidelines from the Foods Program Regulatory Subdivision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and from the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology (ASVCP). The LTC suggestions are closely aligned with those from the OIE and comply with version 2021-01 of the AAVLD Requirements for an Accredited Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, although some LTC recommendations are more stringent and extend beyond the AAVLD requirements. LTC suggested guidelines are substantially different than the guidelines recently published by the U.S. FDA for validation and modification of regulated tests used for detection of pathogens in pet food and animal-derived products, such as dairy. Veterinary diagnostic laboratories that perform assays from the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Method (BAM) manual must be aware of the different standard."

        "abstract": "Evaluation of the diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of tests for infectious diseases in wild animals is challenging, and some of the limitations may affect compliance with the OIE-recommended test validation pathway. We conducted a methodologic review of test validation studies for OIE-listed diseases in wild mammals published between 2008 and 2017 and focused on study design, statistical analysis, and reporting of results. Most published papers addressed Mycobacterium bovis infection in one or more wildlife species. Our review revealed limitations or missing information about sampled animals, identification criteria for positive and negative samples (case definition), representativeness of source and target populations, and species in the study, as well as information identifying animals sampled for calculations of DSe and DSp as naturally infected captive, free-ranging, or experimentally challenged animals. The deficiencies may have reflected omissions in reporting rather than design flaws, although lack of random sampling might have induced bias in estimates of DSe and DSp. We used case studies of validation of tests for hemorrhagic diseases in deer and white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats to demonstrate approaches for validation when new pathogen serotypes or genotypes are detected and diagnostic algorithms are changed, and how purposes of tests evolve together with the evolution of the pathogen after identification. We describe potential benefits of experimental challenge studies for obtaining DSe and DSp estimates, methods to maintain sample integrity, and Bayesian latent class models for statistical analysis. We make recommendations for improvements in future studies of detection test accuracy in wild mammals."

        "abstract": "Scientific communication is facilitated by a data-driven, scientifically sound taxonomy that considers the end-user's needs and established successful practice. In 2013, the Fusarium community voiced near unanimous support for a concept of Fusarium that represented a clade comprising all agriculturally and clinically important Fusarium species, including the F. solani species complex (FSSC). Subsequently, this concept was challenged in 2015 by one research group who proposed dividing the genus Fusarium into seven genera, including the FSSC described as members of the genus Neocosmospora, with subsequent justification in 2018 based on claims that the 2013 concept of Fusarium is polyphyletic. Here, we test this claim and provide a phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous protein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of Fusarium including the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in support of a genus Fusarium that includes the FSSC and several other basal lineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, students, and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In recognition of this monophyly, 40 species described as genus Neocosmospora were recombined in genus Fusarium, and nine others were renamed Fusarium. Here the global Fusarium community voices strong support for the inclusion of the FSSC in Fusarium, as it remains the best scientific, nomenclatural, and practical taxonomic option available."

        "abstract": "Plant populations persist under recurrent fire via resprouting from surviving tissues (resprouters) or seedling recruitment (seeders). Woody species are inherently slow maturing, meaning that seeders are confined to infrequent fire regimes. However, for grasses, which mature faster, the relationships between persistence strategy and fire regime remain unknown. Globally, we analysed associations between fire regimes experienced by hundreds of grass species and their persistence strategy, within a phylogenetic context. We also tested whether persistence strategies are associated with morphological and physiological traits. Resprouters were associated with less frequent fire than seeders. Whilst modal fire frequencies were similar (fire return interval of 4-6&nbsp;yr), seeders were restricted to regions with more frequent fire than resprouters, suggesting that greater competition with long-lived resprouters restricts seeder recruitment and survival when fire is rare. Resprouting was associated with lower leaf N, higher C:N ratios and the presence of belowground buds, but was unrelated to photosynthetic pathway. Differences between the life histories of grasses and woody species led to a contrasting prevalence of seeders and resprouters in relation to fire frequency. Rapid sexual maturation in grasses means that seeder distributions, relative to fire regime, are determined by competitive ability and recruitment, rather than time to reproductive maturity."

        "abstract": "Pierce's disease (PD) in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is caused by the bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa. X. fastidiosa is limited to the xylem tissue and following infection induces extensive plant-derived xylem blockages, primarily in the form of tyloses. Tylose-mediated vessel occlusions are a hallmark of PD, particularly in susceptible V.&nbsp;vinifera. We temporally monitored tylose development over the course of the disease to link symptom severity to the level of tylose occlusion and the presence/absence of the bacterial pathogen at fine-scale resolution. The majority of vessels containing tyloses were devoid of bacterial cells, indicating that direct, localized perception of X.&nbsp;fastidiosa was not a primary cause of tylose formation. In addition, we used X-ray computed microtomography and machine-learning to determine that X.&nbsp;fastidiosa induces significant starch depletion in xylem ray parenchyma cells. This suggests that a signalling mechanism emanating from the vessels colonized by bacteria enables a systemic response to X.&nbsp;fastidiosa infection. To understand the transcriptional changes underlying these phenotypes, we integrated global transcriptomics into the phenotypes we tracked over the disease spectrum. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that considerable transcriptomic reprogramming occurred during early PD before symptom appearance. Specifically, we determined that many genes associated with tylose formation (ethylene signalling and cell wall biogenesis) and drought stress were up-regulated during both Phase I and Phase II of PD. On the contrary, several genes related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were down-regulated during both phases. These responses correlate with significant starch depletion observed in ray cells and tylose synthesis in vessels."

        "abstract": "Neural crest (NC) cells are multipotent embryonic cells that form melanocytes, craniofacial bone and cartilage, and the peripheral nervous system in vertebrates. NC cells express many cadherin proteins, which control their specification, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Abnormal NC development leads to congenital defects including craniofacial clefts as well as NC-derived cancers. Here, we identify the role of the type II cadherin protein, Cadherin-11 (CDH11), in early chicken NC development. CDH11 is known to play a role in NC cell migration in amphibian embryos as well as cell survival, proliferation, and migration in cancer cells. It has also been linked to the complex neurocristopathy disorder, Elsahy-Waters Syndrome, in humans. In this study, we knocked down CDH11 translation at the onset of its expression in the NC domain during NC induction. Loss of CDH11 led to a reduction of bonafide NC cells in the dorsal neural tube combined with defects in cell survival and migration. Loss of CDH11 increased p53-mediated programmed-cell death, and blocking the p53 pathway rescued the NC phenotype. Our findings reveal an early requirement for CDH11 in NC development and demonstrated the complexity of the mechanisms that regulate NC development, where a single cell-cell adhesion protein simultaneous controls multiple essential cellular functions to ensure proper specification, survival, and transition to a migratory phase in the dorsal neural tube. Our findings may also increase our understanding of early cadherin-related NC developmental defects."

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive tumor of the brain, with an average post-diagnosis survival of 15 months. GBM stem cells (GBMSC) resist the standard-of-care therapy, temozolomide, and are considered a major contributor to tumor resistance. Mammalian target of rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell proliferation and has been shown by others to have reduced activity in GBMSC. We recently identified a novel chemical series of human-safe piperazine-based brain-penetrant mTORC1-specific inhibitors. We assayed the piperazine-mTOR binding strength by two biophysical measurements, biolayer interferometry and field-effect biosensing, and these confirmed each other and demonstrated a structure-activity relationship. As mTORC1 is altered in human GBMSC, and as mTORC1 inhibitors have been tested in previous GBM clinical trials, we tested the killing potency of the tightest-binding piperazines and observed that these were potent GBMSC killers. GBMSCs are resistant to the standard-of-care temozolomide therapy, but temozolomide supplemented with tight-binding piperazine meclizine and flunarizine greatly enhanced GBMSC death over temozolomide alone. Lastly, we investigated IDH1-mutated GBMSC mutations that are known to affect mitochondrial and mTORC1 metabolism, and the tight-binding meclizine provoked 'synthetic lethality' in IDH1-mutant GBMSCs. In other words, IDH1-mutated GBMSC showed greater sensitivity to the coadministration of temozolomide and meclizine. These data tend to support a novel clinical strategy for GBM, i.e., the co-administration of meclizine or flunarizine as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of GBM and IDH1-mutant GBM."

        "abstract": "In recent years, zebrafish have become commonly used as a model for studying human traits and disorders. Their small size, high fecundity, and rapid development allow for more high-throughput experiments compared to other vertebrate models. Given that zebrafish share >70% gene homologs with humans and their genomes can be readily edited using highly efficient CRISPR methods, we are now able to rapidly generate mutations impacting practically any gene of interest. Unfortunately, our ability to phenotype mutant larvae has not kept pace. To address this challenge, we have developed a protocol that obtains multiple phenotypic measurements from individual zebrafish larvae in an automated and parallel fashion, including morphological features (i.e., body length, eye area, and head size) and movement/behavior. By assaying wild-type zebrafish in a variety of conditions, we determined optimal parameters that avoid significant developmental defects or physical damage; these include morphological imaging of larvae at two time points [3 days post fertilization (dpf) and 5 dpf] coupled with motion tracking of behavior at 5 dpf. As a proof-of-principle, we tested our approach on two novel CRISPR-generated mutant zebrafish lines carrying predicted null-alleles of syngap1b and slc7a5, orthologs to two human genes implicated in autism-spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. Using our optimized high-throughput phenotyping protocol, we recapitulated previously published results from mouse and zebrafish models of these candidate genes. In summary, we describe a rapid parallel pipeline to characterize morphological and behavioral features of individual larvae in a robust and consistent fashion, thereby improving our ability to better identify genes important in human traits and disorders."

Foundations of mechanistic understanding and well-established preclinical safety efficacy make it a viable candidate.MethodsA randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose trial was conducted. Intravenous allopregnanolone or placebo was administered once-per-week for 12&nbsp;weeks with a 1-month follow-up. Participants with early AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD), a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 20-26 inclusive, and age \u00e2\u2030\u00a555 years were randomized (6:2 to three allopregnanolone dosing cohorts or one placebo cohort). Primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and maximally tolerated dose (MTD). Exploratory endpoints included cognitive and imaging biomarkers.ResultsA total of 24 participants completed the trial. Allopregnanolone was safe and well tolerated in all study participants. No differences were observed between treatment arms in the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AE). Most common AE were mild to moderate in severity and included rash (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 [22%]) and fatigue (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 [17%]). A single non-serious AE, dizziness, was attributable to treatment. There was one serious AE not related to treatment. Pharmacokinetics indicated a predictable linear dose-response in plasma concentration of allopregnanolone after intravenous administration over 30 minutes. The maximum plasma concentrations for the 2&nbsp;mg, 4&nbsp;mg, 6&nbsp;mg, and 10&nbsp;mg dosages were 14.53&nbsp;ng/mL (+/-7.31), 42.05&nbsp;ng/mL (+/-14.55), 60.07&nbsp;ng/mL (+/-12.8), and 137.48&nbsp;ng/mL (+/-38.69), respectively. The MTD was established based on evidence of allopregnanolone-induced mild sedation at the highest doses; a sex difference in the threshold for sedation was observed (males 10 mg; females 14&nbsp;mg). No adverse outcomes on cognition or magnetic resonance imaging-based imaging outcomes were evident.ConclusionsAllopregnanolone was well tolerated and safe across all doses in persons with early AD. Safety, MTD, and PK profiles support advancement of allopregnanolone as a regenerative therapeutic for AD to a phase 2 efficacy trial.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov-NCT02221622."

The primary treatment for HD is surgical intervention with resection of the aganglionic bowel. The accurate identification of the aganglionic segment depends on the histologic evaluation of multiple biopsies to determine the absence of ganglion cells in the tissue, which can be a time-consuming procedure. We investigate the feasibility of using a combination of label-free optical modalities, second harmonic generation (SHG); two-photon excitation autofluorescence (2PAF); and Raman spectroscopy (RS), to accurately locate and identify ganglion cells in murine intestinal tissue without the use of exogenous labels or dyes. We show that the image contrast provided by SHG and 2PAF signals allows for the visualization of the overall tissue morphology and localization of regions that may contain ganglion cells, while RS provides detailed multiplexed molecular information that can be used to accurately identify specific ganglion cells. Support vector machine, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis classification models were applied to the hyperspectral Raman data and showed that ganglion cells can be identified with a classification accuracy higher than 95%. Our findings suggest that a near real-time intraoperative histology method can be developed using these three optical modalities together that can aid pathologists and surgeons in rapid, accurate identification of ganglion cells to guide surgical decisions with minimal human intervention."

        "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal studies and experience sampling methods are becoming more common in psychology. While they provide a unique opportunity to ask novel questions about within-person processes relating to personality, there is a lack of methods specifically built to characterize the interplay between traits and states. We thus introduce a Bayesian multivariate mixed-effects location scale model (M-MELSM). The formulation can simultaneously model both personality traits (the location) and states (the scale) for multivariate data common to personality research. Variables can be included to predict either (or both) the traits and states, in addition to estimating random effects therein. This provides correlations between location and scale random effects, both across and within each outcome, which allows for characterizing relations between any number of personality traits and the corresponding states. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only to make estimation possible, but also because it provides the necessary information for use in psychological applications such as hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model we use data from 194 individuals that provided daily ratings of negative and positive affect, as well as their physical activity in the form of step counts over 100 consecutive days. We describe the fitted model, where we emphasize, with visualization, the richness of information provided by the M-MELSM. We demonstrate Bayesian hypothesis testing for the correlations between the random effects. We conclude by discussing limitations of the MELSM in general and extensions to the M-MELSM specifically for personality research."

Under these circumstances it is important to understand how the effects of chronic conditions evolve over time relative to aging-related and end-of-life changes. The identification of periods in time where multimorbidity impacts particular outcomes such as depressive symptoms, versus periods of time where this is not the case, reduces the complexity of the phenomenon.ObjectiveWe present the Johnson-Neyman (J-N) technique in the context of a curvilinear longitudinal model with higher-order terms to probe moderators and to identify regions of statistical significance. In essence, the J-N technique allows one to identify conditions under which moderators impact an outcome from conditions where these effects are not significant.MethodsTo illustrate the use of the J-N technique in a longitudinal sample, we used data from the Health and Retirement Study. Analyses were based on time-to-death models including participants who died within the study duration of 12 years.ResultsMultimorbidity differentially affects rates of change in depression. For some periods in time the effects are statistically significant while in other periods the same effects are not statistically different from zero.ConclusionThe J-N technique is useful to continuously probe moderating effects and to identify particular interactions with the model for time when certain effects are or are not statistically significant. In the context of multimorbidity this method is particularly useful for interpreting the complex interactions with differential change over time."

Today, surveys of population genomic diversity are revealing extensive loss-of-function and gene content variation, yet the adaptive significance of much of this variation remains unknown. Here we examine the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive loss of function through the lens of population genomics and consider the challenges and opportunities of studying adaptive loss-of-function alleles using population genetics models. We discuss how the theoretically expected existence of allelic heterogeneity, defined as multiple functionally analogous mutations at the same locus, has proven consistent with empirical evidence and why this impedes both the detection of selection and causal relationships with phenotypes. We then review technical progress towards new functionally explicit population genomic tools and genotype-phenotype methods to overcome these limitations. More broadly, we discuss how the challenges of studying adaptive loss of function highlight the value of classifying genomic variation in a way consistent with the functional concept of an allele from classical population genetics."

For the detection of MCP fragment, STAR had a larger area under the ROC curve (0.93) compared with SNAR (0.74, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.015) and CT (0.54, P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u2030.001). Still images of TAR and SNAR had comparable concordance for cartilage score (0.80 and 0.77, respectively) and medial compartment pathology (0.80 and 0.73, respectively).ConclusionStill images of NAR, STAR, and CT had similar diagnostic value to identify MCP fissures. Still images of TAR was superior to SNAR and CT to identify MCP fragments.Clinical significanceThe diagnostic accuracy of SNAR varied on the basis of the coronoid lesion being evaluated."

Differences in proportions or medians between \"union,\" \"delayed union\" and \"non-union\" were tested using \u00cf\u20212 and Mann-Whitney U-tests for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Potential explanatory variables for \"delayed or non-union\" were tested using logistic regression to identify risk factors.ResultsMedian radiographic follow up was 53\u00e2\u20ac\u2030days (14-282). Delayed union occurred in 13.9% of fractures (64/461), non-union in 4.6% (21/461), and mal-union in 0.7% (3/461). Risk factors for delayed or non-union were age (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.12-1.31); comminuted fracture (OR 4.24, 95% CI 2.4-7.5); treatment with bone graft (all types) (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.3-8.5); surgical site infection (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.17-8.97), and major implant failure (OR 12.94, 95% CI 5.06-33.1).ConclusionOlder dogs, dogs with comminuted fractures, surgical site infection, or major implant failure were at increased odds of delayed or non-union. Radius and ulna fractures in toy breed dogs were not at increased odds of delayed or non-union.Clinical significanceThe identified risk factors should inform fracture planning and prognosticating. The prognosis for radial fractures in toy breeds appears better than historically believed."

        "title": "Mouse Preclinical Cancer Immunotherapy Modeling Involving Anti-PD-1 Therapies Reveals the Need to Use Mouse Reagents to Mirror Clinical Paradigms",
        "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has emerged as one of the most powerful tools to reverse cancer induced immune suppression. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-1/PD-L1) are FDA-approved and their clinical use is rapidly expanding. As opposed to the clinical paradigm, which can result in significant responses and toxicities, it has been difficult to reproduce these effects preclinically using mouse models. In large part, this is due to models, which employ rapidly growing ex vivo cultured transplantable tumor cell lines engrafted into young na\u00c3\u00afve inbred laboratory mice. However, another issue concerns the use and repeated application of xenogeneic reagents in mice (i.e., rat or hamster mAbs directed against mouse antigens at variance with clinical use of human or humanized mAbs). Building on our previous studies demonstrating that repeated administration of commonly used xenogeneic anti-PD-1 mAbs derived from both rat and hamster can induce fatal hypersensitivity in some tumor-bearing mice, we sought to compare these result with the effects of a mouse anti-mouse PD-1 mAb. Application of a murine anti-mouse PD-1 (clone: MuDX400) did not result in lethal anaphylaxis in the 4T1 tumor model. It also displayed superior antitumor effects in this and other tumor models, as it did not induce neutralizing antibody responses against the anti-PD-1 mAb, such as were observed when using xenogeneic anti-PD1 mAbs. These results demonstrate that more accurate preclinical modeling necessitates the use of mouse reagents mirroring the clinical scenario to ascertain long-term effects or toxicities, while avoiding xenogeneic responses, which do not occur clinically. Furthermore, these studies suggest a direct mechanism, whereby preclinical murine studies have often failed to recapitulate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of single agent checkpoint inhibition."

        "abstract": "BackgroundChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used for industrial production of biopharmaceuticals. Many genetic, chemical, and environmental approaches have been developed to modulate cellular pathways to improve titers. However, these methods are often irreversible or have off-target effects. Development of techniques which are precise, tunable, and reversible will facilitate temporal regulation of target pathways to maximize titers. In this study, we investigate the use of optogenetics in CHO cells. The light-activated CRISPR-dCas9 effector (LACE) system was first transiently transfected to express eGFP in a light-inducible manner. Then, a stable system was tested using lentiviral transduction.ResultsTransient transfections resulted in increasing eGFP expression as a function of LED intensity, and activation for 48\u00e2\u20ac\u2030h yielded up to 4-fold increased eGFP expression compared to cells kept in the dark. Fluorescence decreased once the LACE system was deactivated, and a protein half-life of 14.9\u00e2\u20ac\u2030h was calculated, which is in agreement with values reported in the literature. In cells stably expressing the LACE system, eGFP expression was confirmed, but there was no significant increase in expression following light activation.ConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest that optogenetics can regulate CHO cell cultures, but development of stable cell lines requires optimized expression levels of the LACE components to maintain high dynamic range."

        "abstract": "Infectious diseases, also known as transmissible or communicable diseases, are caused by pathogens or parasites that spread in communities by direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated materials, through droplets and aerosols, or via vectors such as insects. Such diseases cause \u00cb\u015317% of all human deaths and their management and control places an immense burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Traditional approaches for the prevention and control of infectious diseases include vaccination programmes, hygiene measures and drugs that suppress the pathogen, treat the disease symptoms or attenuate aggressive reactions of the host immune system. The provision of vaccines and biologic drugs such as antibodies is hampered by the high cost and limited scalability of traditional manufacturing platforms based on microbial and animal cells, particularly in developing countries where infectious diseases are prevalent and poorly controlled. Molecular farming, which uses plants for protein expression, is a promising strategy to address the drawbacks of current manufacturing platforms. In this review article, we consider the potential of molecular farming to address healthcare demands for the most prevalent and important epidemic and pandemic diseases, focussing on recent outbreaks of high-mortality coronavirus infections and diseases that disproportionately affect the developing world."

The study's primary outcome was growth failure at hospital discharge, defined as a weight or length z score decrease >0.8 from birth. Regression analysis was performed to assess changes in z scores over time.ResultsAmong 125 infants with gastroschisis, the median gestational age was 37&nbsp;weeks (IQR 35-37). Length of stay was 32&nbsp;days (23-60); 55% developed weight or length growth failure at discharge (28% had weight growth failure, 42% had length growth failure, and 15% had both weight and length growth failure). Weight and length z scores at 14&nbsp;days, 30&nbsp;days, and discharge were less than birth (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;.01 for all). Weight and length z scores declined from birth to 30&nbsp;days (-0.10 and -0.11 z score units/week, respectively, P&nbsp;<&nbsp;.001). Length growth failure at discharge was associated with weight and length z score changes over time (P&nbsp;<&nbsp;.05 for both). Lower gestational age was associated with weight growth failure (OR 0.70 for each gestational age week, 95% CI 0.55-0.89, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.004).ConclusionsGrowth failure, in particular linear growth failure, is common in infants with gastroschisis.

The right hepatic artery (RHA) was segmented from contrast-enhanced cone-beam computed tomography scans. The blood flow was investigated in the trunk of the RHA using numerical simulations for 6 injection position scenarios at 2 sites located at a distance of approximately 5 and 20 mm upstream of the first bifurcation (RHA diameters of approximately 4.6 mm). The 90Y delivery to downstream vessels was calculated from the simulated hepatic artery hemodynamics.ResultsVarying the injection location along the RHA and across the vessel cross-section resulted in different simulated microsphere distributions in the downstream vascular bed. When the catheter tip was 5 mm upstream of the bifurcation, 90Y distribution in the downstream branches varied by as much as 53% with a 1.5-mm radial movement of the tip. However, the catheter radial movement had a weaker effect on the microsphere distribution when the injection plane was farther from the first bifurcation (20 mm), with a maximum delivery variation of 9% to a downstream branch.ConclusionsAn injection location far from bifurcations is recommended to minimize the effect of radial movements of the catheter tip on the microsphere distribution."

Repeated early-life exposures to diarrheal pathogens can result in comorbidities including stunted growth and cognitive deficits, suggesting an impairment in the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Neonatal C57BL/6 mice were infected with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (strain e2348/69; \u00ce\u201descV [type III secretion system {T3SS} mutant]) or the vehicle (Luria-Bertani [LB] broth) via orogastric gavage at postnatal day 7 (P7). Behavior (novel-object recognition [NOR] task, light/dark [L/D] box, and open-field test [OFT]), intestinal physiology (Ussing chambers), and the gut microbiota (16S Illumina sequencing) were assessed in adulthood (6 to 8\u00e2\u20ac\u2030weeks of age). Neonatal infection of mice with EPEC, but not the T3SS mutant, caused ileal inflammation in neonates and impaired recognition memory (NOR task) in adulthood. Cognitive impairments were coupled with increased neurogenesis (Ki67 and doublecortin immunostaining) and neuroinflammation (increased microglia activation [Iba1]) in adulthood. Intestinal pathophysiology in adult mice was characterized by increased secretory state (short-circuit current [Isc]) and permeability (conductance) (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-dextran flux) in the ileum and colon of neonatally EPEC-infected mice, along with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Tnf\u00ce\u00b1, Il12, and Il6) and pattern recognition receptors (Nod1/2 and Tlr2/4). Finally, neonatal EPEC infection caused significant dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, including decreased Firmicutes, in adulthood. Together, these findings demonstrate that infection in early life can significantly impair the MGB axis in adulthood."

Unraveling how the reactive versus tolerogenic state is controlled might point toward novel therapeutic strategies to treat autoimmune diseases. The surface receptor Toso/Faim3 has been linked to apoptosis, IgM binding, and innate immune responses. In this study, we used Toso-deficient mice to investigate the importance of Toso in tolerance and autoimmunity. We found that Toso(-/-) mice do not develop severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. Toso(-/-) dendritic cells were less sensitive to Toll-like receptor stimulation and induced significantly lower levels of disease-associated inflammatory T-cell responses. Consistent with this observation, the transfer of Toso(-/-) dendritic cells did not induce autoimmune diabetes, indicating their tolerogenic potential. In Toso(-/-) mice subjected to EAE induction, we found increased numbers of regulatory T cells and decreased encephalitogenic cellular infiltrates in the brain. Finally, inhibition of Toso activity in vivo at either an early or late stage of EAE induction prevented further disease progression. Taken together, our data identify Toso as a unique regulator of inflammatory autoimmune responses and an attractive target for therapeutic intervention."

We sought to evaluate the impact of procedural cryoablation of the PNN on quality of life (QOL) in patients with AR and NAR.MethodsAdult patients undergoing PNN cryoablation for AR or NAR after appropriate medical therapy were included for analysis. Demographics, medical therapies, baseline rhinitis symptom (total nasal symptom score [TNSS]), and disease-specific QOL (mini-rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire [mini-RQLQ]) were recorded. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for significant changes in baseline test scores posttreatment. Absolute and relative improvement in outcomes was determined for each participant. Secondary outcomes were assessed with univariate and multivariate analyses.ResultsFourteen patients were enrolled with a mean follow-up of 16.5 weeks.

The minimal clinically important difference for the TNSS and mini-RQLQ was obtained in 92.9% of patients in each category. Relative mean percentage (%) improvement after PNN cryoablation in the TNSS and mini-RQLQ was 40.7% and 40.5% (standard deviation = 24.9 and 29.5, respectively), respectively, for all patients. Patients with NAR (n = 10) reported mean improvement of 41.3% (29.1) as measured by the TNSS and 49.6% (25.9) by mini-RQLQ. Patients with AR reported mean percentage improvement in TNSS and mini-RQLQ scores of 39.5% (12.1) and 24.6% (28.5), respectively. Patients who had been prescribed a nasal anticholinergic for management prior to PNN cryoablation had statistically significantly increased improvement in mini-RQLQ scores from pre- to post-procedure (P = .0387).ConclusionSurgical cryoablation of the PNN significantly improves both symptoms and disease-specific QOL in majority of patients with AR and NAR."

Therefore, we aimed to identify factors associated with mortality in trauma patients receiving UMT in the modern resuscitation era.MethodsAn Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma multicenter retrospective study of 461 trauma patients from 17 trauma centers who received \u00e2\u2030\u00a520 U of RBCs in 24 hours was performed (2014-2019). Multivariable logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree analysis were used to identify clinical characteristics associated with mortality.ResultsThe 461 patients were young (median age, 35 years), male (82%), severely injured (median Injury Severity Score, 33), in shock (median shock index, 1.2; base excess, -9), and transfused a median of 29 U of RBCs, 22 U of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 24 U of platelets (PLT). Mortality was 46% at 24 hours and 65% at discharge. Transfusion of RBC/FFP \u00e2\u2030\u00a51.5:1 or RBC/PLT \u00e2\u2030\u00a51.5:1 was significantly associated with mortality, most pronounced for the 18% of patients who received both RBC/PLT and RBC/FFP \u00e2\u2030\u00a51.5:1 (odds ratios, 3.11 and 2.81 for mortality at 24 hours and discharge; both p < 0.01). Classification and Regression Tree identified that age older than 50 years, low initial Glasgow Coma Scale, thrombocytopenia, and resuscitative thoracotomy were associated with low likelihood of survival (14-26%), while absence of these factors was associated with the highest survival (71%).ConclusionDespite modern massive transfusion protocols, one half of trauma patients receiving UMT are transfused with either RBC/FFP or RBC/PLT in unbalanced ratios \u00e2\u2030\u00a51.5:1, with increased associated mortality. Maintaining focus on balanced ratios during UMT is critical, and consideration of advanced age, poor initial mental status, thrombocytopenia, and resuscitative thoracotomy can aid in prognostication.Level of evidencePrognostic, level III."

        "abstract": "The use of digital technology is increasing rapidly across surgical specialities, yet there is no consensus for the term 'digital surgery'. This is critical as digital health technologies present technical, governance, and legal challenges which are unique to the surgeon and surgical patient. We aim to define the term digital surgery and the ethical issues surrounding its clinical application, and to identify barriers and research goals for future practice. 38 international experts, across the fields of surgery, AI, industry, law, ethics and policy, participated in a four-round Delphi exercise. Issues were generated by an expert panel and public panel through a scoping questionnaire around key themes identified from the literature and voted upon in two subsequent questionnaire rounds. Consensus was defined if >70% of the panel deemed the statement important and <30% unimportant. A final online meeting was held to discuss consensus statements. The definition of digital surgery as the use of technology for the enhancement of preoperative planning, surgical performance, therapeutic support, or training, to improve outcomes and reduce harm achieved 100% consensus agreement. We highlight key ethical issues concerning data, privacy, confidentiality and public trust, consent, law, litigation and liability, and commercial partnerships within digital surgery and identify barriers and research goals for future practice. Developers and users of digital surgery must not only have an awareness of the ethical issues surrounding digital applications in healthcare, but also the ethical considerations unique to digital surgery. Future research into these issues must involve all digital surgery stakeholders including patients."

        "title": "Relationship Between Cerebrovascular Reactivity and Cognition Among People With Risk of Cognitive Decline.",
        "abstract": "Vascular risk factors (e.g., obesity and hypertension) are associated with cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, and dementia. Reduced perfusion may reflect the impaired ability of blood vessels to regulate blood flow in reaction to varying circumstances such as hypercapnia (increased end-tidal partial pressures of CO2). It has been shown that cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) measured with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI is correlated with cognitive performance and alterations of CVR may be an indicator of vascular disfunction leading to cognitive decline. However, the underlying mechanism of CVR alterations in BOLD signal may not be straight-forward because BOLD signal is affected by multiple physiological parameters, such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume, and oxygen metabolism. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI quantitatively measures blood flow in the brain providing images of local CBF. Therefore, in this study, we measured CBF and its changes using a dynamic ASL technique during a hypercapnia challenge and tested if CBF or CVR was related to cognitive performance using the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. Seventy-eight participants underwent cognitive testing and MRI including ASL during a hypercapnia challenge with a RespirAct computer-controlled gas blender, targeting 10 mmHg higher end-tidal CO2 level than the baseline while end-tidal O2 level was maintained. Pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) was collected during a 2-min baseline and a 2-min hypercapnic period. CVR was obtained by calculating a percent change of CBF per the end-tidal CO2 elevation in mmHg between the baseline and the hypercapnic challenge. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that baseline resting CBF has no significant relationship with MMSE, while lower CVR in the whole brain gray matter (\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.689, p = 0.005) and white matter (\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.578, p = 0.016) are related to lower MMSE score. In addition, region of interest (ROI) based analysis showed positive relationships between MMSE score and CVR in 26 out of 122 gray matter ROIs."

        "abstract": "BackgroundFederal exception from informed consent (EFIC) procedures allow studies to enroll patients with time-sensitive, life-threatening conditions when written consent is not feasible. Our objective was to compare enrollment rates with and without EFIC in a trial of tranexamic acid (TXA) for children with hemorrhagic injuries.MethodsWe conducted a four-center randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial evaluating TXA in children with severe hemorrhagic brain and/or torso injuries. We initiated the trial enrolling patients without EFIC. After 3&nbsp;months of enrollment, we met our a priori futility threshold and paused the trial to incorporate EFIC procedures and obtain regulatory approval. We then restarted the trial allowing EFIC if the guardian was unable to provide timely written consent. We used descriptive statistics to compare characteristics of eligible patients approached with and without EFIC procedures. We also calculated the time delay to restart the trial using EFIC.ResultsWe enrolled one of 15 (6.7%) eligible patients (0.17 per site per month) prior to using EFIC procedures. Of the 14 missed eligible patients, seven (50%) were not enrolled because guardians were not present or were injured and unable to provide written consent. After obtaining approval for EFIC, we enrolled 30 of 48 (62.5%) eligible patients (1.34 per site per month). Of these 30 patients, 22 (73.3%) were enrolled with EFIC. Of the 22, no guardians refused written consent after randomization. There were no significant differences in the eligibility rate and patient characteristics enrolled with and without EFIC procedures. Across all sites, the mean delay to restart the trial using EFIC procedures was 12&nbsp;months.ConclusionsIn a multicenter trial of severely injured children, the use of EFIC procedures greatly increased the enrollment rate and was well accepted by guardians. Initiating the trial without EFIC procedures led to a significant delay in enrollment."

        "abstract": "The 7th edition of the Textbook of Neonatal Resuscitation recommends administration of epinephrine via an umbilical venous catheter (UVC) inserted 2-4 cm below the skin, followed by a 0.5-mL to 1-mL flush for severe bradycardia despite effective ventilation and chest compressions (CC). This volume of flush may not be adequate to push epinephrine to the right atrium in the absence of intrinsic cardiac activity during CC. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of 1-mL and 2.5-mL flush volumes after UVC epinephrine administration on the incidence and time to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in a near-term ovine model of perinatal asphyxia induced cardiac arrest. After 5 min of asystole, lambs were resuscitated per Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines. During resuscitation, lambs received epinephrine through a UVC followed by 1-mL or 2.5-mL normal saline flush. Hemodynamics and plasma epinephrine concentrations were monitored. Three out of seven (43%) and 12/15 (80%) lambs achieved ROSC after the first dose of epinephrine with 1-mL and 2.5-mL flush respectively (p = 0.08). Median time to ROSC and cumulative epinephrine dose required were not different. Plasma epinephrine concentrations at 1 min after epinephrine administration were not different. From our pilot study, higher flush volume after first dose of epinephrine may be of benefit during neonatal resuscitation. More translational and clinical trials are needed."

Here we describe structure-function relationships of highly water-soluble gold nanoparticles comprised of an \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc1.5-5 nm diameter metal core coated by an amphiphilic organic ligand shell, which exhibit membrane embedding and fusion activity mediated by the surface ligands. Using an environment-sensitive dye anchored within the ligand shell as a sensor of membrane embedding, we demonstrate that particles with core sizes of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc2-3 nm are capable of embedding within and penetrating fluid bilayers. At the nanoscale, these particles also promote spontaneous fusion of liposomes or spontaneously embed within intact liposomal vesicles. These studies provide nanoparticle design and selection principles that could be used in drug delivery applications, as membrane stains, or for the creation of novel organic/inorganic nanomaterial self-assemblies."

        "abstract": "Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful tool for vibrational spectroscopy, providing orders of magnitude increase in chemical sensitivity compared to spontaneous Raman scattering. Yet it remains a challenge to synthesize robust, uniform SERS substrates quickly and easily. Lithographic approaches to produce substrates can achieve high, uniform sensitivity but are expensive and complex, thus difficult to scale. Facile solution-phase chemical approaches often result in unreliable SERS substrates due to heterogeneous arrangement of \"hot spots\" throughout the material. Here we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of a homogeneous gold nanofoam (AuNF) substrate produced by a rapid, one-pot, four-ingredient synthetic approach. AuNFs are rapidly nucleated with macroscale porosity and then chemically roughened to produce nanoscale features that confer homogeneous and high signal enhancement (~109) across large areas, a comparable performance to lithographically produced substrates."

While all known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are speculated to have originated in animals, very little is known about their evolutionary history and factors that enable some CoVs to co-exist with humans as low pathogenic and endemic infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1), while others, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have evolved to cause severe disease. In this review, we highlight the origins of all known HCoVs and map positively selected for mutations within HCoV proteins to discuss the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we discuss emerging mutations within SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOC), along with highlighting the demonstrated or speculated impact of these mutations on virus transmission, pathogenicity, and neutralization by natural or vaccine-mediated immunity."

In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body\r\nlocalized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals\r\nof motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in\r\nthese systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local\r\nintegrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a\r\nlocal particle number or a spin flip operator), evolved with the system's\r\nHamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such\r\noperators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL\r\nsystem to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents\r\na density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes\r\nhow this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely\r\ndefined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for\r\ncharacterizing the properties of the MBL phase, both in experiments and\r\nnumerical simulations. We demonstrate the latter by numerically constructing an\r\nextensive set of LIOMs in the MBL phase of a disordered spin chain model.

Genomic prediction addresses this by incorporating all genetic data in a mixed model framework. The primary method for predicting breeding values is genomic best linear unbiased prediction, which uses the realized genomic relationship or kinship matrix (K) to connect genotype to phenotype. Genomic relationship matrices share information among entries to estimate the observed entries' genetic values and predict unobserved entries' genetic values. One of the main parameters of such models is genomic variance (\u00cf\u0192g2), or the variance of a trait associated with a genome-wide sample of DNA polymorphisms, and genomic heritability (hg2); however, the seminal papers introducing different forms of K often do not discuss their effects on the model estimated variance components despite their importance in genetic research and breeding. Here, we discuss the effect of several standard methods for calculating the genomic relationship matrix on estimates of \u00cf\u0192g2 and hg2. With current approaches, we found that the genomic variance tends to be either overestimated or underestimated depending on the scaling and centering applied to the marker matrix (Z), the value of the average diagonal element of K, and the assortment of alleles and heterozygosity (H) in the observed population. Using the average semivariance, we propose a new matrix, KASV, that directly yields accurate estimates of \u00cf\u0192g2 and hg2 in the observed population and produces best linear unbiased predictors equivalent to routine methods in plants and animals."

We hypothesized that MRI is low yield following a normal physical examination and normal CT after a ground-level fall.&nbsp; \r\n      Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients 65 years and older evaluated with a cervical spine MRI following a ground-level fall. Inclusion criteria included age 65 years and older, ground-level fall, normal cervical spine CT followed by a cervical spine MRI. We abstracted data following accepted methodologic guidelines. Patients with any focal neurological finding were considered to have an abnormal neurological examination. Imaging studies were considered to be abnormal if there was a report of an acute traumatic injury. The primary outcome was a traumatic abnormality identified on MRI. We described data with simple descriptive statistics.&nbsp;\r\n      Results: Eighty-seven patients with a median age of 74 (interquartile range [IQR] 69, 83]) years had an MRI following a normal cervical spine CT. Median emergency department length of stay was 8.2 hours (IQR 5.3, 13.5). Sixty-four (73.6%) patients had a normal neurological examination on arrival; eight of these patients (12.5% (95% confidenced interval [CI], 5.6-23.2%) had an abnormal cervical spine MRI. Twenty-three patients (26.4%) had an abnormal neurological examination on arrival; two of these patients (8.7%, 95% CI, 1.1-28%) had an abnormal cervical spine MRI. Overall, 10 patients (11.5%) had an abnormal cervical spine MRI. One patient underwent operative intervention due to an unstable injury. Of the remaining nine patients with acute findings on cervical spine MRI, there were no other unstable injuries; two patients were managed with cervical orthosis, and seven patients had no additional management.&nbsp;\r\n      Conclusion: In this study of older patients with ground-level falls and normal, atraumatic, cervical spine CT, a small portion had traumatic abnormalities on MRI, with few requiring further intervention. Further study is required to identify criteria to determine when MRI should be performed in older patients after a ground-level fall.&nbsp;"

Fracture patterns are variable, but U-type and H-type fractures are common and often present with kyphotic deformity along with translational displacement and impaction. The ideal method of fixation has not been established for these injuries. The goals of treatment include restoration of alignment, stability, and neural decompression as needed. Traditional methods of lumbopelvic fixation have spanned the upper sacral fracture site. Our novel modified method of lumbopelvic fixation directly instruments the S1 body. This allows for direct manipulation of the fracture which we theorize improves reduction and increases stability across the fracture. This article characterizes the injury patterns, outlines the modified technique, and reports the clinical and radiographic outcomes of our modified lumbopelvic fixation technique and construct."

        "abstract": "Many studies project that climate change is expected to cause a significant number of excess deaths. Yet, in integrated assessment models that determine the social cost of carbon (SCC), human mortality impacts do not reflect the latest scientific understanding. We address this issue by estimating country-level mortality damage functions for temperature-related mortality with global spatial coverage. We rely on projections from the most comprehensive published study in the epidemiology literature of future temperature impacts on mortality (Gasparrini et al. in Lancet Planet Health 1:e360-e367, 2017), which estimated changes in heat- and cold-related mortality for 23 countries over the twenty-first century. We model variation in these mortality projections as a function of baseline climate, future temperature change, and income variables and then project future changes in mortality for every country. We find significant spatial heterogeneity in projected mortality impacts, with hotter and poorer places more adversely affected than colder and richer places. In the absence of income-based adaptation, the global mortality rate in 2080-2099 is expected to increase by 1.8% [95% CI 0.8-2.8%] under a lower-emissions RCP 4.5 scenario and by 6.2% [95% CI 2.5-10.0%] in the very high-emissions RCP 8.5 scenario relative to 2001-2020. When the reduced sensitivity to heat associated with rising incomes, such as greater ability to invest in air conditioning, is accounted for, the expected end-of-century increase in the global mortality rate is 1.1% [95% CI 0.4-1.9%] in RCP 4.5 and 4.2% [95% CI 1.8-6.7%] in RCP 8.5. In addition, we compare recent estimates of climate-change induced excess mortality from diarrheal disease, malaria and dengue fever in 2030 and 2050 with current estimates used in SCC calculations and show these are likely underestimated in current SCC estimates, but are also small compared to more direct temperature effects."

        "abstract": "BackgroundBiliary atresia (BA) is a human infant disease with inflammatory fibrous obstructions in the bile ducts and is the most common cause for pediatric liver transplantation. In contrast, the sea lamprey undergoes developmental BA with transient cholestasis and fibrosis during metamorphosis, but emerges as a fecund adult. Therefore, sea lamprey liver metamorphosis may serve as an etiological model for human BA and provide pivotal information for hepatobiliary transformation and possible therapeutics.ResultsWe hypothesized that liver metamorphosis in sea lamprey is due to transcriptional reprogramming that dictates cellular remodeling during metamorphosis. We determined global gene expressions in liver at several metamorphic landmark stages by integrating mRNA-Seq and gene ontology analyses, and validated the results with real-time quantitative PCR, histological and immunohistochemical staining. These analyses revealed that gene expressions of protein folding chaperones, membrane transporters and extracellular matrices were altered and shifted during liver metamorphosis. HSP90, important in protein folding and invertebrate metamorphosis, was identified as a candidate key factor during liver metamorphosis in sea lamprey. Blocking HSP90 with geldanamycin facilitated liver metamorphosis and decreased the gene expressions of the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCoA reductase (hmgcr), and bile acid biosynthesis, cyp7a1. Injection of hsp90 siRNA for 4 days altered gene expressions of met, hmgcr, cyp27a1, and slc10a1. Bile acid concentrations were increased while bile duct and gall bladder degeneration was facilitated and synchronized after hsp90 siRNA injection.ConclusionsHSP90 appears to play crucial roles in hepatobiliary transformation during sea lamprey metamorphosis. Sea lamprey is a useful animal model to study postembryonic development and mechanisms for hsp90-induced hepatobiliary transformation."

        "abstract": "In the coming decades, maintaining a steady food supply for the increasing world population will require high-yielding crop plants which can be productive under increasingly variable conditions. Maintaining high yields will require the successful and uniform establishment of plants in the field under altered environmental conditions. Seed vigor, a complex agronomic trait that includes seed longevity, germination speed, seedling growth, and early stress tolerance, determines the duration and success of this establishment period. Elevated temperature during early seed development can decrease seed size, number, and fertility, delay germination and reduce seed vigor in crops such as cereals, legumes, and vegetable crops. Heat stress in mature seeds can reduce seed vigor in crops such as lettuce, oat, and chickpea. Warming trends and increasing temperature variability can increase seed dormancy and reduce germination rates, especially in crops that require lower temperatures for germination and seedling establishment. To improve seed germination speed and success, much research has focused on selecting quality seeds for replanting, priming seeds before sowing, and breeding varieties with improved seed performance. Recent strides in understanding the genetic basis of variation in seed vigor have used genomics and transcriptomics to identify candidate genes for improving germination, and several studies have explored the potential impact of climate change on the percentage and timing of germination. In this review, we discuss these recent advances in the genetic underpinnings of seed performance as well as how climate change is expected to affect vigor in current varieties of staple, vegetable, and other crops."

We reviewed all charts to extract medical and gynecologic history, blood disorder diagnosis, hormonal treatment prior to and following initial consultation, subsequent visits to the integrated clinic, and hormonal treatment up to 24 months after initial consultation.ResultsWe saw 47 patients; their most common blood disorder diagnosis was protein defect (14 of 47, 30%). Most patients (30 of 47, 64%) were not using any hormonal treatment prior to their initial consultation. After the initial consultation, 26 (55%) elected to start, change, or discontinue hormonal treatment for abnormal menstrual bleeding, the most common treatment being combined hormonal contraception (CHC, 22 of 47, 47%), alone or as dual therapy. Over the study duration, 36 patients (77%) initiated, changed, or discontinued their hormone treatment, 22 (61%) of whom changed their treatment plan more than once. CHC usage decreased from 19 of 47 (40%) to 8 of 37 (22%) and hormonal device usage, particularly the implant, increased from 9 of 47 (19%) to 11 of 37 (30%) over the 24 months from initial consultation.ConclusionMost patients in an integrated complex family planning-pediatric hematology oncology clinic will change their menstrual bleeding hormone treatment with initial consultation, although management may require multiple changes. The most common treatment 24 months following the initial consultation was hormonal devices.ImplicationsPatients with blood disorders affecting menstrual bleeding have complex needs that could be addressed by an integrated complex family planning-pediatric hematology oncology clinic. Most patients require multiple changes in treatment to achieve adequate control of their bleeding, and patients were more likely to choose hormonal devices for management over time."

Here, we reveal that co-enhancement of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes (CPT1A, CPT2 and ACAD9) and immune checkpoint CD47 is dominant in recurrent GBM patients with poor prognosis. A glycolysis-to-FAO metabolic rewiring is associated with CD47 anti-phagocytosis in radioresistant GBM cells and regrown GBM after radiation in syngeneic mice. Inhibition of FAO by CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir or CRISPR-generated CPT1A-/-, CPT2-/-, ACAD9-/- cells demonstrate that FAO-derived acetyl-CoA upregulates CD47 transcription via NF-\u00ce\u00baB/RelA acetylation. Blocking FAO impairs tumor growth and reduces CD47 anti-phagocytosis. Etomoxir combined with anti-CD47 antibody synergizes radiation control of regrown tumors with boosted macrophage phagocytosis. These results demonstrate that enhanced fat acid metabolism promotes aggressive growth of GBM with CD47-mediated immune evasion. The FAO-CD47 axis may be targeted to improve GBM control by eliminating the radioresistant phagocytosis-proofing tumor cells in GBM radioimmunotherapy."

        "abstract": "Background Assessing the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) during hypertension treatment is important for understanding the benefit-harm trade-offs of lower blood pressure goals. It is unknown whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) provide information about SAEs. Methods and Results In SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were measured at baseline in 8828 (94.3%) and 8836 (94.4%) participants, respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP associations with a composite of SPRINT's SAEs of interest: hypotension, syncope, bradycardia, acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, and injurious falls. Elevations in hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were associated with increased composite SAE risk (hazard ratio [HR] per 2-fold higher hs-cTnT: 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06\u00e2\u20ac\u20191.25; HR per 2-fold higher NT-proBNP: 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05\u00e2\u20ac\u20191.14). Compared with both hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP in the lower tertiles, both biomarkers in the highest tertile was associated with increased composite SAE risk (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.32\u00e2\u20ac\u20191.84). Composite SAE risk was higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group for participants with both biomarkers in the lower tertiles, but similar between treatment groups for participants with both biomarkers in the highest tertile (P for interaction=0.008). Conclusions Elevations in hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP individually and in combination are associated with higher composite SAE risk in SPRINT. The differential impact of blood pressure treatment on SAE risk across combined biomarker categories may have implications for identifying individuals with more favorable benefit-harm profiles for intensive blood pressure lowering."

METHODS:A retrospective cohort study was performed for patients undergoing salvage laryngectomy with clinically and radiographically negative neck disease between 1998 and 2015 (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030210). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. RESULTS:PTND was performed on 77/210 patients (36%). The PTND cohort had a greater proportion of advanced T classification (rT3/rT4) tumors (78%) than subjects without PTND (55%; p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001). There was a 14% rate of occult nodal metastases in the paratracheal basin; of these, 55% did not have pathologic lateral neck disease. Multivariate analysis controlling for tumor site, tumor stage, and pathologic lateral neck disease demonstrated that PTND was associated with improved overall survival [OS] (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.03; hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.96), disease-free survival [DFS] (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.03; HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.96), and distant DFS survival (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.01; HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11-0.77). The rate of hypocalcemia did not differ between subjects who underwent bilateral PTND, unilateral PTND, or no PTND (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.19 at discharge, p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.17 at last follow-up). CONCLUSIONS:PTND at the time of salvage laryngectomy was more common in patients with rT3/rT4 tumors and was associated with improved OS and DFS, with no effect on hypocalcemia. In patients undergoing PTND, the finding of occult paratracheal metastases was often independent of lateral neck metastases."

We performed whole-exome genetic sequencing and copy-number variation (CNV) analysis of tumor and normal DNA extracted from flash-frozen, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples.ResultsA total of 93 high-confidence, nonsynonymous somatic mutation events were identified in sinonasal SCC, including loss-of-function mutations in TP53, MAML3, a transcriptional coactivator of the Notch pathway, and GAS6, an activating ligand of the TAM family of tyrosine kinase receptors. Focal amplifications of chromosomal regions 6p25-11.1, containing SOX4 and VEGFA, and 14q32.1-32.3, containing AKT1 and the Notch inhibitory ligand DLK1, were also seen. Further CNV analysis revealed deletions in the critical cell cycle regulators CDKN2A, RB1, RBL1, and RBL2 and the chromatin modifier EP300.ConclusionsSmall cell carcinoma may rarely arise from sinonasal Schneiderian carcinoma in situ and exhibits similar genomic aberrations (eg, SOX amplification, Notch pathway inactivation) to pulmonary small cell carcinoma."

        "abstract": "Microparticles or microvesicles (MPs/MVs) are sub-cellular vesicles with a growing number of known biological functions. Microvesicles from a variety of parent cells within the vascular system increase in numerous pathological states. Red blood cell-derived MVs (RMVs) are relatively less studied than other types of circulating MVs despite red blood cells (RBCs) being the most abundant intravascular cell. This may be in part due the echoes of past misconceptions that RBCs were merely floating anucleate bags of hemoglobin rather than dynamic and responsive cells. The initial aim of this study was to maximize the concentration of RMVs derived from various blood or blood products by focusing on the optimal isolation conditions without creating more MVs from artificial manipulation. We found that allowing RBCs to sediment overnight resulted in a continuum in size of RBC membrane-containing fragments or vesicles extending beyond the 1 \u00c2\u00b5m size limit suggested by many as the maximal size of an MV. Additionally, dilution and centrifugation factors were studied that altered the resultant MV population concentration. The heterogeneous size of RMVs was confirmed in mice models of hemolytic anemia. This methodological finding establishes a new paradigm in that it blurs the line between RBC, fragment, and RMV as well as suggests that the concentration of circulating RMVs may be widely underestimated given that centrifugation removes the majority of such RBC-derived membrane-containing particles."

        "abstract": "Self-stigma has been associated with reduced accuracy of face emotion recognition in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). Stigma may also relate to slowing of performance during cognitive tasks for which a negative stereotype is relevant. This study aimed to investigate the association of mental illness stigma with face emotion recognition among CHR individuals. Participants were 143 CHR individuals identified using the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS). Face emotion recognition was assessed using the Penn Emotion Recognition Task (ER-40). Stigma was assessed using discrimination, stereotype awareness, and stereotype agreement subscales of the Mental Health Attitudes Interview for CHR. We tested associations of ER-40 accuracy and response times with these stigma variables, including the role of clinical and demographic factors. Racial/ethnic minoritized participants had higher attenuated positive symptoms than non-minoritized participants. Longer ER-40 response times were correlated with greater stereotype agreement (r=.17, p=.045) and discrimination (r=.22, p=.012). A regression model predicting ER-40 response times revealed an interaction of stereotype agreement with minoritized status (p=.008), with slower response times for minoritized participants as stereotype agreement increased. Greater disorganized symptoms and male gender also predicted longer response times. ER-40 accuracy was not associated with stigma. Overall, minoritized CHR individuals with greater internalized stigma took longer to identify face emotions. Future research is needed to assess whether slower response times are specific to social cues, and if internalized stigma interferes with performance in real-world social situations. Reducing stigma may be an important target for interventions that aim to improve social skills."

In CASP14, model accuracy estimation results were evaluated in terms of both global and local structure accuracy, as in the previous CASPs. Unlike the previous CASPs that did not show pronounced improvements in performance, the best single-model method (from the Baker group) showed an improved performance in CASP14, particularly in evaluating global structure accuracy when compared to both the best single-model methods in previous CASPs and the best multi-model methods in the current CASP. Although the CASP14 experiment on model accuracy estimation did not deal with the structures generated by AlphaFold2, new challenges that have arisen due to the success of AlphaFold2 are discussed."

The most recent experiment (CASP13 held in 2018) saw dramatic progress in structure modeling without use of structural templates (historically \"ab initio\" modeling). Progress was driven by the successful application of deep learning techniques to predict inter-residue distances. In turn, these results drove dramatic improvements in three-dimensional structure accuracy: With the proviso that there are an adequate number of sequences known for the protein family, the new methods essentially solve the long-standing problem of predicting the fold topology of monomeric proteins. Further, the number of sequences required in the alignment has fallen substantially. There is also substantial improvement in the accuracy of template-based models. Other areas-model refinement, accuracy estimation, and the structure of protein assemblies-have again yielded interesting results. CASP13 placed increased emphasis on the use of sparse data together with modeling and chemical crosslinking, SAXS, and NMR all yielded more mature results. This paper summarizes the key outcomes of CASP13. The special issue of PROTEINS contains papers describing the CASP13 assessments in each modeling category and contributions from the participants."

Genome editing was used to test whether the absence of this sequence was associated with the horned phenotype. Two gRNAs with high mutation efficiencies targeting the 5' and the 3' regions flanking the lincRNA#1 sequence were co-injected with Cas9 as ribonucleoprotein complexes into bovine zygotes (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030121) 6&nbsp;h post insemination. Of the resulting blastocysts (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203031), 84% had the expected 3.7&nbsp;kb deletion; of these embryos with the 3.7&nbsp;kb deletions, 88% were biallelic knockouts. Thirty-nine presumptive edited 7-day blastocysts were transferred to 13 synchronized recipient cows resulting in ten pregnancies, five with embryos heterozygous for the dominant PC POLLED allele at the POLLED locus, and five with the recessive pp genotype. Eight (80%) of the resulting fetuses were biallelic lincRNA#1 knockouts, with the remaining two being mosaic. RT-qPCR analysis was used to confirm the absence of lincRNA#1 expression in knockout fetuses. Phenotypic and histological analysis of the genotypically (PCp) POLLED, lincRNA#1 knockout fetuses revealed similar morphology to non-edited, control polled fetuses, indicating the absence of lincRNA#1 alone does not result in a horned phenotype."

        "abstract": "Resistance to immunotherapy is a significant challenge, and the scarcity of human models hinders the identification of the underlying mechanisms. To address this limitation, we constructed an autologous humanized mouse (aHM) model with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and tumors from 2 melanoma patients progressing to immunotherapy. Unlike mismatched humanized mouse (mHM) models, generated from cord blood-derived HSPCs and tumors from different donors, the aHM recapitulates a patient-specific tumor microenvironment (TME). When patient tumors were implanted on aHM, mHM, and NOD/SCID/IL2rg-/- (NSG) cohorts, tumors appeared earlier and grew faster on NSG and mHM cohorts. We observed that immune cells differentiating in the aHM were relatively more capable of circulating peripherally, invading into tumors and interacting with the TME. A heterologous, human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A) matched cohort also yielded slower growing tumors than non-HLA-matched mHM, indicating that a less permissive immune environment inhibits tumor progression. When the aHM, mHM, and NSG cohorts were treated with immunotherapies mirroring what the originating patients received, tumor growth in the aHM accelerated, similar to the progression observed in the patients. This rapid growth was associated with decreased immune cell infiltration, reduced interferon gamma (IFN\u00ce\u00b3)-related gene expression, and a reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation, events that were replicated in vitro using tumor-derived cell lines. IMPLICATIONS: Engrafted adult HSPCs give rise to more tumor infiltrative immune cells, increased HLA matching leads to slower tumor initiation and growth, and continuing immunotherapy past progression can paradoxically lead to increased growth."

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Recent studies reported therapeutic effects of Smad7 on oral mucositis in mice without compromising radiation therapy-induced cancer cell killing in neighboring oral cancer. This study aims to assess whether a Smad7-based biologic can treat oral mucositis in a clinically relevant setting by establishing an oral mucositis model in dogs and analyzing molecular targets. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We created a truncated human Smad7 protein fused with the cell-penetrating Tat tag (Tat-PYC-Smad7). We used intensity modulated radiation therapy to induce oral mucositis in dogs and applied Tat-PYC-Smad7 to the oral mucosa in dose-finding studies after intensity modulated radiation therapy. Clinical outcomes were evaluated. Molecular targets were analyzed in biopsies and serum samples. RESULTS: Tat-PYC-Smad7 treatment significantly shortened the duration of grade 3 oral mucositis based on double-blinded Veterinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scores and histopathology evaluations. Topically applied Tat-PYC-Smad7 primarily penetrated epithelial cells and was undetectable in serum. NanoString nCounter Canine IO Panel identified that, compared to the vehicle samples, top molecular changes in Tat-PYC-Smad7 treated samples include reductions in inflammation and cell death and increases in cell growth and DNA repair. Consistently, immunostaining shows that Tat-PYC-Smad7 reduced DNA damage and neutrophil infiltration with attenuated TGF-\u00ce\u00b2 and NF\u00ce\u00baB signaling. Furthermore, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 and TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 were lower in Tat-PYC-Smad7 treated mucosa and serum samples compared to those in vehicle controls. CONCLUSIONS: Topical Tat-PYC-Smad7 application demonstrated therapeutic effects on oral mucositis induced by intensity modulated radiation therapy in dogs. The local effects of Tat-PYC-Smad7 targeted molecules involved in oral mucositis pathogenesis as well as reduced systemic inflammatory cytokines."

        "abstract": "We assessed the roles of Smad7 in skin inflammation and wound healing using genetic and pharmacological approaches. In K5.TGF\u00ce\u00b21/K5.Smad7 bigenic (double transgenic) mice, Smad7 transgene expression reversed transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u00ce\u00b21 transgene-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and subsequent epidermal hyperplasia and molecularly abolished TGF-\u00ce\u00b2 and NF-\u00ce\u00baB activation. Next, we produced recombinant human Smad7 protein with a Tat-tag (Tat-Smad7) that rapidly enters cells. Subcutaneous injection of Tat-Smad7 attenuated infiltration of F4/80+ and CD11b+ leukocytes and \u00ce\u00b1-smooth muscle actin+ fibroblasts before attenuating epidermal hyperplasia in K5.TGF\u00ce\u00b21 skin. Furthermore, topically applied Tat-Smad7 on K5.TGF\u00ce\u00b21 skin wounds accelerated wound closure, with improved re-epithelialization and reductions in inflammation and fibrotic response. A short treatment with Tat-Smad7 was also sufficient to reduce TGF-\u00ce\u00b2 and NF-\u00ce\u00baB signaling in K5.TGF\u00ce\u00b21 skin and wounds. Relevant to the clinic, we found that human diabetic wounds had elevated TGF-\u00ce\u00b2 and NF-\u00ce\u00baB signaling compared with normal skin. To assess the oncogenic risk of a potential Smad7-based therapy, we exposed K5.Smad7 skin to chemical carcinogenesis and found reduced myeloid leukocyte infiltration in tumors but not accelerated carcinogenesis compared with wild-type littermates. Our study suggests the feasibility of using exogenous Smad7 below an oncogenic level to alleviate skin inflammation and wound healing defects associated with excessive activation of TGF-\u00ce\u00b2 and NF-\u00ce\u00baB."

Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which modulates the survival and functionality of lymphocytes, is an attractive target for new immunotherapies but one that is limited by presence of regulatory T&nbsp;cells (Tregs) expressing the high-affinity IL-2R\u00ce\u00b1. The bispecific immunocytokine PD1-IL2v preferentially delivers IL-2 signaling through IL-2R\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b3 on PD-1-expressing cells. Selectively targeting the intermediate-affinity IL-2R\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b3 can be leveraged to induce anti-tumor immune responses in effector T&nbsp;cells and natural killer (NK) cells while limiting the negative regulation of IL-2R\u00ce\u00b1 activation on Tregs. Using radiation therapy (RT) in combination with PD1-IL2v improves local tumor control and survival, and controls metastatic spread in orthotopic HNSCC tumor models. PD1-IL2v drives systemic activation and expansion of circulating and tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T&nbsp;cells and NK cells while limiting Treg-mediated immunosuppression. These data show that PD1-L2v induces durable systemic tumor control in HNSCC."

        "abstract": "PurposeAlthough recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) has generated much excitement as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer, activity in human clinical trials has been modest to date, in part due to the risks of toxicity with significant dose escalation. Since pulmonary metastases are a major site of distant failure in human and dog cancers, we sought to investigate inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with naturally occurring lung metastases from osteosarcoma (OSA) or melanoma. We hypothesized a favorable benefit/risk profile given the concentrated delivery to the lungs with decreased systemic exposure.Experimental designWe performed a phase I trial of inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with gross pulmonary metastases using a traditional 3+3 cohort design. A starting dose of 10 \u00c2\u00b5g twice daily \u00c3\u2014 14 days was used based on human, non-human primate, and murine studies. Safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were the primary objectives, while response rates, progression-free and overall survival (OS), and pharmacokinetic and immune correlative analyses were secondary.ResultsFrom October 2018 to December 2020, we enrolled 21 dogs with 18 dogs reaching the 28-day response assessment to be evaluable. At dose level 5 (70 \u00ce\u00bcg), we observed two DLTs, thereby establishing 50 \u00c2\u00b5g twice daily \u00c3\u2014 14 days as the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose. Among 18 evaluable dogs, we observed one complete response >1 year, one partial response with resolution of multiple target lesions, and five stable disease for an overall clinical benefit rate of 39%. Plasma rhIL-15 quantitation revealed detectable and sustained rhIL-15 concentrations between 1-hour and 6 hour postnebulization. Decreased pretreatment lymphocyte counts were significantly associated with clinical benefit. Cytotoxicity assays of banked peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed significant increases in peak cytotoxicity against canine melanoma and OSA targets that correlated with OS.ConclusionsIn this first-in-dog clinical trial of inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with advanced metastatic disease, we observed promising clinical activity when administered as a monotherapy for only 14 days. These data have significant clinical and biological implications for both dogs and humans with refractory lung metastases and support exploration of combinatorial therapies using inhaled rhIL-15."

In order for fracture healing to occur, the necessary building blocks for bone metabolism and synthesis must be supplied through proper nutrition. Pharmacologic therapies aimed at modulating the inflammatory response to fractures have the potential to interfere with the synthesis of molecules needed for the production of bone. Infection can interfere with, and even prevent normal fracture healing from occurring. Cellular and genetic treatment strategies are actively being developed to target deficiencies, and bridge gaps that can influence how fractures heal.

        "abstract": "Transport-reaction processes, which are typically described by parabolic or hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), play an important role within the chemical process industries. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop feedback control techniques that operate transport-reaction processes in an economically optimal fashion in the presence of constraints in the process states and manipulated inputs. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) is a predictive control scheme that combines process economics and feedback control into an integrated framework with the potential of improving the closed-loop process economic performance compared to traditional control methodologies. In this work, we address two key issues in applying EMPC to transport-reaction processes. First, we focus on a system of nonlinear parabolic PDEs and propose a novel EMPC design integrating adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (APOD) method with a high-order finite-difference method to handle state constraints. The computational efficiency and constraint handling properties of this scheme are evaluated using a tubular reactor example modeled by two nonlinear parabolic PDEs. Second, we formulate an EMPC system that accounts for both manipulated input and state constraints for a system of first-order hyperbolic PDEs. Various closed-loop simulation scenarios are presented to demonstrate the overall effectiveness of this EMPC scheme using a plug flow reactor example."

A proper dynamic response (trajectory following, vibration suppression, etc.) is difficult to obtain using open-loop control, as it is much better suited for quasistatic device operation. As a result, the dynamic performance of MEMS devices in many applications is not fully achieved. In this paper we propose to use input-shaping techniques along with an identified reduced-order model to generate suitable input profiles for MEMS actuators. This systematic approach is a major improvement over the current Finite Element/Design of Experiments practices in the MEMS community."

        "abstract": "Wildfires pose a major health risk for humans, wildlife, and domestic animals. We previously discovered pathophysiologic parallels between domestic cats with naturally occurring smoke inhalation and thermal burn injuries and human beings with similar injuries; these were characterized by transient myocardial thickening, cardiac troponin I elevation and formation of intracardiac thrombosis. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, results from murine models suggest that platelet priming and activation may contribute to a global hypercoagulable state and thrombosis. Herein, we evaluated and compared the degree of platelet activation, platelet response to physiologic agonists and levels of platelet-derived microvesicles (PDMV) in 29 cats with naturally occurring wildfire thermal injuries (WF), 21 clinically healthy cats with subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 11 healthy cats without HCM (CC). We also quantified and compared circulating PDMVs in WF cats to CC cats. In addition, we examined the association between thrombotic events, severity of burn injuries, myocardial changes, and the degree of platelet activation in cats exposed to wildfires. Flow cytometric detection of platelet surface P-selectin expression showed that WF cats had increased platelet response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin compared to the two control groups indicating the presence of primed platelets in circulation. In addition, cats in the WF group had increased circulating levels of PDMV, characterized by increased phosphatidylserine on the external leaflet. Cats in the WF group with documented intracardiac thrombosis had elevated platelet activation and platelet priming in the presence of ADP. While high dose arachidonic acid (AA) mostly resulted in platelet inhibition, persistent response to AA was noted among cats in the WF group with intracardiac thrombosis. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses demonstrated that increased platelet response to AA was independently associated with thrombotic events. This is the first study reporting the significant association between platelet priming and intracardiac thrombosis in domestic cats with naturally occurring wildfire-related injuries and smoke inhalation. Further studies are required to delineate additional mechanisms between inflammation and thrombosis, especially regarding platelet primers and the cyclooxygenase pathway.One sentence summaryPlatelet activation and shedding of platelet-derived microvesicles due to platelet priming is present following naturally occurring wildfire smoke exposure and thermal burn injuries in a population of domestic cats."

Unfortunately, PCR-based testing has limitations and may not result in a positive test early in the course of infection before symptoms develop. Enveloped RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, alter peripheral blood methylation and DNA methylation signatures may characterize asymptomatic versus symptomatic infection. We used Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array to profile peripheral blood samples from 164 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, of whom 8 had no symptoms. Epigenome-wide association analysis identified 10 methylation sites associated with infection and a quantile-quantile plot showed little inflation. These preliminary results suggest that differences in methylation patterns may distinguish asymptomatic from symptomatic infection."

        "abstract": "Females show a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer's disease pathology and higher Alzheimer's disease dementia prevalences compared to males, yet the mechanisms driving these vulnerabilities are unknown. There is sexual dimorphism in immunological functioning, and neuroimmune processes are implicated in Alzheimer's disease genesis. Using neuropathology indicators from human brain tissue, we examined the mediational role of microglial activation on the relationship between amyloid and tau and how it differs by sex. 187 decedents (64% female; 89 mean age at death; 62% non-demented) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project completed neuropathological evaluations with brain tissue quantified for microglial activation, amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 and tau. Proportion of morphologically activated microglia was determined via immunohistochemistry (HLA-DP-DQ-DR) and morphological staging (stage I, II or III). Amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 and tau burden were quantified via immunohistochemistry (M00872 or AT8, respectively). Using causal counterfactual modelling, we estimated the mediational effect of microglial activation on the amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 to tau relationship in the whole sample and stratified by sex (amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 \u00e2\u2020\u2019 microglial activation \u00e2\u2020\u2019 tau). Alternative models tested the role of microglia activation as the precipitating event (microglial activation \u00e2\u2020\u2019 amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 \u00e2\u2020\u2019 tau). Microglial activation significantly mediated 33% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10-67] of the relationship between amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 and tau in the whole sample; stratified analyses suggested this effect was stronger and only statistically significant in females. 57% (95% CI 22-100) of the effect of amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 on tau was mediated through microglial activation in females, compared to 19% (95% CI 0-64) in males. Regional analyses suggested that mediational effects were driven by greater cortical versus subcortical microglial activation. Relationships were independent of cerebrovascular disease indices. Alternative models suggested that in females, microglial activation was a significant exposure both preceding the amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 to tau relationship (mediational effect: 50%, 95% CI 23-90) and directly related to tau burden (microglia direct effect: 50%, 95% CI 10-77). By contrast, in males, only the direct effect of microglial activation to tau reached significance (74%, 95% CI 32-100) (mediational effect: 26%, 95% CI 0-68). Our models suggest a reciprocal, bidirectional relationship between amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 and microglial activation that significantly accounts for tau burden in females. By contrast, in males, direct independent (non-mediational) relationships between microglial activation or amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 with tau were observed. Microglial activation may be disproportionately important for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in females. Determining sex-specific vulnerabilities to Alzheimer's disease development both inform fundamental pathophysiology and support precision health approaches for this heterogeneous disease."

        "abstract": "The current generation of total-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanners offer significant sensitivity increase with an extended axial imaging extent. With the large volume of lutetium-based scintillation crystals that are used as detector elements in these scanners, there is an increased flux of background radiation originating from 176Lu decay in the crystals and higher sensitivity for detecting it. Combined with the ability of scanning the entire body in a single bed position, this allows more effective utilization of the lutetium background as a transmission source for estimating 511 keV attenuation coefficients. In this study, utilization of the lutetium background radiation for attenuation correction in total-body PET was studied using Monte Carlo simulations of a 3D whole-body XCAT phantom in the uEXPLORER PET scanner, with particular focus on ultralow-dose PET scans that are now made possible with these scanners. Effects of an increased acceptance angle, reduced scan durations, and Compton scattering on PET quantification were studied. Furthermore, quantification accuracy of lutetium-based attenuation correction was compared for a 20-min scan of the whole body on the uEXPLORER, a one-meter-long, and a conventional 24-cm-long scanner. Quantification and lesion contrast were minimally affected in both long axial field-of-view scanners and in a whole-body 20-min scan, the mean bias in all analyzed organs of interest were within a \u00c2\u00b110% range compared to ground-truth activity maps. Quantification was affected in certain organs, when scan duration was reduced to 5 min or a reduced acceptance angle of 17\u00c2\u00b0 was used. Analysis of the Compton scattered events suggests that implementing a scatter correction method for the transmission data will be required, and increasing the energy threshold from 250 keV to 290 keV can reduce the computational costs and data rates, with negligible effects on PET quantification. Finally, the current results can serve as groundwork for transferring lutetium-based attenuation correction into research and clinical practice."

However, the mechanisms by which maternal adiposity influences fetal developmental programming remain to be elucidated. We aimed to understand the impact of maternal obesity on the metabolism of both pregnant mothers and their offspring, as well as on metabolic, brain, and behavioral development of offspring by utilizing metabolomics, protein, and behavioral assays in a non-human primate model. We found that maternal obesity was associated with elevated inflammation and significant alterations in metabolites of energy metabolism and one-carbon metabolism in maternal plasma and urine, as well as in the placenta. Infants that were born to obese mothers were significantly larger at birth compared to those that were born to lean mothers. Additionally, they exhibited significantly reduced novelty preference and significant alterations in their emotional response to stress situations. These changes coincided with differences in the phosphorylation of enzymes in the brain mTOR signaling pathway between infants that were born to obese and lean mothers and correlated with the concentration of maternal plasma betaine during pregnancy. In summary, gestational obesity significantly impacted the infant systemic and brain metabolome and adaptive behaviors."

Aspirin (acetylsalicylate, ASA) inhibits AA oxidation by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2.HypothesisChronic low-dose ASA will downregulate brain AA metabolism in HIV-1 transgenic rats.MethodsNine month-old HIV-1 transgenic and wildtype rats were given 42 days of 10mg/kg/day ASA or nothing in drinking water; eicosanoids were measured using ELISAs on microwaved brain extracts.ResultsBrain 15-epi-lipoxin A4 and 8-isoprostane concentrations were significantly higher in HIV-1 transgenic than wildtype rats; these differences were prevented by ASA. ASA reduced prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 concentrations in HIV-1 Tg but not wildtype rats.

        "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the nature of environmental factors that contribute to behavioral health is critical for successful prevention strategies in individuals at risk for psychiatric disorders. These factors are typically experiential in nature, such as stress and urbanicity, but nutrition--in particular dietary deficiency of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs)-has increasingly been implicated in the symptomatic onset of schizophrenia and mood disorders, which typically occurs during adolescence to early adulthood. Thus, adolescence might be the critical age range for the negative impact of diet as an environmental insult.MethodsA rat model involving consecutive generations of n-3 PUFA deficiency was developed on the basis of the assumption that dietary trends toward decreased consumption of these fats began 4-5 decades ago when the parents of current adolescents were born. Behavioral performance in a wide range of tasks as well as markers of dopamine-related neurotransmission was compared in adolescents and adults fed n-3 PUFA adequate and deficient diets.ResultsIn adolescents, dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency across consecutive generations produced a modality-selective and task-dependent impairment in cognitive and motivated behavior distinct from the deficits observed in adults. Although this dietary deficiency affected expression of dopamine-related proteins in both age groups in adolescents but not adults, there was an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression that was selective to the dorsal striatum.ConclusionsThese data support a nutritional contribution to optimal cognitive and affective functioning in adolescents. Furthermore, they suggest that n-3 PUFA deficiency disrupts adolescent behaviors through enhanced dorsal striatal dopamine availability."

        "abstract": "Many commonly used chemotherapies induce mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac muscle, which leads to cardiotoxicity and heart failure later in life. Dietary long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) have demonstrated cardioprotective function in non-chemotherapy models of heart failure, potentially through the formation of LC n-3 PUFA-derived bioactive lipid metabolites. However, it is unknown whether dietary supplementation with LC n-3 PUFA can protect against chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. To test this, 36 female ovariectomized C57BL/6J mice were randomized in a two-by-two factorial design to either a low (0 g/kg EPA + DHA) or high (12.2 g/kg EPA + DHA) LC n-3 PUFA diet, and received either two vehicle or two chemotherapy (9 mg/kg anthracycline + 90 mg/kg cyclophosphamide) tail vein injections separated by two weeks. Body weight and food intake were measured as well as heart gene expression and fatty acid composition. Heart mitochondria were isolated using differential centrifugation. Mitochondrial isolate oxylipin and N-acylethanolamide levels were measured by mass spectrometry after alkaline hydrolysis. LC n-3 PUFA supplementation attenuated some chemotherapy-induced differences (Myh7, Col3a1) in heart gene expression, and significantly altered various lipid species in cardiac mitochondrial preparations including several epoxy fatty acids [17(18)-EpETE] and N-acylethanolamines (arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA), suggesting a possible functional link between heart lipids and cardiotoxicity."

Using human cells, we aimed to evaluate the indoor air toxic risk from the condensed water collected from several office and laboratory rooms in two different buildings, both located at the University of Texas at Austin. Condensate samples were collected by using stainless steel collectors (E-collectors), and the effects of samples on the viability of human BJ fibroblast and activated THP-1-monocytes in vitro were investigated by using WST-1 cytotoxicity assays. Toxicological assessment utilizing human BJ fibroblasts and activated THP-1-monocytes of condensate from air reflects the acute toxic effects of the indoor air.

        "abstract": "This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of physical task-based assessments used to evaluate the multi-grasp dexterity and functional impact of varying control systems in pediatric and adult upper-limb prostheses. Our search returned 1,442 research articles from online databases, of which 25 tests-selected for their scientific rigor, evaluation metrics, and psychometric properties-met our review criteria. We observed that despite significant advancements in the mechatronics of upper-limb prostheses, these 25 assessments are the only validated evaluation methods that have emerged since the first measure in 1948. This not only underscores the lack of a consistently updated, standardized assessment protocol for new innovations, but also reveals an unsettling trend: as technology outpaces standardized evaluation measures, developers will often support their novel devices through custom, study-specific tests. These boutique assessments can potentially introduce bias and jeopardize validity. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that current validated evaluation methods often overlook the influence of competing interests on test success. Clinical settings and research laboratories differ in their time constraints, access to specialized equipment, and testing objectives, all of which significantly influence assessment selection and consistent use. Therefore, we propose a dual testing approach to address the varied demands of these distinct environments. Additionally, we found that almost all existing task-based assessments lack an integrated mechanism for collecting patient feedback, which we assert is essential for a holistic evaluation of upper-limb prostheses. Our review underscores the pressing need for a standardized evaluation protocol capable of objectively assessing the rapidly advancing prosthetic technologies across all testing domains."

        "abstract": "How do humans learn from raw sensory experience? Throughout life, but most\r\nobviously in infancy, we learn without explicit instruction. We propose a\r\ndetailed biological mechanism for the widely-embraced idea that learning is\r\nbased on the differences between predictions and actual outcomes (i.e.,\r\npredictive error-driven learning). Specifically, numerous weak projections into\r\nthe pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus generate top-down predictions, and sparse,\r\nfocal driver inputs from lower areas supply the actual outcome, originating in\r\nlayer 5 intrinsic bursting (5IB) neurons. Thus, the outcome is only briefly\r\nactivated, roughly every 100 msec (i.e., 10 Hz, alpha), resulting in a temporal\r\ndifference error signal, which drives local synaptic changes throughout the\r\nneocortex, resulting in a biologically-plausible form of error backpropagation\r\nlearning. We implemented these mechanisms in a large-scale model of the visual\r\nsystem, and found that the simulated inferotemporal (IT) pathway learns to\r\nsystematically categorize 3D objects according to invariant shape properties,\r\nbased solely on predictive learning from raw visual inputs. These categories\r\nmatch human judgments on the same stimuli, and are consistent with neural\r\nrepresentations in IT cortex in primates."

        "abstract": "Plant-parasitic nematodes are a major threat to crop production in all agricultural systems. The scarcity of classical resistance genes highlights a pressing need to find new ways to develop nematode-resistant germplasm. Here, we sequence and assemble a high-quality phased genome of the model cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii to provide a platform for the first system-wide dual analysis of host and parasite gene expression over time, covering all major parasitism stages. Analysis of the hologenome of the plant-nematode infection site identified metabolic pathways that were incomplete in the parasite but complemented by the host. Using a combination of bioinformatic, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we show that a highly atypical completion of vitamin B5 biosynthesis by the parasitic animal, putatively enabled by a horizontal gene transfer from a bacterium, is required for full pathogenicity. Knockout of either plant-encoded or now nematode-encoded steps in the pathway significantly reduces parasitic success. Our experiments establish a reference for cyst nematodes, further our understanding of the evolution of plant-parasitism by nematodes, and show that congruent differential expression of metabolic pathways in the infection hologenome represents a new way to find nematode susceptibility genes. The approach identifies genome-editing-amenable targets for future development of nematode-resistant crops."

Electroencephalogram (EEG) with time-locked video over 31\u00e2\u20ac\u2030hours determined occurrence of the abnormal movements to be within 20 to 180\u00e2\u20ac\u2030seconds of the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but not at any other stage of wakefulness or sleep. No epileptiform activity was noted. Clinical signs of generalized tetanus resolved over 8\u00e2\u20ac\u2030weeks with antimicrobial and symptomatic treatment, and sleep-associated movements resolved 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2030weeks after presentation.Clinical relevanceRapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has been suspected in dogs with generalized tetanus but not confirmed by correlation of repeated episodes of vocalization or motor behaviors or both with REM sleep defined by an EEG. The case further defines RBD in dogs with tetanus, and highlights the value of EEG to differentiate among different parasomnias and epileptiform activity."

        "abstract": "Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) has a strong clinical association with the development of hip osteoarthritis (OA); however, the pathobiological mechanisms underlying the transition from focal impingement to global joint degeneration remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to use whole-genome RNA sequencing to identify and subsequently validate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in femoral head articular cartilage samples from patients with FAI and hip OA secondary to FAI. Thirty-seven patients were included in the study with whole-genome RNA sequencing performed on 10 gender-matched patients in the FAI and OA cohorts and the remaining specimens were used for validation analyses. We identified a total of 3531 DEGs between the FAI and OA cohorts with multiple targets for genes implicated in canonical OA pathways.&nbsp;Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation confirmed increased expression of FGF18 and WNT16 in the FAI samples, while there was increased expression of MMP13 and ADAMTS4 in the OA samples. Expression levels of FGF18 and WNT16 were also higher in FAI samples with mild cartilage damage compared to FAI samples with severe cartilage damage or OA cartilage. Our study further expands the knowledge regarding distinct genetic reprogramming in the cartilage between FAI and hip OA patients. We independently validated the results of the sequencing analysis and found increased expression of anabolic markers in patients with FAI and minimal histologic cartilage damage, suggesting that anabolic signaling may be increased in early FAI with a transition to catabolic and inflammatory gene expression as FAI progresses towards more severe hip OA.&nbsp;Clinical significance:Cam-type&nbsp;FAI has a strong clinical association with hip OA; however, the cellular pathophysiology of disease progression remains poorly understood. Several previous studies have demonstrated increased expression of inflammatory markers in FAI cartilage samples, suggesting the involvement of these inflammatory pathways in the disease progression. Our study further expands the knowledge regarding distinct genetic reprogramming in the cartilage between FAI and hip OA patients. In addition to differences in inflammatory gene expression, we also identified differential expression in multiple pathways involved in hip OA progression."

        "abstract": "Case reportTraumatic hip dislocations require prompt diagnosis and reduction to preserve the native joint. The classic irreducible posterior hip fracture-dislocation has been described as an immobile, slightly flexed, and internally rotated hip on physical exam. Classically, this irreducible pattern is associated with an ipsilateral femoral head fracture. The purpose of our report is to present an irreducible posterior hip dislocation with preserved motion in the setting of an unstable pelvic ring injury without associated femoral head pathology. Despite lacking clinical features of an irreducible hip, closed reduction in the emergency and operating rooms was unsuccessful, even after frame application for pelvis stability. Persistent irreducibility necessitated open reduction, where the femoral head was found to be buttonholed through the posterior hip capsule and blocking reduction.ConclusionA posteriorly dislocated hip with preserved motion in the setting of a concomitant unstable pelvic ring injury may belie the true locked nature of the femoroacetabular dislocation and high suspicion for femoral head incarceration is required. The description of this unique irreducible fracture pattern and the stepwise approach used for reduction may be useful for other surgeons who may encounter similar patterns of injury."

        "abstract": "Spermatogonial stem cells functionality reside&nbsp;in the slow-cycling and heterogeneous undifferentiated spermatogonia cell population. This pool of cells supports lifelong fertility in adult males by balancing self-renewal and differentiation to produce haploid gametes. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning long-term stemness of undifferentiated spermatogonia during adulthood remain unclear. Here, we discover that an epigenetic regulator, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), shields adult undifferentiated spermatogonia from differentiation, maintains slow cycling, and directs commitment to differentiation during steady-state spermatogenesis in adults. We show that PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 is an epigenetic hallmark of adult undifferentiated spermatogonia. Indeed, spermatogonial differentiation is accompanied by a global loss of H3K27me3. Disruption of PRC1 impairs global H3K27me3 deposition, leading to precocious spermatogonial differentiation. Therefore, PRC1 directs PRC2-H3K27me3 deposition to maintain the self-renewing state of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Importantly, in contrast to its role in other tissue stem cells, PRC1 negatively regulates the cell cycle to maintain slow cycling of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Our findings have implications for how epigenetic regulators can be tuned to regulate the stem cell potential, cell cycle&nbsp;and differentiation to ensure lifelong fertility in adult males."

There is growing concern regarding adverse health and development outcomes of excess iron provision in early life. Excess iron may directly damage developing organs through the formation of reactive oxygen species, alter systemic inflammatory signaling, and/or dysregulate trace mineral metabolism. To better characterize the in vivo effects of excess iron on development, we utilized a pre-weanling rat pup model. Lewis rat litters were culled to eight pups (four males and four females) and randomly assigned to daily supplementation groups receiving either vehicle control (CON; 10% w/v sucrose solution) or ferrous sulfate (FS) iron at one of the following doses: 10, 30, or 90 mg iron/kg body weight-FS-10, FS-30, and FS-90, respectively-from postnatal day (PD) 2 through 9. FS-90 litters, but not FS-30 or FS-10, failed to thrive compared to CON litters and had smaller brains on PD 10. Among the groups, FS-90 liver iron levels were highest, as were white blood cell counts. Compared to CON, circulating MCP-1 and liver zinc were increased in FS-90 pups, whereas liver copper was decreased. Growth defects due to excess FS provision in pre-weanling rats may be related to liver injury, inflammation, and altered trace mineral metabolism."

African Americans report more external locus of control than non-Hispanic Whites, and external locus of control is associated with poorer health and cognition. The aims of this study were to compare cognitive training gains between African American and non-Hispanic White participants in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study and determine whether racial differences in training gains are mediated by locus of control. The sample comprised 2,062 (26% African American) adults aged 65 and older who participated in memory, reasoning, or speed training. Latent growth curve models evaluated predictors of 10-year cognitive trajectories separately by training group. Multiple group modeling examined associations between training gains and locus of control across racial groups. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans evidenced less improvement in memory and reasoning performance after training. These effects were partially mediated by locus of control, controlling for age, sex, education, health, depression, testing site, and initial cognitive ability. African Americans reported more external locus of control, which was associated with smaller training gains. External locus of control also had a stronger negative association with reasoning training gain for African Americans than for Whites. No racial difference in training gain was identified for speed training. Future intervention research with African Americans should test whether explicitly targeting external locus of control leads to greater cognitive improvement following cognitive training."

We used a path analysis to test effects of SES, neighborhood safety, and physical activity on mental health and SRH.ResultsLow SES was associated with greater neighborhood safety concerns, which were negatively associated with physical activity, which was then negatively related to mental health and SRH. This model was similar across different racial/ethnic and gender groups, but mean levels in the constructs differed across groups.ConclusionsSES plays an important role in SRH and mental health, and this effect is further nuanced by race/ethnicity and gender.

We examined the association between early-life SES and adversity and late-life cross-sectional cognitive outcomes as well as global cognitive decline, hypothesizing that adulthood SES would mediate these associations.MethodsOur sample (N = 837) was a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of non-Hispanic/Latino White (48%), Black (27%), and Hispanic/Latino (19%) participants from Northern California. Participant addresses were geocoded to the level of the census tract, and US Census Tract 2010 variables (e.g., percent with high school diploma) were extracted and combined to create a neighborhood SES composite. We used multilevel latent variable models to estimate early-life (e.g., parental education, whether participant ever went hungry) and adult (participant's education, main occupation) SES factors and their associations with cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive outcomes of episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function, and spatial ability.ResultsChild and adult factors were strongly related to domain-specific cognitive intercepts (0.20-0.48 SD per SD of SES factor); in contrast, SES factors were not related to global cognitive change (0.001-0.01 SD per year per SD of SES factor). Adulthood SES mediated a large percentage (68-75%) of the total early-life effect on cognition.ConclusionsEarly-life sociocontextual factors are more strongly associated with cross-sectional late-life cognitive performance compared to cognitive change; this effect is largely mediated through associations with adulthood SES."

        "abstract": "Compared to other food groups, vegetable intakes are lowest relative to recommendations. Breastfeeding and initial introduction to vegetables may help infants establish long-lasting taste preferences. We examined the relationship between breastfeeding and initial vegetable introduction and vegetable intake in early childhood (ages 13-60 months). This repeated cross-sectional study used data from the national WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study-2 collected from low-income mother/caregivers about infants from around birth through age 5 (60 months; n = 3773). Survey-weighted adjusted regression models assessed associations between breastfeeding and vegetable introduction measures with vegetable consumption at child ages 13, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Longer breastfeeding duration was associated with a slightly, but significantly, greater variety of vegetables consumed/day in early childhood. There was also a small but positive statistically significant association between the number of different types of vegetables consumed on a given day at 9 months and the amount and variety of vegetables consumed/day in early childhood. Age of initial vegetables introduction and whether vegetables were the first/second food introduced were not consistently related to the amount or variety of vegetables consumed later in childhood. Longer breastfeeding and introduction to a greater variety of vegetables at 9 months may be behaviors to target to increase consumption of a greater variety of vegetables by young children."

While they will play a fundamental role in delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals, associated opportunities and threats are yet to be considered systematically. We report on a horizon scan evaluating robotics and autonomous systems impact on all Sustainable Development Goals, involving 102 experts from around the world. Robotics and autonomous systems are likely to transform how the Sustainable Development Goals are achieved, through replacing and supporting human activities, fostering innovation, enhancing remote access and improving monitoring. Emerging threats relate to reinforcing inequalities, exacerbating environmental change, diverting resources from tried-and-tested solutions and reducing freedom and privacy through inadequate governance. Although predicting future impacts of robotics and autonomous systems on the Sustainable Development Goals is difficult, thoroughly examining technological developments early is essential to prevent unintended detrimental consequences. Additionally, robotics and autonomous systems should be considered explicitly when developing future iterations of the Sustainable Development Goals to avoid reversing progress or exacerbating inequalities."

        "abstract": "Crosses between parents with high and low levels of seed dormancy in wild oat were used to produce F1, F2 and backcross populations. Germination phenotypes were determined by imbibing all populations at 15 and 20\u00c2\u00b0C. Rapid germination of genetically more dormant generations was favoured at the lower temperature, i.e. a generation by germination temperature interaction was observed. Evidence that dominance shifted from early germination at 15\u00c2\u00b0C to late germination at 20\u00c2\u00b0C is presented. Epistatic gene action may have been detected at 20\u00c2\u00b0C but not at 15\u00c2\u00b0C. Cumulative germination percentages of F1 caryopses imbibed at 10, 15, 20 and 25\u00c2\u00b0C revealed an inverse relationship between germination rate and temperature. The narrow-sense family heritability of the seed dormancy phenotype of F7 recombinant inbred lines per se was h(f/2, F=1) = 0.75 with exact confidence limits of 0.64 and 0.83. Six factors were estimated to be segregating between the dormant and nondormant parents. Genotype by germination temperature interactions may play an adaptive role that allows wild oat to persist in diverse ecosystems."

Previously, we identified about 0.9 million SNP markers by sequencing transcriptomes of 27 diverse alfalfa genotypes. From this SNP set, we developed an Illumina Infinium array containing 9,277 SNPs. Using this array, we genotyped 280 diverse alfalfa genotypes and several genotypes from related species. About 81% (7,476) of the SNPs met the criteria for quality control and showed polymorphisms. The alfalfa SNP array also showed a high level of transferability for several closely related Medicago species. Principal component analysis and model-based clustering showed clear population structure corresponding to subspecies and ploidy levels. Within cultivated tetraploid alfalfa, genotypes from dormant and nondormant cultivars were largely assigned to different clusters; genotypes from semidormant cultivars were split between the groups. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across all genotypes rapidly decayed to 26 Kbp at r(2)\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.2, but the rate varied across ploidy levels and subspecies. A high level of consistency in LD was found between and within the two subpopulations of cultivated dormant and nondormant alfalfa suggesting that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) could be conducted using alfalfa genotypes from throughout the fall dormancy spectrum. However, the relatively low LD levels would require a large number of markers to fully saturate the genome."

        "abstract": "In this study, we explore spectral heterogeneity within plant canopies, a characteristic often observed in stressed plants where certain leaves or intra-leaf regions exhibit stress symptoms while others remain unaffected. Considering this variability in spectral signatures holds promise for enhancing remote sensing methodologies aimed at plant stress detection. Typically, remote sensing techniques analyze the plant as a whole, potentially overlooking stress-related spectral signatures due to the inclusion of unaffected pixels. We used a clustering-based technique, which incorporates semi-supervised learning elements for tuning hyper-parameters, to differentiate spectral patterns associated with and unique to pixels from broomrape-infected (Orobanche spp. and Phelipanche spp.) carrots from unrelated patterns. Ground-based hyperspectral (400\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1000 nm) images of broomrape-infected and non-infected carrot canopies were used in an agglomerative clustering procedure followed by spectral angle mapper (SAM) analysis to identify a spectral endmember indicative of broomrape infection symptoms. Pixels from this cluster constituted an average of 8.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c11.5 % from the canopies of infected plants. Subsequently, we: (a) examined the relationship between carrot leaf mineral content and the percentage of symptomatic pixels to explore stress-induced alterations creating the unique spectral signatures of infected plants; and (b) utilized the inverse mode of PROSPECT, a radiative transfer model (RTM), to derive primary plant traits from the distinct spectral data of each cluster. We found that deficits in two macro elements, phosphorous and potassium, along with two pigments, chlorophyll and carotenoid, were correlated with the symptomatic cluster in infected plants. The methodology presented in this study paves the way for further research into broomrape detection in various crop species, as well as other plant stressors."

PP and mixes did not display an inhibition of the bacteria growth. AN, PP, UL extracts, and mixes exhibited antioxidant activities, with AN showing the strongest dose-response. Thus, AN and UL seaweed extracts reveal promising antibacterial and antioxidant effects and may be candidates for in-feed additives."

In this study, three datasets (two Border Collie; one Italian Spinone) generated using a legacy array (Illumina CanineHD, 173&nbsp;662 SNPs) were utilised to assess the feasibility and accuracy of this approach and to gather additional evidence for the efficacy of canine genotype imputation. The cosmopolitan reference panels used to impute genotypes comprised dogs of 158 breeds, mixed breed dogs, wolves and Chinese indigenous dogs, as well as breed-specific individuals genotyped using the Axiom Canine HD array. The two Border Collie reference panels comprised 808 individuals including 79 Border Collies and 426&nbsp;326 or 426&nbsp;332 SNPs; and the Italian Spinone reference panel comprised 807 individuals including 38 Italian Spinoni and 476&nbsp;313 SNPs. A high accuracy for imputation was observed, with the lowest accuracy observed for one of the Border Collie datasets (mean R2 &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.94) and the highest for the Italian Spinone dataset (mean R2 &nbsp;=&nbsp;0.97). This study's findings demonstrate that imputation of a legacy array study set using a reference panel comprising both breed-specific array data and multi-breed variant data derived from whole genomes is effective and accurate. The process of canine genotype imputation, using the valuable growing resource of publicly available canine genome variant datasets alongside breed-specific data, is described in detail to facilitate and encourage use of this technique in canine genetics."

Screen time is a risk factor for obesity, possibly because of the influence of food and beverage advertising on diet.ObjectiveWe sought to assess longitudinal relations of screen time [ie, television, electronic games, digital versatile discs (DVDs)/videos, and total screen time] with the 2-y changes in consumption of foods of low nutritional quality (FLNQ) that are commonly advertised on screens [ie, sugar-sweetened beverages, fast food, sweets, salty snacks, and the sum of these foods (total FLNQ)] and fruit and vegetables.DesignWith the use of 2004, 2006, and 2008 waves of the Growing Up Today Study II, which consisted of a cohort of 6002 female and 4917 male adolescents aged 9-16 y in 2004, we assessed screen time (change and baseline) in relation to the 2-y dietary changes. Regression models included 4604 girls and 3668 boys with complete screen time and diet data on \u00e2\u2030\u00a52 consecutive questionnaires.ResultsEach hour-per-day increase in television, electronic games, and DVDs/videos was associated with increased intake of total FLNQ (range: 0.10-0.28 servings/d; P < 0.05). Each hour-per-day increase in total screen time predicted increased intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages, fast food, sweets, and salty snacks (range: 0.02-0.06 servings/d; P < 0.001) and decreased intakes of fruit and vegetables (range: -0.05 to -0.02 servings/d; P < 0.05). Greater screen time at baseline (except electronic games in boys) was associated with subsequent increased intake of total FLNQ, and greater screen time at baseline (except DVDs/videos) was associated with decreased intake of fruit and vegetables (P < 0.05). Across sex and food groups and in sensitivity analyses, television was most consistently associated with dietary changes.ConclusionsIncreases in screen time were associated with increased consumption of foods and beverages of low nutritional quality and decreased consumption of fruit and vegetables. Our results caution against excessive use of screen media, especially television, in youth."

        "abstract": "Milk oligosaccharides (MOs) can be prebiotic and antiadhesive, while fatty acids (MFAs) can be antimicrobial. Both have been associated with milk microbes or mammary gland inflammation in humans. Relationships between these milk components and milk microbes or inflammation have not been determined for cows and could help elucidate a novel approach for the dairy industry to promote desired milk microbial composition for improvement of milk quality and reduction of milk waste. We aimed to determine relationships among milk microbiota, MFAs, MOs, lactose, and somatic cell counts (SCC) from Holstein cows, using our previously published data. Raw milk samples were collected at three time points, ranging from early to late lactation. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling and repeated-measures correlation. Unsaturated MFA and short-chain MFA had mostly negative relationships with potentially pathogenic genera, including Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and an unknown Enterobacteriaceae genus but numerous positive relationships with symbionts Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. Conversely, many MOs were positively correlated with potentially pathogenic genera (e.g., Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas), and numerous MOs were negatively correlated with the symbiont Bifidobacterium. The neutral, nonfucosylated MO composed of eight hexoses had a positive relationship with SCC, while lactose had a negative relationship with SCC. One interpretation of these trends might be that in milk, MFAs disrupt primarily pathogenic bacterial cells, causing a relative increase in abundance of beneficial microbial taxa, while MOs respond to and act on pathogenic taxa primarily through antiadhesive methods. Further research is needed to confirm the potential mechanisms driving these correlations. IMPORTANCE Bovine milk can harbor microbes that cause mastitis, milk spoilage, and foodborne illness. Fatty acids found in milk can be antimicrobial and milk oligosaccharides can have antiadhesive, prebiotic, and immune-modulatory effects. Relationships among milk microbes, fatty acids, oligosaccharides, and inflammation have been reported for humans. To our knowledge, associations among the milk microbial composition, fatty acids, oligosaccharides, and lactose have not been reported for healthy lactating cows. Identifying these potential relationships in bovine milk will inform future efforts to characterize direct and indirect interactions of the milk components with the milk microbiota. Since many milk components are associated with herd management practices, determining if these milk components impact milk microbes may provide valuable information for dairy cow management and breeding practices aimed at minimizing harmful and spoilage-causing microbes in raw milk."

We show that the altered protein of an ino mRNA splicing mutant with a less severe phenotype (ino-4) does not have INO activity, and the mutant is partial because it produces a small amount of correctly spliced INO mRNA. Screening for suppressors of ino-4 in a fast neutron-mutagenized population identified a translocated duplication of the ino-4 gene, leading to an increase in the amount of this mRNA. The increased expression led to a decrease in the severity of the mutant effects, indicating that the amount of INO activity quantitatively regulates outer integument growth. The results further confirm that the role of INO in Arabidopsis development is specific to the outer integument of ovules where it quantitatively affects the growth of this structure."

Eight participants performed treadmill exercise followed by assessments of serial reaction time (RT), Stroop effect, verbal delayed memory, and continuous performance working memory in an environmental chamber. A control (21.1&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C) trial, and Hot 1 and Hot 2 (both 37.8&nbsp;\u00c2\u00b0C) trials were run sequentially on two separate days to evaluate the four cognitive tasks. Heat strain (comparing Hot 1 and Hot 2 with the control trial) resulted in impairments in the serial RT test response and Stroop accuracy. Delayed memory was impacted only in the Hot 2 trial compared with the control trial. Given the demonstrated impact of heat on cognitive processes relevant to workers real-world functioning in the workplace, understanding how to assess and monitor vigilant attention in the workplace is essential."

        "abstract": "Inteins are self-splicing polypeptides with an ability to excise themselves from flanking host protein regions with remarkable precision; in the process, they ligate flanked host protein fragments. Inteins are distributed sporadically across all three domains of life (bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes). However, their apparent localized distribution in DNA replication, repair, and recombination proteins (the 3Rs), particularly in bacteria and archaea, is enigmatic. Our understanding of the localized distribution of inteins in the 3Rs, and their possible regulatory role in such distribution, is still only partial. Nevertheless, understanding the chemistry of post-translational self-splicing of inteins has opened up opportunities for protein chemists to modify, manipulate, and bioengineer proteins. Protein-splicing technology is adapted to a wide range of applications, starting with untagged protein purification, site-specific protein labeling, protein biotinylation, isotope incorporation, peptide cyclization, as an antimicrobial target, and so on. This review is focused on the chemistry of splicing; the localized distribution of inteins, particularly in the 3Rs and their possible role in regulating host protein function; and finally, the use of protein-splicing technology in various protein engineering applications."

Syrian golden hamsters recapitulate histopathologic pulmonary vascular lesions reported in patients with COVID-19. Herein, special staining techniques and transmission electron microscopy further define vascular pathologies in a Syrian golden hamster model of human COVID-19. The results show that regions of active pulmonary inflammation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are characterized by ultrastructural evidence of endothelial damage with platelet marginalization and both perivascular and subendothelial macrophage infiltration. SARS-CoV-2 antigen/RNA was not detectable within affected blood vessels. Taken together, these findings suggest that the prominent microscopic vascular lesions in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters likely occur due to endothelial damage followed by platelet and macrophage infiltration."

Treatment of localized DDCS is primarily surgical, though most patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease. Systemic treatment options for advanced DDCS are limited, and the benefits of chemotherapy in this patient population remain controversial. Among other systemic therapy options, there is emerging clinical evidence to support the use of immunotherapy in patients with advanced DDCS. However, studies regarding the efficacy of immunotherapy in advanced DDCS are limited. Here, we present the case of a patient with metastatic, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive DDCS treated with pembrolizumab who showed a sustained complete response for 24 months after initiation of therapy. To our knowledge, this case represents one of few documented cases of metastatic chondrosarcoma with sustained response to immunotherapy. The impressive response seen with PD-L1 inhibition in our patient indicates that immunotherapy is a successful treatment option in a subset of DDCS patients, and further investigation is needed to identify potential responders to immunotherapy."

        "abstract": "miR-206, miR-1a-1, and miR-1a-2 are induced during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts and promote myogenesis in vitro. miR-206 is required for skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo. Although this miRNA family is hypothesized to play an essential role in differentiation, a triple knock-out (tKO) of the three genes has not been done to test this hypothesis. We report that tKO C2C12 myoblasts generated using CRISPR/Cas9 method differentiate despite the expected derepression of the miRNA targets. Surprisingly, their mitochondrial function is diminished. tKO mice demonstrate partial embryonic lethality, most likely due to the role of miR-1a in cardiac muscle differentiation. Two tKO mice survive and grow normally to adulthood with smaller myofiber diameter, diminished physical performance, and an increase in PAX7 positive satellite cells. Thus, unlike other miRNAs important in other differentiation pathways, the miR-206 family is not absolutely essential for myogenesis and is instead a modulator of optimal differentiation of skeletal myoblasts."

Animal models of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) have been crucial in improving our understanding of this devastating disease and identifying biochemical pathways with therapeutic potential. The pathogenesis of NEC remains incompletely understood, with no specific entity that unifies all infants that develop NEC. Therefore, investigators rely on animal models to manipulate variables and provide a means to test interventions, making them valuable tools to enhance our understanding and prevent and treat NEC. The advancements in molecular analytic tools, genetic manipulation, and imaging modalities and the emergence of scientific collaborations have given rise to unique perspectives and disease correlates, creating novel pathways of investigation. A critical review and understanding of the current phenotypic considerations of the highly relevant animal models of NEC are crucial to developing novel therapeutic and preventative strategies for NEC."

        "abstract": "Reducing the age of first autism diagnosis facilitates access to critical early intervention services. A current \"waitlist crisis\" for autism diagnostic evaluation thus demands that we consider novel use of available clinical resources. Previous work has found that expert autism clinicians can identify autism in young children with high specificity after only a brief observation; rapid identification by non-experts remains untested. In the current study, 252 children ages 12-53\u00e2\u20ac\u2030months presented for a comprehensive autism diagnostic evaluation. We found that junior clinicians in training to become autism specialists (n\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203029) accurately determined whether or not a young child would be diagnosed with autism in the first five minutes of the clinic visit in 75% of cases. Specificity of brief observations was high (0.92), suggesting that brief observations may be an effective tool for triaging young children toward autism-specific interventions. In contrast, the lower negative predictive value (0.71) of brief observations, suggest that they should not be used to rule out autism. When trainees expressed more confidence in their initial impression, their impression was more likely to match the final diagnosis. These findings add to a body of literature showing that clinical observations of suspected autism should be taken seriously, but lack of clinician concern should not be used to rule out autism or overrule other indicators of likely autism, such as parent concern or a positive screening result."

        "title": "The Role of Stress Phenotypes in Understanding Childhood Adversity as a Transdiagnostic Risk Factor for Psychopathology",
        "abstract": "Childhood adversity is a leading transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, being associated with an estimated 31-62% of childhood-onset disorders and 23-42% of adult-onset disorders (Kessler et al., 2010). Major unresolved theoretical challenges stem from the nonspecific and probabilistic nature of the links between childhood adversity and psychopathology. The links are nonspecific because childhood adversity increases risk, through a range of mechanisms, for diverse forms of psychopathology and are probabilistic because not all individuals exposed to childhood adversity develop psychopathology. In this article, we propose a path forward by focusing on stress phenotypes, defined as biobehavioral patterns activated in response to stressors that can disrupt future functioning when persistent (e.g., reward seeking, social withdrawal, aggression). This review centers on the accumulating evidence that psychopathology appears to be more strongly predicted by behavior and biology during states of stress. Building on this observation, our theoretical framework proposes that we can model pathways from childhood adversity to psychopathology with greater specificity and certainty by understanding stress phenotypes, defined as patterns of behavior and their corresponding biological substrates that are elicited by stressors. This approach aims to advance our conceptualization of mediating pathways from childhood adversity to psychopathology. Understanding stress phenotypes will bring us closer to \"precision mental health,\" a person-centered approach to identifying, preventing, and treating psychopathology.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:It is challenging to conduct and quickly disseminate findings from in-depth qualitative analyses, which can impede timely implementation of interventions because of its time-consuming methods. To better understand tradeoffs between the need for actionable results and scientific rigor, we present our method for conducting a framework-guided rapid analysis (RA) and a comparison of these findings to an in-depth analysis of interview transcripts. METHODS:Set within the context of an evaluation of a successful academic detailing (AD) program for opioid prescribing in the Veterans Health Administration, we developed interview guides informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and interviewed 10 academic detailers (clinical pharmacists) and 20 primary care providers to elicit detail about successful features of the program. For the RA, verbatim transcripts were summarized using a structured template (based on CFIR); summaries were subsequently consolidated into matrices by participant type to identify aspects of the program that worked well and ways to facilitate implementation elsewhere. For comparison purposes, we later conducted an in-depth analysis of the transcripts. We described our RA approach and qualitatively compared the RA and deductive in-depth analysis with respect to consistency of themes and resource intensity. RESULTS:Integrating the CFIR throughout the RA and in-depth analysis was helpful for providing structure and consistency across both analyses. Findings from the two analyses were consistent. The most frequently coded constructs from the in-depth analysis aligned well with themes from the RA, and the latter methods were sufficient and appropriate for addressing the primary evaluation goals. Our approach to RA was less resource-intensive than the in-depth analysis, allowing for timely dissemination of findings to our operations partner that could be integrated into ongoing implementation. CONCLUSIONS:In-depth analyses can be resource-intensive. If consistent with project needs (e.g., to quickly produce information to inform ongoing implementation or to comply with a policy mandate), it is reasonable to consider using RA, especially when faced with resource constraints. Our RA provided valid findings in a short timeframe, enabling identification of actionable suggestions for our operations partner."

        "abstract": "ObjectiveWe analyzed the incidence of facial nerve sacrifice during parotidectomy for metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).Study designWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.SettingWe used our CSCC institutional database, which includes patients treated at the University of California-Davis from 2001 to 2018.MethodsWe evaluated patients who presented with biopsy-proven head and neck CSCC who underwent parotidectomy as a part of surgical treatment. We assessed the frequency of facial nerve sacrifice required in patients with normal preoperative facial nerve function with metastatic disease to the parotid. We evaluated the association between sacrifice and high-risk tumor variables using multivariate analysis.ResultsWe identified 53 patients with parotid metastasis and normal preoperative facial nerve function. Thirteen percent of patients required sacrifice of the main trunk of the facial nerve and 27% required sacrifice of a branch of the facial nerve. All patients who underwent facial nerve sacrifice had extracapsular spread (ECS). Perineural invasion (PNI) in the primary tumor (odds ratio [OR], 9.11; P = .041) and location of metastasis within the parotid body (OR, 6.6; P = .044) were independently associated with facial nerve sacrifice.ConclusionPatients with regionally metastatic CSCC to the parotid gland frequently require sacrifice of all or a component of the facial nerve despite normal preoperative function. The likelihood of nerve sacrifice is highest for tumors with PNI and metastatic disease within the body of the parotid."

        "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) with an infiltrative invasion pattern carry a higher risk of treatment failure. Such infiltrative invasion may be mediated by a mesenchymal-like subpopulation of malignant cells that we have previously shown to arise from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resist epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting. Here, we show that SCCs with infiltrative, high-risk invasion patterns contain abundant mesenchymal-like cells, which are rare in tumors with low-risk patterns. This cellular heterogeneity was modeled accurately in three-dimensional culture using collagen-embedded SCC spheroids, which revealed distinct invasive fronts created by collective migration of E-cadherin-positive cells versus infiltrative migration of individual mesenchymal-like cells. Because EGFR expression by mesenchymal-like cells was diminished in the spheroid model and in human SCCs, we hypothesized that SCCs shift toward infiltrative invasion mediated by this subpopulation during anti-EGFR therapy. Anti-EGFR treatment of spheroids using erlotinib or cetuximab enhanced infiltrative invasion by targeting collective migration by E-cadherin-positive cells while sparing mesenchymal-like cells; by contrast, spheroid invasion in absence of mesenchymal-like cells was abrogated by erlotinib. Similarly, cetuximab treatment of xenografts containing mesenchymal-like cells created an infiltrative invasive front composed of this subpopulation, whereas no such shift was observed upon treating xenografts lacking these cells. These results implicate mesenchymal-like SCC cells as key mediators of the infiltrative invasion seen in tumors with locally aggressive behavior. They further show that EGFR inhibition can promote an infiltrative invasion front composed of mesenchymal-like cells preferentially in tumors where they are abundant before therapy."

        "abstract": "Histone mutations occur in approximately 4% of different cancer types. In 2012, mutations were found in the gene encoding histone variant H3.3 (H3F3A gene) in pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and pediatric hemispheric gliomas. Tumors with mutations in the H3F3A gene are generally characterized as histone mutated gliomas (HMGs) or diffuse midline gliomas. HMGs are a rare subtype of glial tumor that is malignant and fast growing, carrying a poor prognosis. In 2017, the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Program appropriated $1.7 billion toward cancer care in 10 select areas. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) was granted support to focus specifically on rare central nervous system (CNS) tumors through NCI-CONNECT. Its mission is to address the challenges and unmet needs in CNS cancer research and treatment by connecting patients, providers, researchers, and advocacy organizations to work in partnership. On September 27, 2018, NCI-CONNECT convened a workshop on histone mutated midline glioma, one of the 12 CNS cancers included in its initial portfolio. Three leaders in the field provided an overview of advances in histone mutated midline glioma research. These experts shared observations and experiences related to common scientific and clinical challenges in studying these tumors. Although the clinical focus of this workshop was on adult patients, one important objective was to start a collaborative dialogue between pediatric and adult clinicians and researchers. Meeting participants identified needs for diagnostic and treatment standards, disease biology and biological targets for this cancer, disease-specific trial designs, and developed a list of action items and future direction."

        "title": "Evidence for a non-canonical JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the synthesis of the brain's major ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors.",
        "abstract": "BackgroundBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a major signaling molecule that the brain uses to control a vast network of intracellular cascades fundamental to properties of learning and memory, and cognition. While much is known about BDNF signaling in the healthy nervous system where it controls the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic-AMP pathways, less is known about its role in multiple brain disorders where it contributes to the dysregulated neuroplasticity seen in epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). We previously found that neurons respond to prolonged BDNF exposure (both in vivo (in models of epilepsy and TBI) and in vitro (in BDNF treated primary neuronal cultures)) by activating the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. This pathway is best known for its association with inflammatory cytokines in non-neuronal cells.ResultsHere, using deep RNA-sequencing of neurons exposed to BDNF in the presence and absence of well characterized JAK/STAT inhibitors, and without non-neuronal cells, we determine the BDNF transcriptome that is specifically regulated by agents that inhibit JAK/STAT signaling. Surprisingly, the BDNF-induced JAK/STAT transcriptome contains ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors coming from all the major classes expressed in the brain, along with key modulators of synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and axonal remodeling. Analysis of this dataset has revealed a unique non-canonical mechanism of JAK/STATs in neurons as differential gene expression mediated by STAT3 is not solely dependent upon phosphorylation at residue 705 and may involve a BDNF-induced interaction of STAT3 with Heterochromatin Protein 1 alpha (HP1\u00ce\u00b1).ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the neuronal BDNF-induced JAK/STAT pathway involves more than STAT3 phosphorylation at 705, providing the first evidence for a non-canonical mechanism that may involve HP1\u00ce\u00b1. Our analysis reveals that JAK/STAT signaling regulates many of the genes associated with epilepsy syndromes where BDNF levels are markedly elevated. Uncovering the mechanism of this novel form of BDNF signaling in the brain may provide a new direction for epilepsy therapeutics and open a window into the complex mechanisms of STAT3 transcriptional regulation in neurological disease."

        "abstract": "Most eukaryotic genes have been vertically transmitted to the present from distant ancestors. However, variable gene number across species indicates that gene gain and loss also occurs. While new genes typically originate as products of duplications and rearrangements of preexisting genes, putative de novo genes-genes born out of ancestrally nongenic sequence-have been identified. Previous studies of de novo genes in Drosophila have provided evidence that expression in male reproductive tissues is common. However, no studies have focused on female reproductive tissues. Here we begin addressing this gap in the literature by analyzing the transcriptomes of 3 female reproductive tract organs (spermatheca, seminal receptacle, and parovaria) in 3 species-our focal species, Drosophila melanogaster-and 2 closely related species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba, with the goal of identifying putative D. melanogaster-specific de novo genes expressed in these tissues. We discovered several candidate genes, located in sequence annotated as intergenic. Consistent with the literature, these genes tend to be short, single exon, and lowly expressed. We also find evidence that some of these genes are expressed in other D. melanogaster tissues and both sexes. The relatively small number of intergenic candidate genes discovered here is similar to that observed in the accessory gland, but substantially fewer than that observed in the testis."

        "abstract": "Single-molecule switching nanoscopy overcomes the diffraction limit of light by stochastically switching single fluorescent molecules on and off, and then localizing their positions individually. Recent advances in this technique have greatly accelerated the data acquisition speed and improved the temporal resolution of super-resolution imaging. However, it has not been quantified whether this speed increase comes at the cost of compromised image quality. The spatial and temporal resolution depends on many factors, among which laser intensity and camera speed are the two most critical parameters. Here we quantitatively compare the image quality achieved when imaging Alexa Fluor 647-immunolabeled microtubules over an extended range of laser intensities and camera speeds using three criteria - localization precision, density of localized molecules, and resolution of reconstructed images based on Fourier Ring Correlation. We found that, with optimized parameters, single-molecule switching nanoscopy at high speeds can achieve the same image quality as imaging at conventional speeds in a 5-25 times shorter time period. Furthermore, we measured the photoswitching kinetics of Alexa Fluor 647 from single-molecule experiments, and, based on this kinetic data, we developed algorithms to simulate single-molecule switching nanoscopy images. We used this software tool to demonstrate how laser intensity and camera speed affect the density of active fluorophores and influence the achievable resolution. Our study provides guidelines for choosing appropriate laser intensities for imaging Alexa Fluor 647 at different speeds and a quantification protocol for future evaluations of other probes and imaging parameters."

This monitoring is often the first step in early detection of pregnancy abnormalities, providing an opportunity for prompt, effective intervention to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Contemporary pregnancy monitoring systems require numerous devices wired to large base units; at least five separate devices with distinct user interfaces are commonly used to detect uterine contractility, maternal blood oxygenation, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and fetal heart rate. Current monitoring technologies are expensive and complex with implementation challenges in low-resource settings where maternal morbidity and mortality is the greatest. We present an integrated monitoring platform leveraging advanced flexible electronics, wireless connectivity, and compatibility with a wide range of low-cost mobile devices. Three flexible, soft, and low-profile sensors offer comprehensive vital signs monitoring for both women and fetuses with time-synchronized operation, including advanced parameters such as continuous cuffless blood pressure, electrohysterography-derived uterine monitoring, and automated body position classification. Successful field trials of pregnant women between 25 and 41 wk of gestation in both high-resource settings (n = 91) and low-resource settings (n = 485) demonstrate the systems performance, usability, and safety."

Studies of parenting infrequently examine both positive and negative discipline techniques despite use of inductive and physical discipline being inversely related to each other and to child externalizing problems. A burgeoning literature on the biopsychosocial determinants of parenting is identifying cognitive and physiological mechanisms underlying the initiation and regulation of positive and negative parenting techniques. This cross-sectional study of parents of preschool-aged children (N = 70; 89% mothers, 43% racial-ethnic minorities) advances the parenting literature by examining predictors of parents' inductive and physical discipline use across their cognitive functioning, cardiovascular psychophysiology, children's externalizing behavior, and their interactions with one another. No main effects or interactions predicted inductive discipline, but the interaction between parents' inhibitory control and nonverbal intelligence predicted physical discipline, such that parents who scored low in both domains endorsed the most use of physical discipline in response to child misbehavior. Another interaction between parents' sympathetic activity and child externalizing behavior also predicted physical discipline. These findings are discussed in relation to parenting interventions.

Concomitant with the increased incidence of infection has been&nbsp;an enhancement in the&nbsp;recognition of LD complications. Here, we report a case of Lyme carditis complicated by heart block in a pediatric patient admitted to our childrens hospital. What is unique about this case is that the complaint of chest palpitations is an infrequent presentation of LD, and what it adds to the scientific literature is an improved understanding of LD in the pediatric population. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 16-year-old male who presented with the main concerns of acute onset of palpitations and chest pain. An important clinical finding was Erythema migrans (EM) on physical exam. The primary diagnoses were LD with associated Lyme carditis, based on the finding of 1st degree atrioventricular heart block (AVB) and positive IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. Interventions included echocardiography, electrocardiography (EKG), and intravenous antibiotics. The hospital course was further remarkable for transition to 2nd degree heart block and transient episodes of complete heart block. A normal sinus rhythm and PR interval were restored after antibiotic therapy and the primary outcome was that of an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Lyme carditis occurs in <\u00e2\u20ac\u20305% of LD cases, but the take-away lesson of this case is that carditis can be the presenting manifestation of B. burgdorferi infection in pediatric patients. Any patient with suspected Lyme carditis manifesting cardiac symptoms such as syncope, chest pain, or EKG changes should be admitted for parenteral antibiotic therapy and cardiac monitoring. The most common manifestation of Lyme carditis is AVB. AVB may manifest as first-degree block, or may present as&nbsp;high-grade second or third-degree&nbsp;block. Other manifestations of Lyme carditis&nbsp;may include&nbsp;myopericarditis, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiomegaly. Resolution of carditis is typically achieved through antibiotic administration, although pacemaker placement should be considered if the PR interval fails to normalize or if higher degrees of heart block, with accompanying symptoms, are encountered. With the rising incidence of LD, providers must maintain a high level of suspicion in order to promptly diagnose and treat Lyme carditis."

Given the difficulties inherent to performing mechanistic biochemical and biophysical studies of membrane proteins in vitro, we previously developed a facile HeLa cell-based cell-free expression (CFE) system that enables the efficient reconstitution of full-length (FL) functional inner nuclear membrane Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) proteins (i.e., SUN1 and SUN2) in supported lipid bilayers. Here, we provide evidence that suggests that the reconstitution of CFE-synthesized FL membrane proteins in supported lipid bilayers occurs primarily through the fusion of endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes present within our CFE reactions with our supported lipid bilayers. In addition, we demonstrate the ease with which our synthetic biology platform can be used to investigate the impact of the chemical environment on the ability of CFE-synthesized FL SUN proteins reconstituted in supported lipid bilayers to interact with the luminal domain of the KASH protein nesprin-2. Moreover, we use our platform to study the molecular requirements for the homo- and heterotypic interactions between SUN1 and SUN2. Finally, we show that our platform can be used to simultaneously reconstitute three different CFE-synthesized FL membrane proteins in a single supported lipid bilayer. Overall, these results establish our HeLa cell-based CFE and supported lipid bilayer reconstitution platform as a powerful tool for performing mechanistic dissections of the oligomerization and function of FL membrane proteins in vitro. While our platform is not a substitute for cell-based studies, it does provide important mechanistic insights into the biology of difficult-to-study membrane proteins."

        "abstract": "Newly assembled herpesvirus nucleocapsids traverse the intact nuclear envelope by a vesicle-mediated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport for final virion maturation in the cytoplasm. For this, they bud at the inner nuclear membrane resulting in primary enveloped particles in the perinuclear space (PNS) followed by fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). While the conserved viral nuclear egress complex orchestrates the first steps, effectors of fusion of the primary virion envelope with the ONM are still mostly enigmatic but might include cellular proteins like SUN2 or ESCRT-III components. Here, we analyzed the influence of the only known AAA+ ATPases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the PNS, the Torsins (Tor), on nuclear egress of the alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus. For this overexpression of wild type and mutant proteins as well as CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was applied. Neither single overexpression nor gene knockout (KO) of TorA or TorB had a significant impact. However, TorA/B double KO cells showed decreased viral titers at early time points of infection and an accumulation of primary virions in the PNS pointing to a delay in capsid release during nuclear egress."

        "abstract": "The peripheral nerves (PNs) innervate the dermis and epidermis, and are&nbsp;suggested to play an important role in wound healing. Several methods to quantify skin innervation during wound healing have been reported. Those usually require multiple observers, are complex and labor-intensive, and the noise/background associated with the immunohistochemistry (IHC) images could cause quantification errors/user bias. In this study, we employed the state-of-the-art deep neural network, Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (DnCNN), to perform pre-processing and effectively reduce the noise in the IHC images. Additionally, we utilized an automated image analysis tool, assisted by Matlab, to accurately determine the extent of skin innervation during various stages of wound healing. The 8&nbsp;mm wound is generated using a circular biopsy punch in the wild-type mouse. Skin samples were collected on days 3, 7, 10 and 15, and sections from paraffin-embedded tissues were stained against pan-neuronal marker- protein-gene-product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) antibody. On day 3 and day 7, negligible nerve fibers were present throughout the wound with few only on the lateral boundaries of the wound. On day 10, a slight increase in nerve fiber density appeared, which significantly increased on day 15. Importantly, we found a positive correlation (R2\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.926) between nerve fiber density and re-epithelization, suggesting an association between re-innervation and re-epithelization. These results established a quantitative time course of re-innervation in wound healing, and the automated image analysis method offers a novel and useful tool to facilitate the quantification of innervation in the skin and other tissues."

        "abstract": "Background: Asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) consultations are a novel form of psychiatric consultation. Studies comparing patient and provider satisfaction for ATP with that for synchronous telepsychiatry (STP) do not exist. Methods: This mixed-methods study is a secondary analysis of patients' and primary care providers' (PCPs) satisfaction from a randomized clinical trial of ATP compared with STP. Patients and their PCPs completed satisfaction surveys, and provided unstructured feedback about their experiences with either ATP or STP. Differences in patient satisfaction were assessed using mixed-effects logistic regression models, and the qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis with an inductive coding framework. Results: Patient satisfaction overall was high with 84% and 97% of respondents at 6 months reported being somewhat or completely satisfied with ATP and STP, respectively. Patients in the STP group were more likely to report being completely satisfied, to recommend the program to a friend, and to report being comfortable with their care compared with ATP (all p < 0.05). However, there was no difference between the patients in ATP and STP in perceived change in clinical outcomes (p\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.51). The PCP quantitative data were small, and thus only summarized descriptively. Conclusions: Patients expressed their overall satisfaction with both STP and ATP. Patients in ATP reported more concerns about the process, likely because feedback after ATP was slower than that after STP consultations. PCPs had no apparent preference for STP or ATP, and reported implementing the psychiatrists' recommendations for both groups when such recommendations were made, which supports our previous findings.

A phase&nbsp;II randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 22-week study of immediate-release (IR) ralinepag safety and efficacy met its primary endpoint, significantly reducing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) compared with placebo. This phase&nbsp;II open-label extension (OLE) study assessed long-term safety and tolerability of ralinepag. METHODS: Participants were eligible for the OLE if they completed the parent study or experienced a clinical worsening event while receiving placebo. Those previously receiving IR ralinepag remained on their current dose, and participants formerly administered placebo were titrated to the highest tolerated dose. Participants were transitioned to an extended-release ralinepag formulation toward the end of the OLE. The primary objective evaluated long-term safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints included changes in 6-min walk distance (6MWD), World Health Organization/New York Heart Association functional class, clinical worsening, and hemodynamic measures. RESULTS: In total, 45/61 participants enrolled in the OLE study, 30 from the IR ralinepag group and 15 from the placebo group. The most common adverse events (AEs) were known prostacyclin-related effects (e.g., headache, 64.4%; diarrhea, 37.8%; jaw pain, 33.3%). There was a notable decline in AEs after reaching and maintaining a stable dose. At month&nbsp;24 after entering the OLE, 6MWD significantly increased by a mean of 36.3&nbsp;m (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.004) from OLE baseline, and most participants remained stable in their functional class (84.8%). Post-baseline PVR in 1 or 2&nbsp;years decreased by a median of 52.2&nbsp;dyn.s/cm5 and mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased by a median of 2.0&nbsp;mmHg (P\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.05). CONCLUSION: Ralinepag produced sustained, durable improvements in 6MWD along with durable reductions in PVR and a manageable AE profile. Most participants continuing treatment with ralinepag maintained functional measures throughout the OLE and those switching from placebo to ralinepag often experienced functional improvements."

The HAT domain of p300/CBP is a potential drug target for cancer. Through compound screening and medicinal chemistry, novel inhibitors of p300/CBP HAT with their IC50 values as low as 620 nM were discovered. The most potent inhibitor is competitive against histone substrates and exhibits a high selectivity for p300/CBP. It inhibited cellular acetylation and had strong activity with EC50 of 1-3 \u00ce\u00bcM against proliferation of several tumor cell lines. Gene expression profiling in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells showed that inhibitor treatment recapitulated siRNA-mediated p300 knockdown, inhibited ER-mediated gene transcription, and suppressed expression of numerous cancer-related gene signatures. These results demonstrate that the inhibitor is not only a useful probe for biological studies of p300/CBP HAT but also a pharmacological lead for further drug development targeting cancer."

However, resistance to tamoxifen occurs in many patients. ER still plays a critical role in the growth of breast cancer cells with acquired tamoxifen resistance, suggesting that ER\u00ce\u00b1 remains a valid target for treatment of tamoxifen-resistant (Tam-R) breast cancer. In an effort to identify novel regulators of ER\u00ce\u00b1 signaling, through a small-scale siRNA screen against histone methyl modifiers, we found WHSC1, a histone H3K36 methyltransferase, as a positive regulator of ER\u00ce\u00b1 signaling in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that WHSC1 is recruited to the ER\u00ce\u00b1 gene by the BET protein BRD3/4, and facilitates ER\u00ce\u00b1 gene expression. The small-molecule BET protein inhibitor JQ1 potently suppressed the classic ER\u00ce\u00b1 signaling pathway and the growth of Tam-R breast cancer cells in culture. Using a Tam-R breast cancer xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated in vivo anti-breast cancer activity by JQ1 and a strong long-lasting effect of combination therapy with JQ1 and the ER degrader fulvestrant. Taken together, we provide evidence that the epigenomic proteins BRD3/4 and WHSC1 are essential regulators of estrogen receptor signaling and are novel therapeutic targets for treatment of Tam-R breast cancer."

        "abstract": "Binding events that occur at different times are essential for memory formation. In trace fear conditioning, animals associate a tone and footshock despite no temporal overlap. The hippocampus is thought to mediate this learning by maintaining a memory of the tone until shock occurrence, however, evidence for sustained hippocampal tone representations is lacking. Here, we demonstrate a retrospective role for the hippocampus in trace fear conditioning. Bulk calcium imaging revealed sustained increases in CA1 activity after footshock that were not observed after tone termination. Optogenetic silencing of CA1 immediately after footshock impaired subsequent memory. Additionally, footshock increased the number of sharp-wave ripples compared to baseline during conditioning. Therefore, post-shock hippocampal activity likely supports learning by reactivating and linking latent tone and shock representations. These findings highlight an underappreciated function of post-trial hippocampal activity in enabling retroactive temporal associations during new learning, as opposed to persistent maintenance of stimulus representations."

To clarify the function of the REVEILLE 4, REVEILLE 6, and REVEILLE 8 transcriptional activators, we characterized the growth and clock phenotypes of CRISPR-Cas9-generated single, double, and triple rve mutants. We found that these genes act synergistically to regulate flowering time, redundantly to regulate leaf growth, and antagonistically to regulate hypocotyl elongation. We previously reported that increasing intensities of monochromatic blue and red light have opposite effects on the period of triple rve468 mutants. Here, we further examined light quality-specific phenotypes of rve mutants and report that rve468 mutants lack the blue light-specific increase in expression of some circadian clock genes observed in wild type. To investigate the basis of these blue light-specific circadian phenotypes, we examined RVE protein abundances and degradation rates in blue and red light and found no significant differences between these conditions. We next examined genetic interactions between RVE genes and ZEITLUPE and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5, two factors with blue light-specific functions in the clock. We found that the RVEs interact additively with both ZEITLUPE and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 to regulate circadian period, which suggests that neither of these factors are required for the blue light-specific differences that we observed. Overall, our results suggest that the RVEs have separable functions in plant growth and circadian regulation and that they are involved in blue light-specific circadian signaling via a novel mechanism."

However, the role of human BAT in plasma BCAA clearance is poorly understood. Here, we evaluate patients with prostate cancer who underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging after an injection of 18F-fluciclovine (L-leucine analog). Supraclavicular adipose tissue (AT; primary location of human BAT) has a higher net uptake rate for 18F-fluciclovine compared to subcutaneous abdominal and upper chest AT. Supraclavicular AT 18F-fluciclovine net uptake rate is lower in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Finally, the expression of genes involved in BCAA catabolism is higher in the supraclavicular AT of healthy people with high BAT volume compared to those with low BAT volume. These findings support the notion that BAT can potentially function as a metabolic sink for plasma BCAA clearance in people."

        "abstract": "The reduction of CO2 is known to promote increased alkene yields from alkane dehydrogenations when the reactions are cocatalyzed. The mechanism of this promotion is not understood in the context of catalyst active-site environments because CO2 is amphoteric, and even general aspects of the chemistry, including the significance of competing side reactions, differ significantly across catalysts. Atomically dispersed chromium cations stabilized in highly siliceous MFI zeolite are shown here to enable the study of the role of parallel CO2 reduction during ethylene-selective ethane dehydrogenation. Based on infrared spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy data interpreted through calculations using density functional theory (DFT), the synthesized catalyst contains atomically dispersed Cr cations stabilized by silanol nests in micropores. Reactor studies show that cofeeding CO2 increases stable ethylene-selective ethane dehydrogenation rates over a wide range of partial pressures. Operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectra indicate that during reaction at 650 \u00c2\u00b0C the Cr cations maintain a nominal 2+ charge and a total Cr-O coordination number of approximately 2. However, CO2 reduction induces a change, correlated with the CO2 partial pressure, in the population of two distinct Cr-O scattering paths. This indicates that the promotional effect of parallel CO2 reduction can be attributed to a subtle change in Cr-O bond lengths in the local coordination environment of the active site. These insights are made possible by simultaneously fitting multiple EXAFS spectra recorded in different reaction conditions; this novel procedure is expected to be generally applicable for interpreting operando catalysis EXAFS data."

        "abstract": "Psychosocial stress can affect cardiovascular health through multiple pathways. Certain stressors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage, childhood adversity, intimate partner violence, and caregiving stress, are especially common among women. The consequences of stress begin at a young age and persist throughout the life course. This is especially true for women, among whom the burden of negative psychosocial experiences tends to be larger in young age and midlife. Menarche, pregnancy, and menopause can further exacerbate stress in vulnerable women. Not only is psychosocial adversity prevalent in women, but it could have more pronounced consequences for cardiovascular risk among women than among men. These differential effects could reside in sex differences in responses to stress, combined with womens propensity toward vasomotor reactivity, microvascular dysfunction, and inflammation. The bulk of evidence suggests that targeting stress could be an important strategy for cardiovascular risk reduction in women."

        "title": "From primers to pipettes: An immersive course introducing high school students to qPCR for quantifying chemical defense gene expression",
        "abstract": "We created a 2-week, dual-module summer course introducing high school students to environmental toxicology by teaching them quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as a way to quantify gene expression of chemical defense proteins in response to exposure to environmental pollutants. During the course, students are guided through the various stages of a successful qPCR experiment: in silico primer design and quality control, total RNA extraction and isolation, cDNA conversion, primer test PCR, and evaluation of results via agarose gel electrophoresis or UV/Vis spectra. The course combines lectures, discussions, and demonstrations with dry and wet laboratory sections to give students a thorough understanding of the scope, utility, and chemical principles of qPCR. At the end of the course, the students are taught how to analyze qPCR data and are encouraged to discuss their findings with other classmates to evaluate their hypotheses and assess possible sources of error. This course was designed to be easily adaptable to multiple test species, chemical exposures, and genes of interest. To explore both terrestrial and aquatic toxicology, the students use honey bees (Apis mellifera) and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as test organisms, as well as ABC-type efflux transporters, antioxidant enzymes, and cytochrome P450 enzymes as endpoints for assessing gene expression. We share this course setup and applied protocols to encourage others to design and offer similar courses that give high school students a hands-on introduction to a broad swath of environmental toxicology research and an opportunity to develop scientific skills necessary for university-level research."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evaluation of biliary strictures primarily focuses on ruling out malignancy in older age groups. With endoscopic tools such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and cholangioscopy, improved biliary visualization has enhanced the investigation of intraluminal biliary lesions and provided modalities for targeted biopsies. Benign biliary strictures, however, may pose a diagnostic dilemma. CASE SUMMARY: A 71-year-old female with past medial history of hypothyroidism presenting for abnormal biliary imaging. Patients previous evaluation was concerning for common bile duct dilation with cholelithiasis, for which she underwent a cholecystectomy. Due to persistent symptoms and worsening liver function tests, she presented to our institution for further workup. Subsequently, the patient underwent an EUS and multiple ERCPs with cholangioscopy; biliary biopsies revealed no evidence of malignancy but concerning for prominent eosinophilic infiltration. After further review of multiple pathology specimens and the benign clinical course, we diagnosed the patient with eosinophilic cholangitis. CONCLUSION: Eosinophilic cholangitis is a rare disease and can present as a challenging case diagnostically. This case raises the potential utility of quantitative eosinophilic infiltration reporting in creating an objective diagnostic metric for eosinophilic cholangitis."

Since the Library continually monitors the curriculum, we seized this opportunity to connect with education leaders and re-envision Library content on evidence-based practice (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153EBP\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) at an even more developmentally appropriate place, earlier in the curriculum. Resultantly, we collaborated on a teaching session focusing on specialized information resources and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ask\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Acquire\u00e2\u20ac\u009d components of the EBP framework early in this new longitudinal thread on population health and evidence-based practice."
