    "abstract": "Twitter.com is a \"micro-blogging\" website. Although Twitter use is growing rapidly, little is known about health behavior discussions on this site, even though a majority of messages are publicly available. We retrieved publicly available Twitter messages during a 5-week period in early 2012, searching separately for the terms \"Pap smear\" and \"mammogram.\" We used content analysis to code each 140-character message, generating a separate coding framework for each cancer screening term and calculating the frequencies of comments. Using the brief account description, we also coded the author as individual, organization, or news media outlet. There were 203 Pap smear and 271 mammogram messages coded, over three fourths of which were from individual accounts. Overall, 22 % of Pap smear messages and 25 % of mammogram messages discussed personal experiences, including attending appointments, negative sentiment about the procedure, and results. Other messages from both individuals and organizations (8 % Pap smear, 18 % mammogram) promoted screening. About one quarter of the messages expressed personal experiences with cancer screening. This demonstrates that Twitter can be a rich source of information and could be used to design new health-related interventions.",

Towards this end, the law specifically mandates a 75% reduction of organic waste, including food waste (FW), from landfills by 2025. However, current infrastructural capacity to treat this diverted organic waste is limited throughout the state, so new facilities will need to be built to treat these valuable waste flows. The purpose of this study is to investigate ideal size and scale of new facilities that maximize FW treatment and minimize GHG emissions. To do so, this study uses a case study of Los Angeles County to model a decentralized network of small-scale, containerized anerobic digestors (ADs) for treatment of FW in the region. A spatial FW dataset developed for this study is used with a novel iterative-descent clustering model to simulate potential “FW-sheds” of ADs using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate a range of model results and a GHG analysis of FW collection is used to compare systems of two different AD capacities. The results of this analysis show that food waste is ideal for recycling at relatively small spatial scales as hauling burden of FW is reduced in these systems. The proposed infrastructure modeling approach is a first step of developing a zero net energy infrastructural solution that promotes a circular economy of food in direct response to SB 1383 and, more broadly, global climate change.",

Climate change contributes to an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires making smoke exposure a more significant and recurring health concern for individuals with airway diseases. Some of the most prominent effects of wildfire smoke exposure are asthma exacerbations and allergic airway sensitization. Likely due to the delayed recognition of its health impacts in comparison with cigarette smoke and industrial or traffic-related air pollution, research on the composition, the mechanisms of toxicity, and the cellular/molecular pathways involved is poor or non-existent. SUMMARY: This review discusses potential underlying pathological mechanisms of wildfire-smoke-related allergic airway disease and asthma. We focused on major gaps in understanding the role of wildfire smoke composition in the development of airway disease and the known and potential mechanisms involving cellular and molecular players of oxidative injury at the epithelial barrier in airway inflammation. We examine how PM2.5, VOCs, O3, endotoxin, microbes, and toxic gases may affect oxidative stress and inflammation in the respiratory mucosal barrier. We discuss the role of AhR in mediating smoke's effects in alarmin release and IL-17A production and how glucocorticoid responsiveness may be impaired by IL-17A-induced signaling and epigenetic changes leading to steroid-resistant severe airway inflammation. KEY MESSAGE: Effective mitigation of wildfire-smoke-related respiratory health effects would require comprehensive research efforts aimed at a better understanding of the immune regulatory effects of wildfire smoke in respiratory health and disease.",

    "abstract": "To advance ongoing efforts to diversify the healthcare field and promote inclusion in physiology education, the present study investigates the potential for an evidence-based intervention, Scientist Spotlight assignments, to highlight counterstereotypical representations of scientists in the context of majors and nonmajors physiology courses. Undergraduate students at an emerging Hispanic serving R1 institution completed six Scientist Spotlights assignments in their physiology courses. We conducted semistructured interviews and disseminated an established pre- and postsurvey protocol at the beginning and end of the courses. Our findings from interviews with 31 students from a range of marginalized backgrounds revealed that 1) the biographical information about counterstereotypical scientists deeply resonated with students by humanizing science, 2) the instructor's implementation of the assignments made a meaningful difference in their feelings of inclusion, and 3) the assignments supported students' beliefs about their content learning and understanding of physiological concepts. The results from the survey showed that regardless of being in a major (n = 159) or nonmajor (n = 117) course, students from a range of demographic groups can and do significantly shift in their relatability to and descriptions of scientists. We highlight implications for inclusive curricula like Scientist Spotlights for addressing the issue of representation in physiology textbooks, curriculum, and healthcare fields at large.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Scientist Spotlights significantly enhance undergraduate students' feelings of inclusion and learning in undergraduate physiology courses at an emerging Hispanic-serving institution. By engaging with assignments featuring counterstereotypical scientists, students in both majors and nonmajors physiology courses shifted in their relatability to and descriptions of scientists. These results suggest that an inclusive curriculum, combined with supportive instructor practices, can positively impact student success and representation in physiology education.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Challenging aortoiliac anatomy such as short neck and narrow access vessels is responsible for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) ineligibility in up to 50% of cases. The Ovation stent graft helped widen the range of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) suitable for EVAR thanks to its low-profile delivery system and polymer-filled sealing rings. However, its advantages are offset by a tight sizing chart that can lead to increased risk of type Ia endoleak or endograft infolding from under- or oversizing, respectively. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel endovascular technique developed to expand the use of the Ovation endograft while avoiding these issues. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent EVAR with the Ovation endograft at our institution between March 2019 and December 2020. \"Aortic Balloon Molding\" or ABM is a novel endovascular technique in which the graft is pre-cannulated and a compliant aortic balloon is inflated at the site of the graft's sealing rings during polymer administration. The technique was preferentially performed in patients with hostile neck anatomy (HNA) defined as any or all of angulation >60°, reverse taper configuration, ≥50% circumferential thrombus, or calcification. Patients undergoing traditional deployment were compared to those in whom ABM was performed. End points included neck-related adjunctive procedures, technical success, type Ia endoleak at completion angiogram, and 1-year freedom from type Ia endoleak and migration. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included in the study, of which 26 (60.5%) were treated with the ABM technique. Mean follow-up was 7.9 ± 6 months. Patients in the ABM group were more likely to have a reverse taper neck (61.5% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.1), have significant circumferential thrombus or calcium (23.1% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.1), and be treated outside of the Ovation indications for use regarding anatomic characteristics (65.4% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.1). Technical success was achieved in 100% of cases. However, patients in the ABM group were less likely to require a neck-related adjunctive procedure (7.7% vs. 23.5%, P = 0.1). Only 1 type Ia endoleak was observed at completion angiogram in a patient treated without ABM. At 1 year, freedom from type Ia endoleak or migration was 100% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: ABM proves to be a safe and effective adjunctive technique for the treatment of AAAs with HNA using the Ovation stent graft. This may allow optimal endograft sizing to achieve adequate seal in complex aortic anatomies. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this technique.",

    "abstract": "China implemented strict emission control measures in Beijing and surrounding regions to ensure good air quality during the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. We conducted synchronous aerosol particle measurements with two aerosol mass spectrometers at different heights on a meteorological tower in urban Beijing to investigate the variations in particulate composition, sources and size distributions in response to emission controls. Our results show consistently large reductions in secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) of 61-67% and 51-57%, and in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) of 55% and 37%, at 260 m and ground level, respectively, during the APEC summit. These changes were mainly caused by large reductions in accumulation mode particles and by suppression of the growth of SIA and SOA by a factor of 2-3, which led to blue sky days during APEC commonly referred to as \"APEC Blue\". We propose a conceptual framework for the evolution of primary and secondary species and highlight the importance of regional atmospheric transport in the formation of severe pollution episodes in Beijing. Our results indicate that reducing the precursors of secondary aerosol over regional scales is crucial and effective in suppressing the formation of secondary particulates and mitigating PM pollution.",

Using the history of the mass transfer of Armenian children during the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1922 as a case, this article argues that the study of child transfer and recovery is critical to both the history of human rights and a more sophisticated understanding of genocide, including the forms of genocide accompanying the colonial encounter. The experience of transferred children and their recovery or loss can help better clarify the historical relationship between the concepts of the rights of the child and individual human and minority rights as these have evolved before and immediately after World War II. Moreover, this article also contends that it is important to characterize child transfer as genocide, as opposed to colonial assimilation or acculturation as a feature of modernization, when explaining the broader social impact of mass violence, forced migration, and cultural destruction on victim/survivor and perpetrator communities. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Plaque psoriasis, which is the most common manifestation of psoriasis, is located on one end of the spectrum, dominated by adaptive immune responses, whereas the rarer pustular psoriasis lies on the opposite end, dominated by innate and autoinflammatory immune responses. In recent years, genetic studies have identified six genetic variants that predispose to pustular psoriasis, and these have highlighted the role of IL-36 cytokines as central to pustular psoriasis pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the presentation and clinical subtypes of pustular psoriasis, contribution of genetic predisposing variants, critical role of the IL-36 family of cytokines in disease pathophysiology, and treatment perspectives for pustular psoriasis. We further outline the application of appropriate mouse models for the study of pustular psoriasis and address the outstanding questions and issues related to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in pustular psoriasis.",

To test these hypotheses, we examined Stroop performance in 40 DSM-IV schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy control subjects, using a range of neutral stimuli (color patches, noncolor words, color words not in the response set). The findings confirmed several of our predictions and the results were consistent with the hypothesis that abnormal Stroop performance in schizophrenia reflects a failure to adequately attend to the task-appropriate stimulus dimension (color).

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein component of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and plays a central role in cholesterol metabolism. The lipid-free/lipid-poor form of apoA-I is the preferred substrate for the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). The interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 leads to the formation of cholesterol laden high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, a key step in reverse cholesterol transport and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. Knowledge of the structure of lipid-free apoA-I is essential to understanding its critical interaction with ABCA1 and the molecular mechanisms underlying HDL biogenesis. We therefore examined the structure of lipid-free apoA-I by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Through site directed spin label EPR, we mapped the secondary structure of apoA-I and identified sites of spin coupling as residues 26, 44, 64, 167, 217 and 226. We capitalize on the fact that lipid-free apoA-I self-associates in an anti-parallel manner in solution. We employed these sites of spin coupling to define the central plane in the dimeric apoA-I complex. Applying both the constraints of dipolar coupling with the EPR-derived pattern of solvent accessibility, we assembled the secondary structure into a tertiary context, providing a solution structure for lipid-free apoA-I.

As such, blueprinting represents a recent manifestation of regionalist approaches to environmental policy and planning. Focusing on the Sacramento region, an early adopter of blueprint planning, we use archival data and media sources to reconstruct the development of blueprinting and then we turn to an analysis of the performance of the blueprinting approach in relation to three successive planning efforts. We find that despite the promise of blueprinting, very little progress has been made toward actually changing the regional transportation system and land use patterns. The net result of this long-term planning effort aimed at achieving sustainable transportation land use is that total CO2 emissions increase over time at historical rates. We close with a discussion of what this means for regional planning and achieving goals set by California's landmark climate change legislation.",

In contrast to the psychoanalytic critical tradition, which presumes masculinity to be produced in conflict with women and/or femininity, I demonstrate masculinity to be a function not only of gender, but of age. The Winter's Tale explores the consequences of the early modern conception of boyhood as lying on a continuum with manhood, a conception reinforced by early modern views of the role of games in male development. I suggest that Leontes and Polixenes turn to games to affirm their connection to boyhood but that the drama problematizes this strategy by depicting these characters as collapsing boyhood and manhood, with pathological results. Whereas Leontes ultimately progresses toward normative early modern manhood—using recreation to recommit to his marriage and accept old age—Polixenes regresses, remaining fixated on youth and boyhood games. In this way The Winter's Tale questions as it produces a linear narrative of male development, folding back on itself to portray the cyclical nature of the aging process.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, behind only heart disease and cancer. With an estimated three million survivors of stroke in the United States, the cost to society, both directly in health care and indirectly in lost income, is staggering. Despite recent advances in basic and clinical neurosciences, which have the potential to improve the treatment of acute stroke, the general approach to the acute stroke patient remains one of therapeutic nihilism. Most basic science studies show that to be effective, acute intervention to reperfuse ischemic tissue must take place within the first several hours, as is the case with ischemic myocardium. In addition, most neuroprotective agents must also be administered within a short time frame to be effective at salvaging at-risk tissue. Recent studies have suggested that the outcome after intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage is improved with early intervention. However, most stroke patients fail to present to medical attention within this short \"window of opportunity.\" The public's knowledge about stroke is woefully inadequate. However, clinicians who deal with stroke can use the dramatic changes in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction over the last 2 decades as a guide for shaping changes in the management of acute stroke. Comprehensive educational efforts aimed at clinicians and the public at large have dramatically reduced the time from symptom onset to presentation and treatment for acute myocardial infarction, enabling treatment methods such as thrombolysis to be effective. The Decade of the Brain offers a unique opportunity to all concerned with the treatment of the patient with acute stroke to engage in a concerted effort to bring patients with a \"brain attack\" to specialized neurological attention within the same timeframe that the \"heart attack\" patient is handled. Such an effort is justified because, although at the present time there are few therapeutic interventions of \"proven\" value in the treatment of acute stroke, there is more than sufficient suggestive evidence that a number of approaches may be beneficial within the first few hours after the onset of the stroke.",

    "abstract": "This research provides a novel theoretical framework to explain the missing mechanism behind one of the strongest predictors for engaging in word of mouth (WOM): the consumer's psychological arousal (i.e., greater arousal leads to greater WOM; e.g., Berger, 2011). Across six studies (N = 1,309), we provide evidence for a motivational theory of the arousal–WOM relationship, highlighting the importance of the WOM's valence (positive vs. negative) as well as the consumer's salient type of arousal (energetic vs. tense; Thayer, 1989). In doing so, we demonstrate that consumers use WOM as an arousal management strategy: They are motivated to engage in positive WOM to maintain or increase their energetic arousal and to engage in negative WOM to reduce or eliminate their tense arousal. These findings also demonstrate the importance of the WOM recipient's response for the WOM source to achieve his/her desired arousal state. Thus, this work both expands our understanding of the arousal–WOM relationship and provides a framework for interpreting past work and conducting future investigations into when and how consumers will engage in WOM.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although family technical support seems intuitive, there is very little research exploring this topic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a subanalysis of data collected from a large-scale qualitative project regarding older adults' experiences in using health information technology. Specifically, the subanalysis explored older adults' experiences with technology support from family members to inform strategies for promoting older adults' engagement with new health technologies. Although the primary analysis of the original study was theoretically driven, this paper reports results from an inductive, open-coding analysis. METHODS: This is a subanalysis of a major code identified unexpectedly from a qualitative study investigating older adults' use experience of a widespread health technology, the patient portal. A total of 24 older patients (≥65 years) with multiple chronic conditions (Charlson Comorbidity Index >2) participated in focus groups conducted at the patients' primary clinic. While conducting the primary theoretically driven analysis, coders utilized an open-coding approach to ensure important ideas not reflected in the theoretical code book were captured. Open coding resulted in 1 code: family support. This subanalysis further categorized family support by who provided tech support, how tech support was offered, and the opinions of older participants about receiving family tech support. RESULTS: The participants were not specifically asked about family support, yet themes around family assistance and encouragement for technology emerged from every focus group. Participants repeatedly mentioned that they called their grandchildren and adult children if they needed help with technology. Participants also reported that family members experienced difficulty when teaching technology use. Family members struggled to explain simple technology tasks and were frustrated by the slow teaching process. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that older adults ask their family members, particularly grandchildren, to support them in the use of new technologies. However, family may experience difficulties in providing this support. Older adults will be increasingly expected to use health technologies, and family members may help with tech support. Providers and health systems should consider potential family support and engagement strategies to foster adoption and use among older patients.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In nature, obligate herbivorous ruminants have a close symbiotic relationship with their gastrointestinal microbiome, which proficiently deconstructs plant biomass. Despite decades of research, lignocellulose degradation in the rumen has thus far been attributed to a limited number of culturable microorganisms. Here, we combine meta-omics and enzymology to identify and describe a novel Bacteroidetes family (\"Candidatus MH11\") composed entirely of uncultivated strains that are predominant in ruminants and only distantly related to previously characterized taxa. RESULTS: The first metabolic reconstruction of Ca. MH11-affiliated genome bins, with a particular focus on the provisionally named \"Candidatus Paraporphyromonas polyenzymogenes\", illustrated their capacity to degrade various lignocellulosic substrates via comprehensive inventories of singular and multi-modular carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes). Closer examination revealed an absence of archetypical polysaccharide utilization loci found in human gut microbiota. Instead, we identified many multi-modular CAZymes putatively secreted via the Bacteroidetes-specific type IX secretion system (T9SS). This included cellulases with two or more catalytic domains, which are modular arrangements that are unique to Bacteroidetes species studied to date. Core metabolic proteins from Ca. P. polyenzymogenes were detected in metaproteomic data and were enriched in rumen-incubated plant biomass, indicating that active saccharification and fermentation of complex carbohydrates could be assigned to members of this novel family. Biochemical analysis of selected Ca. P. polyenzymogenes CAZymes further iterated the cellulolytic activity of this hitherto uncultured bacterium towards linear polymers, such as amorphous and crystalline cellulose as well as mixed linkage β-glucans. CONCLUSION: We propose that Ca. P. polyenzymogene genotypes and other Ca. MH11 members actively degrade plant biomass in the rumen of cows, sheep and most likely other ruminants, utilizing singular and multi-domain catalytic CAZymes secreted through the T9SS. The discovery of a prominent role of multi-modular cellulases in the Gram-negative Bacteroidetes, together with similar findings for Gram-positive cellulosomal bacteria (Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and anaerobic fungi (Orpinomyces sp.), suggests that complex enzymes are essential and have evolved within all major cellulolytic dominions inherent to the rumen.",

This study also tests whether perceived political dissimilarity of offline friends and family (core ties) and of more distant interpersonal associates (significant ties) encourages or thwarts political engagement and whether it moderates the influence exerted by online groups. As expected, political engagement among the analyzed respondents increases with online participation, also controlling for extremism, political discussion and news media use. Although dissimilar core ties neither encourage nor discourage political engagement, they moderate the mobilizing influence from neo-Nazi and radical environmentalist online groups. Dissimilar significant ties, in turn, do not directly affect political engagement and do not interact with online participation.

The Huisgen cycloaddition (\"click chemistry\") between the azide group and monoalkyne group led to formation of a triazole linkage between ε-polylysine and curcumin. The conjugation process was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Retention of functional activity of conjugated curcumin was evaluated by comparing the antioxidant activity of conjugates with native ε-polylysine using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. FT-IR spectra showed a significant decrease in the peak intensity of azide group of ε-polylysine (2102cm-1) and a concomitant presence of triazole peak (1459cm-1) after reaction with monoalkyne curcumin, validating that conjugation was successful. ORAC assay showed that the antioxidant activity of ε-polylysine-curcumin conjugate was 3.6 fold higher than control ε-polylysine indicating that conjugated curcumin retained its functional properties.

After noticing reporting heterogeneity in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we speculated that a standardized synoptic report could improve gastroenterologist comprehension. OBJECTIVE.—: To investigate the effect of a synoptic table on gastroenterologist comprehension of IBD pathology reports. DESIGN.—: We recruited gastroenterology fellows and faculty to participate in this study. All participants were given 6 pathology reports and asked if the following were present: active inflammation, chronic inflammation, IBD, and dysplasia. Participants were also asked to rate their confidence. After a 6-week washout period, the same questionnaire was distributed with a synoptic report. We performed paired t-tests to compare the mean accuracy and confidence scores between the preintervention and postintervention responses. RESULTS.—: A total of 39 physicians participated: 9 fellows and 30 faculty. Mean accuracy scores were higher after the intervention (0.81 versus 0.86; P < .001). Mean confidence was also higher after intervention, but this was not statistically significant (3.91 versus 3.98; P = .24). CONCLUSIONS.—: The improvement in accuracy scores after intervention confirms that clinician comprehension improved with the synoptic table. A synoptic report may provide a standardized way of communicating diagnostic information to clinicians in the setting of IBD and potentially other inflammatory conditions.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dating violence (DV)--physical, sexual, and psychological aggression in adolescent romantic relationships--is prevalent among youth. Despite broad calls for primary prevention, few programs with demonstrated effectiveness exist. This cluster-randomized trial examined the effectiveness of a DV perpetration prevention program targeting coaches and high school male athletes. METHODS: The unit of randomization was the high school (16 schools), and the unit of analysis was the athlete (N = 2,006 students). Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene, recognition of abusive behaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary outcomes explored bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Regression models for clustered, longitudinal data assessed between-arm differences in over-time changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes in 1,798 athletes followed up at 3 months. RESULTS: Intervention athletes' changes in intentions to intervene were positive compared with control subjects, resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12 (95% CI: .003, .24). Intervention athletes also reported higher levels of positive bystander intervention behavior than control subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, .38). Changes in gender-equitable attitudes, recognition of abusive behaviors, and DV perpetration were not significant. Secondary analyses estimated intervention impacts according to intensity of program implementation. Compared with control subjects, athletes exposed to full-intensity implementation of the intervention demonstrated improvements in intentions to intervene (.16, 95% CI: .04, .27), recognition of abusive behaviors (.13, 95% CI: .003, .25), and positive bystander intervention (.28, 95% CI: .14, .41). CONCLUSION: This cluster-randomized controlled trial supports the effectiveness of a school athletics-based prevention program as one promising strategy to reduce DV perpetration.",

In this paper, we draw on theories of technology in organizations to frame new directions for the study of what it means to work \"with\"AI. Drawing on prior literature, we consider how interactions between users and AI might unfold through theoretical lenses which cast technology as a tool and as a medium. Reflecting on how AI technologies diverge from technologies studied in the past, we propose a new perspective, which considers technology as a counterpart in a system of work that includes its design, implementation, and use. This perspective encourages developing a grounded understanding of how AI intersects with work, and therefore ethnography, building on thick descriptions, is an apt approach. We argue that relational ethnographic approaches can assist organization theorists in navigating the methodological challenges of taking a counterpart perspective and propose several strategies for future research.",

A major advance in the study of POPF is the fistula risk score (FRS). METHODS: We analyzed 48 consecutive patients undergoing PD. The \"Colonial Wig\" pancreaticojejunostomy (CWPJ) technique was used in the last 22 PDs, we compared 22 CWPJ to 26 conventional PDs. RESULTS: Postoperative morbidity was 49% (27% Clavien grade >2). The median length of hospital stay was 11 days. In the first 26 PDs, the PJ was performed according to standard techniques and the clinically relevant POPF (CR-POPF) rate was 15%, similar to the FRS-predicted rate (14%). In the next 22 PJs, the CWPJ was employed. Although the FRS-predicted rates were similar in these two groups (14% vs 13%), the CR-POPF rate in the CWPJ group was 0 (P=0.052). CONCLUSION: Early experience with the CWPJ is encouraging, and this anastomosis may be a safe and effective way to lower POPF rates.",

    "abstract": "While economic theory highlights the usefulness of flexible exchange rates in promoting adjustment in international relative prices, flexible exchange rates also can be a source of destabilizing shocks. We find that when countries joining the euro currency union abandoned their national exchange rates, the adjustment of real exchange rates toward their long-run equilibrium surprisingly became faster. To investigate, we distinguish between differing rates of purchasing power parity (PPP) convergence conditional on alternative shocks, which we refer to as “conditional PPP.” We find that the loss of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism after the introduction of the euro was more than compensated by the elimination of the exchange rate as a source of shocks, in combination with faster adjustment in national prices. These findings support claims that flexible exchange rates are not necessary to promote long-run international relative price adjustment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2012, nearly one-third of adults 65 years or older with Medicare discharged to home after hospitalization were referred for home health care (HHC) services. Care coordination between the hospital and HHC is frequently inadequate and may contribute to medication errors and readmissions. Insights from HHC nurses could inform improvements to care coordination. OBJECTIVE: To describe HHC nurse perspectives about challenges and solutions to coordinating care for recently discharged patients. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a descriptive qualitative study with six focus groups of HHC nurses and staff (n = 56) recruited from six agencies in Colorado. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a mixed deductive/inductive approach to theme analysis with a team-based iterative method. KEY RESULTS: HHC nurses described challenges and solutions within domains of Accountability, Communication, Assessing Needs & Goals, and Medication Management. One additional domain of Safety, for both patients and HHC nurses, emerged from the analysis. Within each domain, solutions for improving care coordination included the following: 1) Accountability-hospital physicians willing to manage HHC orders until primary care follow-up, potential legislation allowing physician assistants and nurse practitioners to write HHC orders; 2) Communication-enhanced access to hospital records and direct telephone lines for HHC; 3) Assessing Needs & Goals-liaisons from HHC agencies meeting with patients in hospital; 4) Medication Management-HHC coordinating directly with clinician or pharmacist to resolve discrepancies; and 5) Safety-HHC nurses contributing non-reimbursable services for patients, and ensuring that cognitive and behavioral health information is shared with HHC. CONCLUSIONS: In an era of shared accountability for patient outcomes across settings, solutions for improving care coordination with HHC are needed. Efforts to improve care coordination with HHC should focus on clearly defining accountability for orders, enhanced communication, improved alignment of expectations for HHC between clinicians and patients, a focus on reducing medication discrepancies, and prioritizing safety for both patients and HHC nurses.",

Nonetheless, it illustrates a dilemma that young men like him faced in the troubled years preceding Syrian independence: As French-educated young men, should they take their places as minor functionaries in the colonial machine and accept the promise of a comfortable and privileged life, or should they join the growing political and ideological struggle to found an independent, national statein Syria? Al-Arsuzi, who is venerated by the current regime in Damascus as the ideological father of Baʾthism, went on to answer this question by spending the next eight years in and out ofthe former Ottoman province of Alexandretta, working in support of the Arab-nationalist cause. Both his contemporary writings and later recollections of the period reveal a growing political consciousness and the formulation of a complex Arabism that was at odds with the dominant ideology emanating from the large cities of Syria. This ideology, as embodied by the National Bloc government in Damascus, was personality-based, hamstrung by European colonial interests, and unable to arouse any sustained political sensibility in the broader population; it centered its political legitimacy and parochial brand of nationalism on opposition to the French occupation. Al-Arsuzi and others, recognizing the weakness inherent in this form of nationalism, drew away from its leadership in the course of the 1930s and moved to create other, more radical and militant Pan-Arabist groups.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) has potential to reduce toxicity and facilitate safe dose escalation. Dose calculations with the planning CT deformed to cone beam CT (CBCT) have shown promise for estimating the \"dose of the day\". The purpose of this study is to investigate the \"dose of the day\" calculation accuracy based on CBCT and deformable image registration (DIR) for lung cancer radiotherapy. METHODS: A total of 12 lung cancer patients were identified, for which daily CBCT imaging was performed for treatment positioning. A re-planning CT (rCT) was acquired after 20 Gy for all patients. A virtual CT (vCT) was created by deforming initial planning CT (pCT) to the simulated CBCT that was generated from deforming CBCT to rCT acquired on the same day. Treatment beams from the initial plan were copied to the vCT and rCT for dose calculation. Dosimetric agreement between vCT-based and rCT-based accumulated doses was evaluated using the Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Mean differences in dose-volume metrics between vCT and rCT were smaller than 1.5%, and most discrepancies fell within the range of ± 5% for the target volume, lung, esophagus, and heart. For spinal cord Dmax , a large mean difference of -5.55% was observed, which was largely attributed to very limited CBCT image quality (e.g., truncation artifacts). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a reasonable agreement in dose-volume metrics between dose accumulation based on vCT and rCT, with the exception for cases with poor CBCT image quality. These findings suggest potential utility of vCT for providing a reasonable estimate of the \"dose of the day\", and thus facilitating the process of ART for lung cancer.",

Physical distancing from social contacts also created emotional distancing: it was harder to maintain affective connections via online platforms and within the isolating context of shelter-in-place. Due to emerging adulthood being a sensitive window for social development, the COVID-19 pandemic-induced emotional distancing could have long-term ramifications for this cohort's relationships over the course of their lives.",

    "abstract": "Low residential energy use is typically associated with undesirable characteristics, such as poverty, thermal discomfort, or small dwelling size. The association of low energy use with deprivation has been an obstacle to promoting more aggressive goals for reduction of residential use. However, there is little research on the composition of the low user population. We investigated the demographics, behavior, and satisfaction of the lowest 10% of electricity consumers in Sacramento, CA, to see what attributes best correlated with low use. California, like many other regions, has GHG emissions goals requiring drastic reductions in residential consumption. Households in Sacramento’s lowest decile of electricity consumption already live at electricity consumption levels consistent with the goals for 2050. Our investigation of 700 of these households found that diversity of low users with regard to age, income, education, appliance ownership, and dwelling characteristics is similar to that of the general population. Low-use households tend to be smaller, but not enough to explain the entirety of low usage. Surveys and interviews revealed that those in the lowest 10% typically pursued low consumption deliberately and enthusiastically and were aware of their status as low users. Conversations about energy conserving strategies were embedded in their social lives. They employed diverse and creative strategies to maintain thermal comfort without excess energy use, often exceeding expert recommendations. Finally, the distribution of self-reported quality of life was no different from that of the general population living at much higher consumption levels. Overall, the key determinants of low use were a positive engagement with improvisation and experimentation, and the salience of energy in personal or social life. The population of low users should be treated as a valuable source of peer advice and lifestyle modeling.",

Properly understood, in addition to the state of national affairs, presidential election outcomes are about the choice presented to the mass public.

Advocacy groups and patients identify family planning clinics as the preferred sites to lead PrEP implementation for women in the United States. However, limited qualitative exploration exists of U.S. family planning practitioners' attitudes toward integrating PrEP into their work. METHODS: We conducted qualitative focus groups with a convenience sample of family planning clinicians, counselors, and clinic managers to explore barriers and facilitators to PrEP provision in U.S. family planning clinics. RESULTS: We conducted six focus groups (total participants = 37) with respondents who worked in family planning clinics in San Francisco, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Key themes emerged highlighting how PrEP at times runs contrary to other family planning agendas, including efficient clinic visits, condom promotion, and long-acting reversible contraception counseling. Throughout these discussions, participants expressed discomfort with HIV vulnerabilities rooted in social and structural determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that those seeking to implement PrEP for U.S. cisgender women may benefit from exploring 1) how to integrate patient/provider conversations about the structural determinants of health and their relationship to HIV and other sexual and reproductive health outcomes and 2) how to foster person-centered prevention conversations in the context of busy family planning visits.",

The purpose of the present study was to replicate and extend findings on gaze avoidance in SAD via eye tracking during a computerized social simulation. Patients with SAD (n = 27) and a (sub)sample of demographically-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 22) completed a computerized, dynamic social simulation task involving video clips of actors giving positive and negative social feedback to the participant. All participants were unknowingly eye tracked during the simulation, and post-study consent was obtained to examine responses. Consistent with the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model of social anxiety, fear of positive evaluation related systematically to state anxiety in response to positive social feedback, and fear of negative evaluation related systematically to state anxiety in response to negative social feedback. Moreover, compared to HCs, SAD patients exhibited significantly greater global gaze avoidance in response to both the positive and negative video clips. Our results provide strong additional support for gaze avoidance as a biobehavioral marker of SAD, as well as additional support for the BFOE model. Implications for the assessment and treatment of SAD are discussed.",

We triangulate on these questions with multiple methods (longitudinal, experimental, and field studies), diverse population samples (MBA students, employees, and professional repatriates), and both laboratory and real-world measures. Using a longitudinal design over a 10-month MBA program, Study 1 found that intercultural dating predicted improved creative performance on both divergent and convergent thinking tasks. Using an experimental design, Study 2 established the causal connection between intercultural dating and creativity: Among participants who had previously had both intercultural and intracultural dating experiences, those who reflected on an intercultural dating experience displayed higher creativity compared to those who reflected on an intracultural dating experience. Importantly, cultural learning mediated this effect. Extending the first 2 studies, Study 3 revealed that the duration of past intercultural romantic relationships positively predicted the ability of current employees to generate creative names for marketing products, but the number of past intercultural romantic partners did not. In Study 4, we analyzed an original dataset of 2,226 professional repatriates from 96 countries who had previously worked in the U.S. under J-1 visas: Participants' frequency of contact with American friends since returning to their home countries positively predicted their workplace innovation and likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs. Going out with a close friend or romantic partner from a foreign culture can help people \"go out\" of the box and into a creative frame of mind. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Increasing situational awareness, identifying errors and near misses, and reporting them using organizational incident reporting systems enables mitigation of harm. METHODS: We designed and tested a brief, interactive, and easily replicable simulation activity for medical students, and emergency medicine interns and pediatric interns to strengthen their skills and enhance their self-efficacy in identifying and reporting patient safety hazards. Hazards fell into the categories of situational safety, patient identification and privacy, infection prevention, treatment errors, and issues with electronic health records (EHRs). RESULTS: The simulation training significantly increased the self-efficacy of medical students and interns in identifying and reporting patient safety hazards. Learners were very satisfied with the simulation training, successfully recognized key patient safety hazards, provided feedback to improve the training, and improved their ability to report hazards through organizational incident reporting systems. Patient safety hazards associated with patient misidentification were recognized most frequently, whereas safety hazards associated with EHRs were missed with the greatest frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation training enabled learners to identify hazards and near misses and enhanced their ability to report hazards through organizational incident reporting systems. Learners at all levels of training identified safety hazards at comparable rates, which demonstrates the role that trainees play in critically observing clinical settings with fresh eyes and identifying and reporting patient safety hazards. Interventions to promote patient safety need to prioritize building situational awareness of potential hazards associated with EHR use.",

This study explored the beliefs of older Chinese Americans toward colorectal cancer screening modalities, including fecal occult blood testing (FOBT). DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted 30 semistructured, open-ended, qualitative interviews in Mandarin and Cantonese, focusing on colorectal cancer prevention and health-seeking behavior. Participants were Chinese patients 50-79 years of age recruited from a community clinic in Seattle, Washington. RESULTS: When asked about colorectal cancer prevention, interviewees discussed such concepts as maintenance of positive energy (qi) and spirit (jing shen) and moderation of exercise and diet. Until prompted, participants did not discuss FOBT. Interviewees believed that colorectal cancer was caused by diets high in foods with \"heat\" (huo qi) or by intestinal toxins from frequent constipation. Participants presumed that FOBT is unnecessary in the absence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in our study expressed beliefs about health promotion and causes of colorectal cancer that differed from Western biomedical concepts. Failure to recognize these different beliefs may create inadvertent confusion among elderly Chinese-American patients. Health promotion programs to increase colorectal cancer screening must incorporate these concepts to improve cultural relevance among Chinese-American patients.",

Through qualitative interviews with firearm owners and enthusiasts, we identified key points for use in framing (identity as a gun owner, trust, voluntary and temporary storage, and context and motivation) and specific content (preference for \"firearm\" over \"gun,\" and legal issues such as background checks for transfers). These findings build on prior work and should enhance efforts to develop and deliver effective, acceptable counseling and-ultimately-prevent firearm suicide.",

Spouses are often the primary caregivers for people living with CMD, and understanding patients' and partners' conceptions of CMD could inform care. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 couples having a partner living with HIV and either hypertension or diabetes. Couples were recruited from HIV clinics in Malawi and were interviewed on beliefs around symptoms, causation, prevention, and treatment for CMD. Data were analyzed at the individual and dyadic levels using framework analysis and Kleinman's theory of explanatory models as a lens. On average, participants were 51 years old and married for 21 years. Approximately 57%, 14%, and 80% had hypertension, diabetes, and HIV. Couples endorsed a combination of biomedical explanatory models (beliefs around physical and mental health) and traditional explanatory models (beliefs around religion and natural remedies), although tended to emphasize the biomedical model. Half of couples believed stress was the main cause of hypertension. For diabetes, diet was believed to be a common cause. In terms of prevention, dietary changes and physical activity were most frequently mentioned. For disease management, medication adherence and diet modifications were emphasized, with some couples also supporting herbal remedies, stress reduction, and faith in God as strategies. Participants were generally more concerned about CMD than HIV due to poor access to CMD medications and beliefs that CMD could lead to sudden death. Within couples, partners often held many of the same beliefs but diverged around which etiological or preventive factors were most important (e.g., stress versus diet) and the best diet for CMD. Health education programs should involve primary partners to build knowledge of CMD and address overlap with HIV, and reinforce accurate information on lifestyle factors for the prevention and treatment of CMD.",

The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.",

    "abstract": "Consuming too much fat, sugar, and salt is associated with adverse health outcomes. Food reformulation is one possible strategy to enhance the food environment by improving the nutritional quality of commercial products. However, food reformulation faces many hindrances. One way to alleviate some of these hindrances is to embrace a multicriteria approach that is based on a market inventory. In this objective, additional sensory screening and water content analyses allow going beyond nutrition and composition information on the packaging. However, due to feasibility reasons for later in-depth analyses, it is necessary to work with several reduced and manageable products. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in the literature, there is no sample selection approach taking into account multiple criteria as a base for future food reformulation. The overall aim of this paper is to propose a method to select the best representative products from the market base, for future reformulation by going beyond nutrition and composition information on the packaging. This approach considered therefore nutrition, composition, economic, water content, and sensory information with the example of the cookies market. The first step is the creation of an extensive cookie database including sensory and water content information. In total 178 cookies among the French market were identified, then focus was placed on 62 chocolate chip cookies only. Sensory screening and water content analyses of all 62 products were conducted. The second step is to make an informed subset selection, thanks to a cluster analysis based on 11 nutrition, composition, and water content variables. A representative subset of 18 cookies could be derived from the obtained clusters. The representativity was evaluated with statistical uni- and multivariate analyses. Results showed a broad variety of chocolate chips cookies with a large nutritional, compositional, water content, and sensory differences. These results highlighted the first paths for future reformulation in this product category and showed the importance to include physical product information beyond the information on the packaging. This complete database on the selected cookies constituted a solid base for identifying future reformulation levers, in order to improve the nutritional quality and health.",

Infants remember the items they have attended to and perceived, and their emotional state will influence their perception and representation of the events they encounter. Moreover, by examining the development of the whole cognitive system, or the whole child, we gain a deeper understanding of mechanisms developmental change.

BACKGROUND: Surgical patch angioplasty, transcatheter stent therapy and intraoperative stent delivery are valuable treatment options for PA stenoses. The experience with intraoperative hybrid therapy has increased and new techniques and equipment have become available. METHODS: This study involves a retrospective review of 20 patients with a median age of 5.1 years who underwent hybrid PA stent therapy between March 2003 and April 2008. Thirteen patients had underlying diagnoses of either tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or truncus arteriosus. RESULTS: In 15 procedures, stents were implanted under direct vision. In 3 procedures, stents were implanted using vascular puncture with angiographic guidance, and in 2 procedures, stents were implanted using a combination of direct vision and fluoroscopy/angiography. Successful stent deployment was achieved in 18/20 (90%) procedures. One stent was malpositioned from the right ventricular outflow tract through a VSD, while another stent fractured as a result of high-pressure balloon expansion of a very resistant lesion. Adverse events were encountered in 3/20 (15%) procedures, which included the 2 \"unsuccessful\" stent deliveries. The median follow up thus far has been 1.7 years (41 days to 5.1 years). Seven of 20 (35%) patients required repeated interventions at the site of previous stent placement at a median interval of 8.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid stent delivery in the operating room, using either direct vision or vascular puncture, is safe and effective. Using a well-equipped hybrid operating suite facilitates safe intraoperative stent delivery in a wide variety of patients. Close cooperation between the surgical and interventional teams is essential.",

Patients vary in awareness of their depressive symptoms and ability to bring depression-related concerns to medical attention. OBJECTIVE: To inform interventions to improve recognition and management of depression in primary care by understanding patients' inner experiences prior to and during the process of seeking treatment. DESIGN: Focus groups, analyzed qualitatively. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixteen adults (79% response) with personal or vicarious history of depression in Rochester NY, Austin TX and Sacramento CA. Neighborhood recruitment strategies achieved sociodemographic diversity. APPROACH: Open-ended questions developed by a multidisciplinary team and refined in three pilot focus groups explored participants' \"lived experiences\" of depression, depression-related beliefs, influences of significant others, and facilitators and barriers to care-seeking. Then, 12 focus groups stratified by gender and income were conducted, audio-recorded, and analyzed qualitatively using coding/editing methods. MAIN RESULTS: Participants described three stages leading to engaging in care for depression - \"knowing\" (recognizing that something was wrong), \"naming\" (finding words to describe their distress) and \"explaining\" (seeking meaningful attributions). \"Knowing\" is influenced by patient personality and social attitudes. \"Naming\" is affected by incongruity between the personal experience of depression and its narrow clinical conceptualizations, colloquial use of the word depression, and stigma. \"Explaining\" is influenced by the media, socialization processes and social relations. Physical/medical explanations can appear to facilitate care-seeking, but may also have detrimental consequences. Other explanations (characterological, situational) are common, and can serve to either enhance or reduce blame of oneself or others. CONCLUSIONS: To improve recognition of depression, primary care physicians should be alert to patients' ill-defined distress and heterogeneous symptoms, help patients name their distress, and promote explanations that comport with patients' lived experience, reduce blame and stigma, and facilitate care-seeking.",

    "abstract": "Food insecurity is widespread among asylum seekers resettled in Western countries. Limited information exists on the quality of food intake in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate dietary quality among asylum seekers living in Norwegian reception centers. This study has a cross-sectional research design. Dietary intake was assessed through a qualitative 24-hour dietary recall, and the dietary diversity score (DDS) was calculated. This study was conducted in eight Norwegian reception centers. A total of 205 adult asylum seekers (131 men and 74 women) participated in the study. The asylum seekers ate on average two meals per day, and one-third ate their first meal after noon. Mean (SD) DDS was 4.0 (1.6) and 2/3 had low dietary diversity, eating from fewer than five food groups. Women had a significantly higher mean DDS (4.5) than men (3.8) (β (95% CI): 0.47 (0.00, 0.95) and a higher consumption of vegetables and fruits. The longer the period of residence in Norway, the higher the DDS, β (95% CI): 0.01 (0.00, 0.02). The asylum seekers' inadequate dietary intake reveals new forms of poverty and social exclusion in Europe. An inadequate dietary intake may increase the magnitude of difficulty involved in the settlement process and contribute to poorer health.",

The sociological literature on dementia care has primarily utilized the illness disruption and (bio)medicalization models to show how meaning and practices are negotiated in the non-expert setting. Instead, I apply a feminist labor process perspective to examine the question of why women dementia kin carers resist relinquishing care responsibilities to others. This qualitative grounded theory study is based on seven waves of interviews (total = 98) conducted over approximately five years with 15 Latina dementia kin carers recruited through clinic and community sites in Northern California. Findings show how Latina kin carers exercise a degree of control and autonomy over the care process because they have developed tacit knowledge and skills to craft quality care of kin. In facing the dilemma of ceding care to others they perceive as unprepared, they reject available help. This study reveals how carers maintain quality care with dignity and comfort for the care recipient and themselves.",

METHODS: This study is a subanalysis of a larger qualitative study based on interviewing patients with HF, their caregivers, and health care providers. This analysis included interviews with health care providers (N=20), focusing on their perceived usefulness of HF mHealth tools and interventions. RESULTS: A total of 5 themes emerged: (1) bio-psychosocial-spiritual monitoring, (2) use of sensors, (3) interoperability, (4) data sharing, and (5) usefulness of patient-reported outcomes in practice. Providers remain interested in mHealth technologies for HF patients and their caregivers. However, providers report being unconvinced of the clinical usefulness of robust real-time patient-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of assessments, sensors, and real-time data collection could provide value in patient care. Future research must continually explore how to maximize the utility of mHealth for HF patients, their caregivers, and health care providers.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE: HIV and cardiometabolic disorders including hypertension and diabetes pose a serious double threat in Malawi. Supportive couple relationships may be an important resource for managing these conditions. According to the theory of communal coping, couples will more effectively manage illness if they view the illness as \"our problem\" (shared illness appraisal) and are united in shared behavioral efforts. METHODS: This study qualitatively investigated communal coping of 25 couples living with HIV and hypertension or diabetes in Zomba, Malawi. Partners were interviewed separately regarding relationship quality, shared illness appraisal, communal coping, and dyadic management of illness. RESULTS: Most participants (80%) were living with HIV, and more than half were also living with hypertension. Most participants expressed high levels of unity and the view that illness was \"our problem.\" In some couples, partners expected but did not extend help and support and reported little collaboration. Communal coping and dyadic management were strongly gendered. Some women reported a one-sided support relationship in which they gave but did not receive support. Women were also more likely to initiate support interactions and offered more varied support than men. In couples with poor relationship quality and weak communal coping, dyadic management of illness was also weak. Partner support was particularly crucial for dietary changes, as women typically prepared meals for the entire family. Other lifestyle changes that could be supported or hindered by a partner included exercise, stress reduction, and medication adherence. CONCLUSION: We conclude that gendered power imbalances may influence the extent to which couple-level ideals translate into actual communal coping and health behaviors. Given that spouses and families of patients are also at risk due to shared environments, we call for a shift from an illness management paradigm to a paradigm of optimizing health for spouses and families regardless of diabetes or hypertension diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), there is growing evidence that racial/ethnic minority patients do not use portals as frequently as non-Hispanic whites to access their EHR information online. This differential portal use could be problematic for health care disparities since early evidence links portal use to better outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand specific barriers to portal use among African American and Latino patients at Kaiser Permanente, which has had a portal in place for over a decade, and broad uptake among the patient population at large. METHODS: We conducted 10 focus groups with 87 participants in 2012 and 2013 among African American and Latino Kaiser Permanente members in the mid-Atlantic, Georgia, and Southern California regions. Members were eligible to participate if they were not registered for portal access. Focus groups were conducted within each racial/ethnic group, and each included individuals who were older, had a chronic disease, or were parents (as these are the three biggest users of the portal at Kaiser Permanente overall). We videotaped each focus group and transcribed the discussion for analysis. We used general inductive coding to develop themes for major barriers to portal use, overall and separately by racial/ethnic group. RESULTS: We found that lack of support was a key barrier to initiating portal use in our sample-both in terms of technical assistance as well as the fear of the portal eroding existing personal relationships with health care providers. This held true across a range of focus groups representing a mix of age, income, health conditions, and geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study was among the first qualitative explorations of barriers to portal use among racial/ethnic subgroups. Our findings suggest that uniform adoption of portal use across diverse patient groups requires more usable and personalized websites, which may be particularly important for reducing health care disparities. This work is particularly important as all health care systems continue to offer and promote more health care features online via portals.",

Wherever they might put new housing, neighborhood groups spring up and oppose it. The same groups will have money to spend or voters to turn out at the next election. What’s a well-meaning city councilperson to do? Our answer: California’s “housing element” process provides a way forward. California requires cities to periodically adopt a state-approved plan, called a housing element, which accommodates the city’s share of regional housing need. These plans are reviewed and certified for compliance by the state Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). Cities across the state will adopt new housing elements between 2020 and 2022, guiding development for the next eight years. This process hasn’t always worked well in the past, but the legislature and HCD have recently strengthened the framework. There are now substantial political advantages for city officials to pursue pro-housing policies through their housing element, rather than through the normal municipal lawmaking channels.",

Caregivers’ approaches for handling these behaviors have implications for both care partners’ well-being. Yet the specific strategies that caregivers use in their daily management of BPSD are relatively unknown. This study used in-depth focus group data to examine family caregivers’ strategies for managing BPSD. DESIGN:: As part of a larger study (NINR R01NR014200), four focus groups were conducted with a total of 26 family caregivers of older adults with dementia. Caregivers were asked to describe the strategies they use to manage BPSD. Data from audio-recorded sessions were transcribed, coded to identify relevant concepts, and reduced to determine major categories. RESULTS:: Caregivers managed BPSD through: 1) modifying interactions within the care dyad (e.g., simplifying communication); 2) modifying the care environment (e.g., using written prompts); 3) activity engagement; 4) humor; 5) self-care; and 6) social support. CONCLUSION:: Family caregivers manage BPSD using strategies to minimize stress and address the needs of both care partners. Caregivers’ own accounts of these approaches reveal a window into their everyday management of difficult behaviors. The present findings generate key information for routine clinical care and targeted interventions to promote caregiver well-being.",

Men, aged 60 and older, were screened and assessed using standard instruments for clinical depression. Those meeting criteria were invited to participate in a 1.5 to 2.5-hour in-depth interview, in either English or Spanish. Interview data come from 77 men and included men with treated and untreated depression. Men linked depression to losing their economic role, sense of productivity, and familial respect. Their narratives of suicide highlighted central tenets of hegemonic masculinity. Men from both ethnic groups asserted that “being a man” involved strength and independent choice. For some men, suicide exemplifies these ideals; for most men suicide violates them. The majority of men who felt that suicide further violated their already fragile manhood either reclaimed a decisive masculine self or embraced a caring self, especially in relation to children and family. The latter pattern raises a theoretical question regarding the symbolic boundaries of hegemonic masculinity.",

    "abstract": "The combination of multiplexed mass spectrometry with photoionization by tunable-synchrotron radiation has proved to be a powerful tool to investigate elementary reaction kinetics and the chemistry of low-pressure flames. In both of these applications, multiple-mass detection and the ease of tunability of synchrotron radiation make it possible to acquire full sets of data as a function of mass, photon energy, and of the physical dimension of the system, e.g. distance from the burner or time after reaction initiation. The data are in essence an indirect image of the chemistry. The data can be quantitatively correlated and integrated along any of several dimensions to compare to traditional measurements such as time or distance profiles of individual chemical species, but it can also be directly interpreted in image form. This perspective offers an overview of flame chemistry and chemical kinetics measurements that combine tunable photoionization with multiple-mass detection, emphasizing the overall insight that can be gained from multidimensional data on these systems. The low-pressure flame apparatus is capable of providing isomer-resolved mass spectra of stable and radical species as a function of position in the flame. The overall chemical structure of the flames can be readily seen from images of the evolving mass spectrum as distance from the burner increases, with isomer-specific information given in images of the photoionization efficiency. Several flames are compared in this manner, with a focus on identification of global differences in fuel-decomposition and soot-formation pathways. Differences in the chemistry of flames of isomeric fuels can be discerned. The application of multiplexed synchrotron photoionization to elementary reaction kinetics permits identification of time-resolved isomeric composition in reacting systems. The power of this technique is illustrated by the separation of direct and dissociative ionization signals in the reaction of C(2)H(5) with O(2); by the resolution of isomeric products in reactions of the ethynyl (C(2)H) radical; and by preliminary observation of branching to methyl + propargyl products in the self-reaction of vinyl radicals. Finally, prospects for future research using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry are explored.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Explore how pediatric residents perceive the impact of a curriculum addressing racism on their knowledge, motivation, skills and behaviors, and investigate the contextual factors that promote or impede the curriculum's effectiveness. METHODS: Open-ended, semistructured interviews were conducted at 2 academic medical centers between August 2019 and 2020 among pediatric residents who participated in the curriculum. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Pediatric residents (n = 16) were predominantly white (66.7%), female (86.7%) interns (60%) from the Midwest (40%). Six major themes emerged describing the perceived impact of the curriculum on: knowledge - (1) Understanding of race and racism as structural forces in a historical context; motivation - (2) Owning the issue of racism, (3) Having the curriculum makes a statement; skills - (4) Critical self-reflection, (5) Perceived development of skills to mitigate biases; and action-planning - (6) Turning insight into strategies to combat racism and improve patient care. Two additional themes emerged describing contextual factors that promoted or impeded the curriculum such as the content of the curriculum itself, the racial demographics of the participants, the implementation infrastructure and environmental factors such as the culture of the training program. CONCLUSIONS: Medical education addressing racism can facilitate the perceived acquisition of foundational knowledge regarding race and racism; motivation and skill-building to combat racism; and action planning aimed at improving patient care. Contextual factors should be considered when developing and implementing such curricula to not only promote racial equity but avoid unintended harms.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physicians' fear of difficult patient interactions is an important barrier to discontinuing long-term opioid therapy. OBJECTIVE: To identify patient statements about opioids that indicate potential openness to tapering opioids or trying non-opioid pain treatments DESIGN: This is an observational study of regularly scheduled primary care visits involving discussion of chronic pain management. A coding system to characterize patient assessments about opioids, physician responses to assessments, and patient-endorsed opioid side effects was developed and applied to transcripts of video-recorded visits. All visits were independently coded by 2 authors. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six established adult patients taking opioids for chronic pain; 49 physicians in 2 academic primary care clinics MAIN MEASURES: Frequency and topic of patients' opioid assessments; proportion of opioid assessments classified as clues (assessments indicating potential willingness to consider non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses); physician responses to patient clues; frequency and type of patient-endorsed side effects KEY RESULTS: Patients made a mean of 3.2 opioid assessments (median 2) per visit. The most common assessment topics were pain relief (51%), effect on function (21%), and opioid safety (14%). Forty-seven percent of opioid assessments (mean 1.5 per visit) were classified as clues. Fifty-three percent of visits included ≥ 1 clue; 21% of visits contained ≥ 3 clues. Physicians responded to patient clues with no/minimal response 43% of the time, sympathetic/empathetic statements 14% of the time, and further explored clues 43% of the time. Fifty-eight percent of patients endorsed ≥ 1 opioid-related side effect; 10% endorsed ≥ 3 side effects. The most commonly endorsed side effects were constipation (15% of patients), sedation (15%), withdrawal symptoms (13%), and nausea (12%). CONCLUSIONS: Patient statements suggesting openness to non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses are common during routine primary care visits. Listening for and exploring these clues may be a patient-centered strategy for broaching difficult topics with patients on long-term opioid therapy.",

Similar inequities are seen in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mortality rates. In response, we sought to explore the intersections of racism and the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the daily lives and perinatal care experiences of Black birthing people. METHODS: We used an intrinsic case study approach grounded in an intersectional lens to collect stories from Black pregnant and postpartum people residing in Fresno County (July-September 2020). All interviews were conducted on Zoom without video and were audio recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to group codes into larger themes. RESULTS: Of the 34 participants included in this analysis, 76.5% identified as Black only, and 23.5% identified as multiracial including Black. Their mean age was 27.2 years [SD, 5.8]. Nearly half (47%) reported being married or living with their partner; all were eligible for Medi-Cal insurance. Interview times ranged from 23 to 96 min. Five themes emerged: (1) Tensions about Heightened Exposure of Black Lives Matter Movement during the pandemic; (2) Fear for Black Son's Safety; (3) Lack of Communication from Health Care Professionals; (4) Disrespect from Health Care Professionals; and (5) Misunderstood or Judged by Health Care Professionals. Participants stressed that the Black Lives Matter Movement is necessary and highlighted that society views their Black sons as a threat. They also reported experiencing unfair treatment and harassment while seeking perinatal care. CONCLUSIONS: Black women and birthing people shared that exposure to racism has heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing their levels of stress and anxiety. Understanding how racism impacts Black birthing people's lives and care experiences is critical to reforming the police force and revising enhanced prenatal care models to better address their needs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Violence against indigenous women and girls is endemic, yet the absence of research on the consequences of this violence from the perspectives of women presents a profound barrier to the development of knowledge, along with violence prevention and mitigation. Although family is central to many indigenous communities, existing research typically examines the consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) on women or children in isolation, rather than examining its consequences holistically. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to identify US indigenous women's perspectives about the impact of IPV on women, children, and families. METHOD: Data were collected with 29 indigenous women affected by violence from a Southeastern tribe in the United States. As part of a larger critical ethnography, pragmatic horizon analysis of life history interviews revealed the consequences of IPV across multiple levels. RESULTS: Women reported profound psychological consequences resulting from IPV. The majority of women had witnessed IPV in their childhood, providing support for an intergenerational cycle of violence. Women reported psychological consequences on children, which paralleled those reported by women, leaving deep impressions on children across their life course. Consequences on children and whole families were extensive, indicating the negative ramifications of IPV transcended personal boundaries and affected children and families across multiple generations. CONCLUSIONS: Given the tight-knit nature of indigenous families and communities, the consequences across individuals and families were noteworthy. However, a dearth in research examining consequences of IPV across levels fails to capture the interconnections of consequences for women, children, and families. Given the centrality of family in many indigenous communities, examining IPV from a holistic perspective that incorporates multiple levels is recommended for IPV research and intervention development.",

In addition to these technical analyses, in this article, we argue that structurally disadvantaged populations have a wealth of lived experiences that should be valued as lived expertise in the construction of transportation knowledge both for holistic understandings of actually experienced accessibility and in alignment with epistemic justice. Through Chicago-based focus group research, we find that individualized identities and community contexts combine in complicated ways that are challenging to fully capture in aggregated models. Findings also demonstrate that knowledge of inequitable accessibility and its ties to spatial inequities and the transportation system is common based on lived experience and results in continual adaptations among majority Black and Latine low- and moderate-income participants. Beyond the pragmatic need for lived expertise to adequately illuminate individual experiences beyond aggregated quantitative accessibility models, we argue a reframing to acknowledge lived expertise is critical on normative grounds for enhancing epistemic justice in transportation discourse.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vietnam is one of the fastest-aging countries in the world with a rising number of people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Families in Vietnam provide most of the care for persons living with dementia, yet our understanding of their experiences and needs is limited. This study examined the family caregiving experience in a semi-rural region outside of central Hanoi from the perspectives of family caregivers and other key informants. MATERIALS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 key stakeholders (12 family caregivers and 9 healthcare providers and community leaders). A descriptive, thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Qualitative data analysis revealed four themes related to the family caregiving experience: 1) perceptions of dementia symptoms as a normal part of aging rather than a disease, 2) caregiving as a moral and expected familial obligation, 3) patterns of caregiving that are heavily influenced by both gender and sibling order, and 4) multiple challenges or hardships, including time constraints, loss of income, increased social isolation, a toll on their perceived physical health, and emotional distress. Caregivers rejected the notion that caregiving was a \"burden\" and expressed their distress through terms such as frustration, sadness, and exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: In this low-resource setting, the stress of family caregiving may be amplified by lack of community resources, cultural stigma discouraging outside help-seeking, and economic impact of care provision. The study highlights the vulnerability and predicament of Vietnamese women who often face multiple challenges in their caregiving role as well as the urgent need for the development of community-based programs and supports.",

Habitual knuckle cracking also is a frequent source of questions for physicians, and the largest study to date reported an association with functional hand impairments. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) When compared with subjects who are not habitual knuckle crackers, do habitual knuckle crackers have greater QuickDASH scores, swelling, weakness, joint laxity, or ROM? (2) In subjects who crack their knuckles, does cracking immediately increase ROM? (3) What are the characteristic sonographic findings in joints that crack? METHODS: A prospective, institutional review board-approved study was performed on 400 metacarpophalangeal joints (MPJs) in 40 asymptomatic adult subjects. Of those, 30 subjects had a history of habitual knuckle cracking (defined as daily voluntary popping of MPJs). Clinical history provided by all subjects included a standardized QuickDASH questionnaire. Physical examination was performed by two orthopaedic surgeons (blinded to subjects' knuckle-cracking history and sonographic outcomes). The physical examination included evaluation for swelling, grip strength, and ROM before and after attempted knuckle cracking. Sonographic examination was conducted by one sonographer, with static and real-time cine images recorded before, during, and after MPJ distraction was performed by the subjects. Two musculoskeletal radiologists (blinded to subjects' knuckle-cracking history) interpreted the images for a definite hyperechoic focus during and after MPJ distraction; this was compared against the reference standard of an audible \"crack\" during joint distraction. RESULTS: Comparing subjects with knuckle cracking with those who did not crack their knuckles, there was no differences in QuickDASH scores (knuckle crackers, 3.7 ± 5.2; nonknuckle crackers, 3.2 ± 6.3; mean difference, 0.6; 95% CI, -3.5 to 4.6; p = 0.786), laxity (knuckle crackers, 2.0 ± 1.8; nonknuckle crackers, 0.3 ± 0.7; mean difference, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.5-2.9; p = 0.191), and grip strength (preultrasound, right hand, p = 0.499, left hand p = 0.575; postultrasound, right hand p = 0.777, left hand p = 0.424); ROM comparisons between subjects with a history of habitual knuckle cracking versus subjects without such a history only yielded increased ROM in joints that cracked during manipulation (knuckle cracking, 143.8° ± 26.5°; nonknuckle cracking, 134.9° ± 28.6°; mean difference, 9.0°; 95% CI, 2.9°-15.1°; p = 0.004). Swelling was not observed in any subjects, including when comparing MPJs before versus after distraction maneuvers that resulted in audible cracks. Immediately after a documented crack, there were greater ranges of motion with active flexion (preultrasound, 85.7° ± 12.4°; postultrasound, 88.6° ± 11.6°; mean difference, -2.9°; 95% CI, -5.1° to -0.8°; p = 0.009), passive flexion (preultrasound, 96.1° ± 12.4°; postultrasound, 100.3° ± 10.4°; mean difference, -4.3°; 95% CI, -6.2° to -2.3°; p < 0.001), passive extension (preultrasound, 41.8° ± 18.1°; postultrasound, 45.2° ± 17.6°; mean difference, -3.5°; 95% CI, -6.9° to -0.1°; p = 0.046), and passive total ROM (preultrasound, 137.8° ± 24.8°; postultrasound, 145.6° ± 23.1°; mean difference, -7.7°; 95% CI, -11.7° to -3.8°; p < 0.001). The characteristic sonographic finding observed during cracking events is an echogenic focus that appears de novo dynamically in the joint during distraction. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of immediate adverse physical examination findings after knuckle cracking. However, we did find a small increase in ROM among joints that cracked compared with those that did not. Future studies should examine if there are any long-term beneficial and adverse clinical outcomes associated with habitual knuckle cracking. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, prognostic study.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: In the aging brain, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on MRI are frequently presumed secondary to cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) or endotheliopathy. We investigate this association in vivo by quantifying protein cargo from endothelial-derived exosomes (EDE), and comparing levels between two groups of functionally normal elders with and without WMH. In addition, we study associations of EDE proteins with upstream and downstream factors, such as inflammation and neurodegenerative changes, respectively. Methods: Twenty six neurologically normal older adults completed general health questionnaires, neuropsychological and physical examinations, and brain MRI. WMH was visually graded with modified Fazekas score of 2 or greater used to classify 11 subjects as cases, and 15 without WMH as controls. Plasma total exosomes were precipitated and EDEs enriched by sequential immuno-precipitations. In addition, we quantified three inflammatory cytokines from plasma and imaging variables on MRI. Group means were compared, the discriminant functions of biomarkers calculated, and the association of EDE biomarkers with plasma inflammatory markers, cognition, and imaging outcomes assessed via regression modeling. Results: Plasma levels of EDE cargo proteins GLUT1, LAT1, P-GP, and NOSTRIN were significantly higher in subjects with WMH in comparison to those without. In contrast, EDE levels of the marker with low expression in brain (VCAM1) were equal between groups. The effect sizes for each of the brain-expressed cargo proteins (GLUT1, LAT1, and P-GP) were such that age-adjusted logistic regressions revealed areas under the curve (AUC) with range of 0.82-0.89, differentiating subjects with WMH from those without. VCAM1 poorly discriminated between groups (AUC:0.55). Higher levels of all brain-expressed EDE proteins were also associated with lower cognitive function, unrelated to burden of WMH. Levels of LAT1 and P-GP were significantly inversely associated with global gray matter volumes, and EDE GLUT1, LAT-1, and P-GP concentrations were significantly associated with systemic IL-6 levels. Conclusion: In a case control study of clinically normal adults with and without WMH, concentrations of EDE proteins were significantly higher in subjects with WMH in comparison to controls. This work is a first step toward in vivo dissection of molecular changes in endothelia of functionally normal subjects with radiographic evidence of age-associated white matter disease.",

Analyses of the construct validity of the scales provided a nomological network relating the Big Five to theoretically and socially important criterion variables, such as juvenile delinquency, Externalizing and Internalizing disorders of childhood psychopathology, school performance, IQ, SES, and race. These effects were obtained using diverse methods, including self‐reports from the boys, ratings by their mothers and their teachers, and objective‐test data.

Infants viewed eight pairs of objects, and their looking was recorded using their own webcam. Each pair contained one item with an easily graspable \"handle-like\" region and one without. Infants' duration of looking at each item was coded from the recordings, allowing us to evaluate their preference for the handled item. In addition, parents reported on their infants' motor behavior in the previous week. Overall, infants looked longer to handled items than non-handled items. Additionally, by examining the duration of infants' individual looks, we show that differences in infants' interest in the handled items varied both by infants' motor level and across the course of the 8-s trials. These findings confirm infant visual preferences can be successfully measured using Lookit and that motor development is related to infants' visual preferences for items with a graspable, handle-like region. The relative roles of age and motor development are discussed.",

Like Unamuno, I focus on the sonnets \"Redenção\" and \"Na mão de Deus.\" I first demonstrate how Unamuno unsuccessfully attempts to reconcile Quental's poetic descriptions of death as liberation, and of the individual's reabsorption in death into the universal consciousness, with his agonized faith in a personal God and his New Testament-derived belief in humanity's redemption from sin and salvation by Jesus Christ. I then argue that while Unamuno may have misinterpreted Quental, his misreading was nonetheless productive in that it furnished him with an Iberian exemplar of the sentimientotrágico de la vida – though I contend that Unamuno's elevation of Quental to the status of tragic exemplar is nonetheless misplaced</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "PROBLEM: Academic medical centers struggle with the high cost of care, reduced reimbursement, intense competition, and low profit margins. Many factors, including a high proportion of publicly insured patients, a model rewarding procedural specialties, and research and educational support burden, led to faculty salary inequities, physician disengagement, and difficulty recruiting. APPROACH: UC Davis Health implemented an aligned funds flow model in July 2021 to create a mission-aligned model in which all departments had financial margins to optimize recruitment, retention, research, and teaching. OUTCOMES: The 3-year experience (academic years 2021-2024) with this model at UC Davis Health was characterized by physician compensation, physician recruitment, and profit increases. Total collections for departments increased by 4% in the first year, 0.2% in the second year, and 11.3% in the third year of funds flow. Total productivity increased by 4.9% during the first year, 3.6% during the second year, and 8.4% during the third year. Salaries increased in all departmental categories in year 3. Productivity and collections per faculty member increased during the first year and were stable during the second and third years. Parity among procedural, primary care, and hospital-based service lines was improved because departmental revenue was agnostic to payer mix and hospital agreements were more formulaic. The hospital contribution to funds flow increased from $67 million in 2022 to $101 million in 2024. NEXT STEPS: Regular communication and transparency are critical to ongoing trust and success with implementation of sustaining funds flow. The new model resulted in improved physician compensation and increased hiring. However, the implementation of funds flow had a negative fiscal effect on the academic medical center, and sustainability may require fine-tuning to balance affordability. The authors plan to convert outpatient primary care to productivity-based models and decrease time-limited support for new faculty from 2 years to 1 year.",

Papers in this volume address key issues including whether or not our definitions of monogamy should change in order to better represent the social and mating behaviors that characterize wild primates; whether or not primate groups traditionally considered monogamous are actually so (by any definition); ways in which captive studies can contribute to our understanding of monogamy; and what selective pressures might have driven the evolution of monogamous and non-monogamous single female breeding systems.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cleaning staff in hospitals can spend an average of 10-20 min per day per patient room. Published literature shows a pattern of interactions between housekeepers and patients, and that they believe themselves to be a part of the patient care team. To date, no study about this phenomenon has been done in the United States or has framed them through the lens of patient care. OBJECTIVE: To describe the experiences and perceptions of hospital housekeeping staff in relation to patient care. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive. SETTING: A 625-bed tertiary, academic medical center in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Eight housekeeping staff participated, ranging from 40 to 62 years old, from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and worked at the study hospital from 4 months to 20 years. Interviews were conducted between September 2020-October 2020. Participants were recruited through flyers, email, and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured, in-depth interviews lasting 30 - 60 min. Data were analysed through thematic analysis using a 6-step framework that included data familiarization, generation of initial codes, search for themes, review of data, definition and naming of themes, and generation of a written report. Trustworthiness of the data was established through strategies such as reflective journaling, researcher triangulation and member-checking. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: 1) \"Here to take care of you\" 2) Difficulties & Coping: and 3) Perceptions of their role. These three themes provide insight into participants' perceptions of patient interactions and the kind of connections they formed with patients as they went about their duties. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that there exists among housekeeping staff a respect for the humanity of patients, a duty to protect people from disease, and a longstanding practice of engaging in therapeutic connections with patients. As noted elsewhere, there remains a disparity between the importance of this role and the recognition and dignity afforded it. These results reveal an opportunity to expand our understanding of who we call a caregiver, and to improve how we recognize and support each member of the healthcare team.",

Healthcare likely relies on the expertise and resources of community-based organizations to improve patients' social conditions, yet little is known about the referral process. OBJECTIVE: To characterize referrals to community-based organizations by primary care practices. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with healthcare administrators responsible for social care efforts in their organization. PARTICIPANTS: Administrators at 50 diverse US healthcare organizations with efforts to address patients' social risks. MAIN MEASURES: Approaches used in primary care to implement social needs referral to community-based organizations. RESULTS: Interviewed administrators reported that social needs referrals were an essential element in their social care activities. Administrators described the ideal referral programs as placing limited burden on care teams, providing patients with customized referrals, and facilitating closed-loop referrals. We identified three key challenges organizations experience when trying to implement the ideal referrals program: (1) developing and maintaining resources lists; (2) aligning referrals with patient needs; and (3) measuring the efficacy of referrals. Collectively, these challenges led to organizations relying on staff to manually develop and update resource lists and, in most cases, provide patients with generic referrals. Administrators not only hoped that referral platforms may help overcome some of these barriers, but also reported implementation challenges with platforms including inconsistent buy-in and use across staff; integration with electronic health records; management and prioritization of resources; and alignment with other organizations in their market. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Referrals to community-based organizations were used in primary care to improve patients' social conditions, but despite strong motivations, interviewees reported challenges providing tailored and up-to-date information to patients.",

In attending to the intersection between games and theatre, I participate in a long tradition of performance studies scholarship. But in contrast to much of this scholarship, I emphasize the formal qualities of particular gameswhich vary widely from one game to anotherarguing that different games call for unique competencies in players and in spectators of games. 3 Arden of Faversham reflects on spatial relations in the early modern theatre by staging and enacting the ludic competencies peculiar to backgammon. © 2012 American Society for Theatre Research.",

However, functional neuroimaging measures of neural noise may be vulnerable to contamination by recording noise. This study explored variability of electrophysiological responses to tones of different intensities in 127 autistic and 79 typically-developing children aged 2-5 years old. A rigorous data processing pipeline, including advanced visualizations of different signal sources that were maximally independent across different time lags, was used to identify and eliminate putative recording noise. Inter-trial variability was measured using median absolute deviations (MADs) of EEG amplitudes across trials and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC). ITPC was elevated in autism in the 50 and 60 dB intensity conditions, suggesting diminished (rather than elevated) neural noise in autism, although reduced ITPC to soft 50 dB sounds was associated with increased loudness discomfort. Autistic and non-autistic participants did not differ in MADs, and indeed, the vast majority of the statistical tests examined in this study yielded no significant effects. These results appear inconsistent with the neural noise account.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Until December 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration impeded abortion access by restricting pharmacists from dispensing mifepristone, one of two drugs used in medication abortion. This study aimed to explore pharmacists' perspectives on dispensing mifepristone. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with pharmacists before and after participating in a pilot project where mifepristone was dispensed from their pharmacies. We thematically coded all interview transcripts, then summarized emergent themes related to pharmacists' support, comfort, experiences, and concerns around dispensing mifepristone. RESULTS: Between May 2018 and July 2020, we interviewed 29 pharmacists (22 at baseline and 15 at follow-up, with 8 completing both interviews) from 5 pharmacies. At both baseline and follow-up, interviewees strongly supported pharmacists dispensing mifepristone, feeling it would improve quality of care by providing more convenient medication abortion access and streamlined service delivery and take advantage of pharmacists' expertise and availability. All pharmacists interviewed at follow-up reported dispensing mifepristone except two who were willing but did not have the opportunity. Pharmacists experienced few challenges dispensing mifepristone. Their main concern was perceived discomfort that other pharmacists and pharmacy staff may experience, particularly in conservative areas or small pharmacies where pharmacists' refusal to dispense mifepristone could impede abortion access. CONCLUSIONS: Most pharmacists supported dispensing mifepristone and were comfortable doing so after education on mifepristone and medication abortion. They dispensed mifepristone without difficulty, in a similar process as dispensing other medications. With the recent removal of U.S. Food and Drug Administration restrictions prohibiting it, our findings support the feasibility of pharmacists dispensing mifepristone.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Scholarship is a requirement of residency training; however, the scholarly productivity of trainees is highly variable. The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of residents who have been highly productive in scholarship. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study using a constructivist-interpretivist paradigm and conducted semistructured interviews at seven Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited emergency medicine residency programs in the United States. We included sites of diverse locations and training formats (PGY-1 to -4 vs. PGY-1 to -3). Program leadership identified residents with high levels of scholarly productivity at their institutions. We used purposive sampling to seek out residents with diversity in gender and PGY level. Two researchers independently performed a thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Discrepancies were resolved through in-depth discussion and negotiated consensus. RESULTS: We invited 14 residents and all consented to be interviewed. Residents felt scholarship enhanced their knowledge and skills, grew collaborative networks, and provided personal fulfillment and external rewards. Scholarship positively impacted their careers by focusing their professional interests and informing career decisions. Participants identified individual and institutional facilitators of success including personal prior knowledge and skills, project management skills, mindset, protected time, mentorship, and leadership support. Challenges to conducting scholarship included lack of time, expertise, and resources. Participants acknowledged that participating in scholarly activities was hard work and recommended that residents seek out quality mentorship, work on projects that they are passionate, start early, and be persistent in their efforts. Participants' advice to faculty supporting resident scholarship included recommendations to allow resident autonomy of projects, provide scholarly opportunities, and be responsive to trainee needs. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this study highlighted benefits of participating in scholarly activity as well as challenges and strategies for success. These results can inform residencies seeking to enhance the scholarly experience of trainees.",

    "abstract": "Micellar nanoparticles based on linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) block dendritic cholic acids (CA) copolymers (telodendrimers), for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of cancers, are reported. The micellar nanoparticles have been decorated with a high-affinity \"OA02\" peptide against α-3 integrin receptor to improve the tumor-targeting specificity which is overexpressed on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. \"Click chemistry\" was used to conjugate alkyne-containing OA02 peptide to the azide group at the distal terminus of the PEG chain in a representative PEG(5k)-CA(8) telodendrimer (micelle-forming unit). The conjugation of OA02 peptide had negligible influence on the physicochemical properties of PEG(5k)-CA(8) nanoparticles and as hypothesized, OA02 peptide dramatically enhanced the uptake efficiency of PEG(5k)-CA(8) nanoparticles (NP) in SKOV-3 and ES-2 ovarian cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, but not in α-3 integrin-negative K562 leukemia cells. When loaded with paclitaxel, OA02-NPs had significantly higher in vitro cytotoxicity against both SKOV-3 and ES-2 ovarian cancer cells as compared with nontargeted nanoparticles. Furthermore, the in vivo biodistribution study showed OA02 peptide greatly facilitated tumor localization and the intracellular uptake of PEG(5k)-CA(8) nanoparticles into ovarian cancer cells as validated in SKOV3-luc tumor-bearing mice. Finally, paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded OA02-NPs exhibited superior antitumor efficacy and lower systemic toxicity profile in nude mice bearing SKOV-3 tumor xenografts, when compared with equivalent doses of nontargeted PTX-NPs as well as clinical paclitaxel formulation (Taxol). Therefore, OA02-targeted telodendrimers loaded with paclitaxel have great potential as a new therapeutic approach for patients with ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticle-based theranostic agents have emerged as a new paradigm in nanomedicine field for integration of multimodal imaging and therapeutic functions within a single platform. However, the clinical translation of these agents is severely limited by the complexity of fabrication, long-term toxicity of the materials, and unfavorable biodistributions. Here we report an extremely simple and robust approach to develop highly versatile and biocompatible theranostic poly(vinyl alcohol)-porphyrin nanoparticles (PPNs). Through a \"one-pot\" fabrication process, including the chelation of metal ions and encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs, monodispersenanoparticle could be formed by self-assembly of a very simple and biocompatible building block (poly(vinyl alcohol)-porphyrin conjugate). Using this approach, we could conveniently produce multifunctional PPNs that integrate optical imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT) and drug delivery functions in one formulation. PPNs exhibited unique architecture-dependent fluorescence self-quenching, as well as photodynamic- and photothermal- properties. Near-infrared fluorescence could be amplified upon PPN dissociation, providing feasibility of low-background fluorescence imaging. Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded PPNs achieved 53 times longer half-life in blood circulation than free DOX. Upon irradiation by near infrared light at a single excitation wavelength, PPNs could be activated to release reactive oxygen species, heat and drugs simultaneously at the tumor sites in mice bearing tumor xenograft, resulting in complete eradication of tumors. Due to their organic compositions, PPNs showed no obvious cytotoxicity in mice via intravenous administration during therapeutic studies. This highly versatile and multifunctional PPN theranostic nanoplatform showed great potential for the integration of multimodal imaging and therapeutic functions towards personalized nanomedicine against cancers.",

We used a recently developed two-photon microscopy method, based on a novel phosphorescent nanoprobe, to image tissue oxygenation in the rat primary sensory cortex in response to sensory stimulation. Our measurements showed that a stimulus-evoked increase in tissue pO₂ depended on the baseline pO₂ level. In particular, during sustained stimulation, the steady-state pO₂ at low-baseline locations remained at the baseline, despite large pO₂ increases elsewhere. In contrast to the steady state, where pO₂ never decreased below the baseline, transient decreases occurred during the \"initial dip\" and \"poststimulus undershoot.\" These results suggest that the increase in blood oxygenation during the hemodynamic response, which has been perceived as a paradox, may serve to prevent a sustained oxygenation drop at tissue locations that are remote from the vascular feeding sources.",

    "abstract": "Intravitreal administration for human adeno-associated vector (AAV) delivery is easier and less traumatic to ocular tissues than subretinal injection, but it gives limited retinal transduction. AAV vectors are large (about 4,000 kDa) compared with most intraocular drugs, such as ranibizumab (48 kDa), and the large size impedes diffusion to reach the retina from the usual injection site in the anterior/mid-vitreous. Intuitively, a preferred placement for the vector would be deep in the vitreous near the retina, which we term \"para-retinal\" delivery. We explored the consequences of para-retinal intravitreal delivery in the rabbit eye and in non-human primate (NHP) eye. 1 h after para-retinal administration in the rabbit eye, the vector concentration near the retina remained four times greater than in the anterior vitreous, indicating limited vector diffusion through the gelatinous vitreous matrix. In NHP, para-retinal placement showed greater transduction in the fovea than vector applied in the mid-vitreous. More efficient retinal delivery translates to using lower vector doses, with reduced risk of ocular inflammatory exposure. These results indicate that para-retinal delivery yields more effective vector concentration near the retina, thereby increasing the potential for better retinal transduction in human clinical application.",

The physicochemical and immunomodulatory properties of milks fermented with L. paracasei CIDCA8339, CIDCA83123 and CIDCA83124 were analyzed. The three strains produced bioactive metabolites during fermentation, since the fermented milk supernatants were able to downregulate >75% of the induced innate immune response in vitro. Although all strains presented absence of hemolytic activity and susceptibility to antibiotics, L. paracasei CIDCA8339 presented more attractive probiotic and technological properties. Mice consuming the fermented milk with L. paracasei CIDCA 8339 did not present significant modifications in sIgA levels or TNF-α, TGF-β and IL-10 mRNA expression in ileum. Additionally, a decrease of INF-γ level in ileum and no microbiological translocation to liver and spleen was observed. These results demonstrate that L. paracasei CIDCA8339 represents a safe promising potential probiotic strain for the development of functional foods.",

We propose a method for variable selection that first estimates the regression function, yielding a \" preconditioned\" response variable. The primary method used for this initial regression is supervised principal components. Then we apply a standard procedure such as forward stepwise selection or the LASSO to the preconditioned response variable. In a number of simulated and real data examples, this two-step procedure outperforms forward stepwise selection or the usual LASSO (applied directly to the raw outcome). We also show that under a certain Gaussian latent variable model, application of the LASSO to the preconditioned response variable is consistent as the number of predictors and observations increases. Moreover, when the observational noise is rather large, the suggested procedure can give a more accurate estimate than LASSO. We illustrate our method on some real problems, including survival analysis with microarray data. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2008.",

    "abstract": "Relative submergence of macroroughness elements such as boulders and bedrock outcrops, or large bed elements (LBEs), collectively, is a primary control on hydraulics and morphodynamics in steep, coarse-bedded rivers. However, in practice, the property is typically represented by singular, often reach- or cross-section-averaged values that mask bed-surface heterogeneity and joint distributions of local flow depths. By coupling sub-meter resolution two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic modeling with spatially explicit mapping of LBEs from a 13.2 km segment of a boulder-bedded mountain river, we present complete distributions of LBE relative submergences at multiple spatial scales and explore their dynamism across discharges. Through distribution fitting and statistical analysis of resultant discharge-dependent LBE relative submergence datasets, it was confirmed that segment- and reach-scale datasets exhibited similar statistical properties and were able to be drawn from the same type of distribution. Further, the rate at which statistical and parametric properties changed between discharge-dependent datasets were statistically equivalent between spatial domains, which we term “process-based similarity”. Commonality in distribution type and the uniform between discharge–scaling relationships suggest mutual self-organizing processes associated with the size-frequency distribution, spatial arrangement, and submergence of LBEs were present between most domains.",

While Virgil and Dryden both had political reasons to be invested in patrilineage, their shared interest in Epicureanism, with its denial of life after death, may have driven these poets to search for an alternative form of immortality in reproduction. Dryden’s choices as a translator reveal cultural anxieties around women’s role in procreation and suggest a preference for adoption as a model for reproductive success because it allows women to be cut out of the process. Ultimately, Aeneas’ decision to identify with his deceased, adopted son rather than his living biological son in the poem’s final lines suggests a turning away from futurity and acceptance of death.</jats:p>",

Despite its widespread use, the cognitive mechanisms underlying the Eyes Test are still unclear. We propose that top-down visual attention will result in better performance on the Eyes Test. Seventy-four female participants completed the Eyes Test in conjunction with three congruency tasks, including the flanker, number Stroop, and Navon’s global-local tasks. According to the hypothesis, the Eyes Test scores were found to be negatively associated with the response congruency effects—the difference in performance between congruent and incongruent trials. The neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying these associations are further discussed, and the Eyes Test features that may require top-down visual attention will be explored in depth.",

    "abstract": "Immunoassays are commonly used methods for detection of small molecules that typically require numerous steps of the labeling between immune-recognition reagents and tracers, immobilization and recurrent washing, making them time consuming and difficult to adapt into point of care formats. Here we describe a \"ready-to-use\" homogeneous competitive immunosensor with an assay time of 10 min that is based exclusively on recombinant reagents. The signal is produced when the split fragments of the nano luciferase (Nluc) are brought together by the interaction of a heavy chain only variable domain (VHH) with a peptidomimetic of the target small molecule. A VHH to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was used to isolated the peptidomimetic (NGFFEPWQVVYV) from phage display libraries using six panning conditions. Then the peptidomimetic and VHH were fused with the larger (LgN) and smaller piece (SmN) of split fragments of Nluc, respectively. In order to optimize the signal and sensitivity of the immunosensor, we explored the effects of the spacer between the peptidomimetic and LgN, the copy number of peptidomimetics, and the spacer between SmN and VHH, generating 24 combinations that allowed to conclude on their respective roles. Eventually, the developed \"ready-to-use\" immunosensor performed excellent signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity, and could be applied to the detection of 2,4-D in real samples. Meanwhile, the immunosensor totally realizes labeling-free, immobilization-free and washing-free, also can be produced in a highly cost effective way.",

Many patients seeking healthcare post-sexual assault either do not initiate HIV PEP or do not complete the 28-day medication regimen. In this qualitative interpretive description, we interviewed sexual assault patients (N=11) about HIV PEP discussions/reactions, attitudes and understanding related to HIV and PEP, and barriers and facilitators of HIV PEP acceptance and adherence. Participants described a process of losing and reclaiming control throughout post-assault care and follow-up; and how this affected HIV PEP-related decision-making.

In order to take advantage of this event, we produced seven gravitational lens models with five independent methods, based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Hubble Frontier Field images, along with extensive spectroscopic follow-up observations by HST, the Very Large and the Keck Telescopes. We compare the model predictions and show that they agree reasonably well with the measured time delays and magnification ratios between the known images, even though these quantities were not used as input. This agreement is encouraging, considering that the models only provide statistical uncertainties, and do not include additional sources of uncertainties such as structure along the line of sight, cosmology, and the mass sheet degeneracy. We then present the model predictions for the other appearances of supernova \"Refsdal.\" A future image will reach its peak in the first half of 2016, while another image appeared between 1994 and 2004. The past image would have been too faint to be detected in existing archival images. The future image should be approximately one-third as bright as the brightest known image (i.e., mag at peak and mag six months before peak), and thus detectable in single-orbit HST images. We will find out soon whether our predictions are correct.",

    "abstract": "Hormone receptor status is an integral component of decision-making in breast cancer management. IHC4 score is an algorithm that combines hormone receptor, HER2, and Ki-67 status to provide a semiquantitative prognostic score for breast cancer. High accuracy and low interobserver variance are important to ensure the score is accurately calculated; however, few previous efforts have been made to measure or decrease interobserver variance. We developed a Web-based training tool, called \"Score the Core\" (STC) using tissue microarrays to train pathologists to visually score estrogen receptor (using the 300-point H score), progesterone receptor (percent positive), and Ki-67 (percent positive). STC used a reference score calculated from a reproducible manual counting method. Pathologists in the Athena Breast Health Network and pathology residents at associated institutions completed the exercise. By using STC, pathologists improved their estrogen receptor H score and progesterone receptor and Ki-67 proportion assessment and demonstrated a good correlation between pathologist and reference scores. In addition, we collected information about pathologist performance that allowed us to compare individual pathologists and measures of agreement. Pathologists' assessment of the proportion of positive cells was closer to the reference than their assessment of the relative intensity of positive cells. Careful training and assessment should be used to ensure the accuracy of breast biomarkers. This is particularly important as breast cancer diagnostics become increasingly quantitative and reproducible. Our training tool is a novel approach for pathologist training that can serve as an important component of ongoing quality assessment and can improve the accuracy of breast cancer prognostic biomarkers.",

However, power asymmetries between these actors can privilege the perspectives of dominant groups, while preventing non-dominant perspectives from informing conservation science. Methods: This study investigates a workshop series intended to support young people in designing a watershed monitoring initiative rooted in their own interests with respect to a large dam removal in their community. We use interaction analysis to examine whose ideas are taken up in discussions among young people, educators, conservation professionals, and education researchers. Findings: Power dynamics that privilege the contributions of credentialed professionals over those of young people can constrain collective learning processes while simultaneously generating tensions that allow for expansive learning to occur. Facilitation practices and other pedagogical moves play an important role in either further entrenching or disrupting hierarchies between youth and community partners. Contribution: Our analysis reveals how careful attention to interactional dynamics—both as a research method and as a pedagogical practice—can make visible and disrupt epistemic hierarchies in multi-stakeholder learning environments. Problematizing these hierarchies can help broaden the perspectives from which knowledge is generated, a necessary endeavor in building resilient social-ecological systems.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the role that physical design plays in shaping women’s everyday experiences in public space by studying gender differences in the use of a 1.3-acre urban park in a specific cultural enclave. Through direct observation, behavior mapping, and quantitative analysis, the project reveals an obvious gender separation of space usage in Portsmouth Square in the Chinatown district of San Francisco, California. In-depth interviews exposed a range of reasons for this separation and revealed how some Chinese immigrants construct and negotiate their social dynamics and territoriality on the urban square. The findings reaffirm that men and women often have different preferences in open spaces as well as different concepts of optimum public space experiences. Results also indicate that observed segregation by gender is not all voluntary. In this case, besides the known factors such as cultural and social norms, physical space design is important in shaping women’s use of public space, perpetuating and even intensifying gender separation and inequity. This study addresses and highlights some spatial elements that can be easily overlooked by landscape architects and environmental planners. It argues that to create a gender-inclusive-or, at a minimum, genderaware- public space, designers must consider not only the differences of ability, movement, and designated spots but also barriers, interruptions, and spaces avoided or inaccessible by specific populations.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Agency in contraceptive decision-making is an essential aspect of reproductive autonomy. We conducted qualitative research to investigate what agency means to patients seeking contraceptive care to inform the development of a validated measure of this construct. METHODOLOGY: We held four focus group discussions and seven interviews with sexually-active individuals assigned female at birth, ages 16-29 years, recruited from reproductive health clinics in Northern California. We explored experiences in contraceptive decision-making during the clinic visit. We coded data in ATLAS.ti and by hand, compared codes across three coders, and used thematic analysis to identify salient themes. RESULTS: The sample mean age was 21 years, with 17% of participants identifying as Asian, 23% as Black, 27% as Latinx, 17% as Multiracial/other, and 27% as white. Overall, participants reported active and engaged decision-making in their recent contraceptive visit but noted experiences that had undermined their agency in the past. They described how non-judgmental care allowed them to communicate openly, affirming their ability to make their own decisions. However, several mentioned how unexpected contraceptive side effects after the visit had reduced their sense of agency over their decision in retrospect. Several participants, including those who identified as Black, Latinx, and/or Asian, described prior experiences where pressure to use a contraceptive method had undermined their agency and where they had switched providers to regain agency over their contraceptive decisions. DISCUSSION: Most participants were aware of their agency during contraceptive visits and how it varied in different experiences with providers and the healthcare system. Patient perspectives can help to inform measurement development and ultimately the delivery of care that supports contraceptive agency.",

Only if the tension between commitment to the rule of law and commitment to one's ethnic or religious affiliation was, so to speak, in the news would a television writer put it at the heart of a story.” During the same week that Fish published this claim, a Texas woman who drowned her five children had her guilty verdict overturned when it was revealed that an expert witness for the prosecution had made false statements to the court about an episode of the very same show. Commentators on the case said the witness had confused plots from<jats:italic>Law and Order</jats:italic>with real-life trials. One need not be Oscar Wilde to see a meta-dramatic chiasmus at work here:<jats:italic>Law and Order</jats:italic>imitates life, but life also imitates<jats:italic>Law and Order</jats:italic>. The same could be said of popular Victorian crime fiction, which was serialized in eagerly awaited autonomous episodes in a manner not unlike televised crime drama. Victorian authors, moreover, commonly sought inspiration in real-life criminal plots.

In this article, I will examine a previously unexplored instance of such fictional recycling and reinvention: L. T.

    "abstract": "Recently, an analytic method was developed to study in the large N limit non-Hermitian random matrices that are drawn from a large class of circularly symmetric non-Gaussian probability distributions, thus extending the existing Gaussian non-Hermitian literature. One obtains an explicit algebraic equation for the integrated density of eigenvalues from which the Green's function and averaged density of eigenvalues could be calculated in a simple manner. Thus, that formalism may be thought of as the non-Hermitian analog of the method due to Brézin, Itzykson, Parisi, and Zuber for analyzing Hermitian non-Gaussian random matrices. A somewhat surprising result is the so called \"single ring\" theorem, namely, that the domain of the eigenvalue distribution in the complex plane is either a disk or an annulus. In this article we extend previous results and provide simple new explicit expressions for the radii of the eigenvalue distribution and for the value of the eigenvalue density at the edges of the eigenvalue distribution of the non-Hermitian matrix in terms of moments of the eigenvalue distribution of the associated Hermitian matrix. We then present several numerical verifications of the previously obtained analytic results for the quartic ensemble and its phase transition from a disk shaped eigenvalue distribution to an annular distribution. Finally, we demonstrate numerically the \"single ring\" theorem for the sextic potential, namely, the potential of lowest degree for which the \"single ring\" theorem has nontrivial consequences. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.",

The much discussed \"site binding\" of calcium ions to these industrially relevant polymers is driven by an entropy gain as water molecules are released into the solution. At high NaPA concentrations, increased Ca2+-PA monomer ratios will not result in strong coiling of PA oligomers. This is due to the local rigidity induced by the binding of many Ca2+ ions to the polymer. Because the uncoiled state of the crowded chain obstructs formation of high Ca2+-COO- coordination numbers, interchain interactions will become favorable, and formation of PA aggregates can be expected. On the other hand, at low NaPA concentrations, introduction of Ca 2+ ions to the solution leads to the formation of very stable coiled configurations, with local crystal-like structures, in which the Ca2+ ions cluster together. It is the sharing of carboxylate groups among the metal ions that leads to the formation of these crystal-like conformations, inducing desolvation and precipitation of the chain at threshold Ca2+ concentrations. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",

The nanosize requirements are intrinsic for NPs to exhibit quantum or SET behaviors, for example, 10 nm or smaller, at room temperature. This work represents the first observation of SET that defies the well-known size restriction. Using polycrystalline Au NPs synthesized via our newly developed solid-state glycine matrices method, a Coulomb Blockade was observed for particles as large as tens of nanometers, and the blockade voltage exhibited little dependence on the size of the NPs. These observations are counterintuitive at first glance. Further investigations reveal that each observed SET arises from the ultrasmall single crystalline grain(s) within the polycrystal NP, which is (are) sufficiently isolated from the nearest neighbor grains. This work demonstrates the concept and feasibility to overcome orthodox spatial confinement requirements to achieve quantum effects.",

Previous studies indicated its role in cholesterol/steroid (estramustine, estradiol, and progesterone) trafficking/sequestration, oxidative stress response, and Alzheimer's disease. Developmental studies have shown its expression during macrophage and oligodendrocyte differentiation, processes requiring membrane growth. To determine the in vivo function(s) of this transporter, we generated a knockout mouse from a gene-targeted disruption of the murine ABCA2 gene. Knockout males and females are viable and fertile. However, a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern was shown among male progeny of heterozygous crosses. Compared to wild-type and heterozygous littermates, knockout mice displayed a tremor without ataxia, hyperactivity, and reduced body weight; the latter two phenotypes were more marked in females than in males. This sexual disparity suggests a role for ABCA2 in hormone-dependent neurological and/or developmental pathways. Myelin sheath thickness in the spinal cords of knockout mice was greatly increased compared to that in wild-type mice, while a significant reduction in myelin membrane periodicity (compaction) was observed in both spinal cords and cerebra of knockout mice. Loss of ABCA2 function in vivo resulted in abnormal myelin compaction in spinal cord and cerebrum, an ultrastructural defect that we propose to be the cause of the phenotypic tremor.",

SAMPLE AND MEASUREMENTS: I interviewed 28 nurse educators teaching theory courses in Baccalaureate nursing programs on the West coast of the United States. Initial and focused codes were constructed from interview transcripts to understand and contextualize statements about social justice. RESULTS: Participants' conceptualizations of social justice include equity, equality, self-awareness, withholding judgment, and taking action. CONCLUSIONS: Notable differences emerged along racial lines and, less so, in relation to educational background and nursing specialty. This study highlights areas of concern with respect to how nurse educators enact the claim that social justice is a core professional nursing value. The findings call attention to tensions and contradictions as individuals navigate the landscape of nursing with limited structural and institutional effort.",

Societalization refers to the process through which institutional failures are transformed into societal crises, with the civil sphere mobilized to discuss institutional dysfunctions, push for reforms, and attempt to democratize or otherwise transform institutional cultures. The societalization of pandemic unpreparedness in Taiwan led to reforms of the public health administration and the medical profession, thereby establishing state mechanisms for encouraging early responses and coordinating centralized command during outbreaks, and healthcare infrastructures for coordinating patient transfer and ensuring supplies of personal protective equipment. Reflections upon past uncivil acts among citizens motivated the civil sphere to foster a discourse of interdependence, redefining the boundaries between individual choices and civic virtues. Meanwhile, unaddressed challenges remained, including threats related to Taiwan's political polarization. Our paper challenges the thesis of \"authoritarian advantage,\" highlighting how democratic societies can foster social preparedness to respond to crises.

    "abstract": "To address the current obesity and inactivity epidemics, public health researchers have attempted to identify spatial factors that influence physical inactivity and obesity. Technologic and methodologic developments have led to a revolutionary ability to examine dynamic, high-resolution measures of temporally matched location and behavior data through GPS, accelerometry, and GIS. These advances allow the investigation of spatial energetics, high-spatiotemporal resolution data on location and time-matched energetics, to examine how environmental characteristics, space, and time are linked to activity-related health behaviors with far more robust and detailed data than in previous work. Although the transdisciplinary field of spatial energetics demonstrates promise to provide novel insights on how individuals and populations interact with their environment, there remain significant conceptual, technical, analytical, and ethical challenges stemming from the complex data streams that spatial energetics research generates. First, it is essential to better understand what spatial energetics data represent, the relevant spatial context of analysis for these data, and if spatial energetics can establish causality for development of spatially relevant interventions. Second, there are significant technical problems for analysis of voluminous and complex data that may require development of spatially aware scalable computational infrastructures. Third, the field must come to agreement on appropriate statistical methodologies to account for multiple observations per person.

    "abstract": "Despite institutional claims that social justice is a core professional nursing value, efforts to fulfill this claim remain uneven. The purpose of this study was to examine the circumstances that shape nursing educators' approaches to social justice. In-depth semi-structured interviews with 28 educators teaching theory courses in baccalaureate nursing programs shed light upon the influences that shape how educators integrate social justice. These include formative experiences, institutional factors, and curricular opportunities. Formative experiences include upbringing, educational background, and preparation to teach. Institutional factors consist of the type of institution, geographic location, and the specter of retention, promotion, and tenure. Finally, curricular opportunities and fit include the positioning of Community Health Nursing, fragmentation and tension between \"content and context,\" and the \"driving force\" of the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX). Findings indicate that the capacity to uphold the value of social justice is shaped by experiences across the lifespan, institutional policies, and practices related to faculty hiring, development, career advancement, as well as curricular vision. This study calls for a concerted effort to enact social justice nursing education.",

In addition, political talk conditioned experimental effects on perceptions of news credibility, with the adverse effects of split screen presentations concentrated among those who talked about the debate. Thus, the negative effects of in your face politics conveyed by the split-screen modality appear to be most pronounced among those primed to think about performance and those attuned to politics through interpersonal talk.",

The development of cellular regenerative therapies has the potential to improve outcomes of nerve injuries. However, an ideal therapy has yet to be found. The purpose of this study is to examine the current literature key points of regenerative techniques using human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) for nerve regeneration and derive a comprehensive approach to hADSC therapy for PNI. METHODS: A literature review was conducted using the electronic database PubMed to search for current experimental approaches to repairing PNI using hADSCs. Key search elements focused on specific components of nerve regeneration paradigms, including (1) support cells, (2) scaffolds, and (3) nerve conduits. RESULTS: Strategic sequences were developed by optimizing the components of different experimental regenerative therapies. These sequences focus on priming hADSCs within a specialized growth medium, a hydrogel matrix base, and a collagen nerve conduit to achieve neuromodulatory nerve regeneration. hADSCs may exert their neuroregenerative influence through paracrine effects on surrounding Schwann cells in addition to physical interactions with injured tissue. CONCLUSIONS: hADSCs may play a key role in nerve regeneration by acting primarily as support for local neurotrophic mediation and modulation of nerve growth rather than that of a primary neuronal differentiation agent.",

    "abstract": "The so-called \"strength of weak ties\" is a central concept in social network theory, especially for understanding how information and diseases are transmitted through socially structured populations. In general, weak ties occur in networks where relatively few individuals are responsible for maintaining linkages between groups of individuals that would otherwise be poorly connected. This common structural motif can be seen in the social networks of species with fission-fusion social organization, such as giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis). Giraffe social networks are characterized by social cliques in which individuals associate more with members of their own social clique than with those outside their clique. Individuals involved in weak, between-clique social interactions are hypothesized to serve as bridges by which an infection may enter a clique and, hence, may experience higher infection risk. Here, we address this and other hypotheses explaining helminth infection patterns in wild giraffe, exploring the relative roles of the social network and ranging behavior in determining infection risk. We show that infection risk is more influenced by weak ties with individuals outside one's clique than by repeated contact with a core set of associates. Even when controlling for age and home range size, individuals who engaged in more between-clique associations, that is, those with multiple weak ties, were more likely to be infected with gastrointestinal helminth parasites. Our results suggest that diverse social interactions with giraffe from multiple cliques may increase exposure to pathogens. The importance of weak ties in pathogen transmission has only rarely been empirically demonstrated in wildlife.",

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, farmers and researchers have firmly established that biologically diversified farming systems improve ecosystem services both on and off the farm, producing economic benefits for farmers and ecological benefits for surrounding landscapes. However, adoption of these practices has been slow, requiring a more nuanced examination of both barriers and opportunities to improve adoption rates. While previous research has demonstrated that both individual and structural factors shape farmers' decisions about whether to adopt diversification practices, this study aims to understand the interaction of these individual and structural factors, and how they relate to farm scale. Based on 20 interviews with organic lettuce growers on the Central Coast of California, as well as 8 interviews with technical assistance providers who work with these growers, we constructed a typology to help elucidate the distinct contexts that shape growers' decisions about diversification practices. This typology, which reflects the structural influence of land rent and supply chains, divides growers into three categories: limited resource, mid-scale diversified, or wholesale. In this economic context, limited resource and wholesale growers both experience significant barriers that constrain the adoption of diversification practices, while some mid-scale diversified growers have found a “sweet spot” for managing agroecosystems that can succeed in both economic and ecological terms. The key enabling factors that allow these farmers to choose diversification, however, are not directly related to their farm size, but have more to do with secure land tenure, adequate access to capital and resources, and buyers who share their values and are willing to pay a premium. By focusing on these key enabling factors with targeted policies, we believe it is possible to encourage diversification practices on farms at a variety of scales within California's Central Coast.",

Although current literature suggests framing conversations regarding end of life through the lens of meaning and quality of life, there is limited literature exploring dyadic congruence surrounding these important constructs among patients with ventricular assist devices (VADs) and their caregivers. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore congruence of VAD patient and caregiver perspectives regarding end of life, definitions of quality of life, and meaning in life while managing the uncertainty of living with a VAD. METHODS: We used thematic analysis to analyze semistructured qualitative interviews of 10 patient-caregiver dyads 3 to 12 months after VAD implantation. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: (1) differing trajectories of uncertainty and worry, (2) a spectrum of end-of-life perspectives, and (3) enjoying everyday moments and independence. Overall, patients and caregivers had differing perspectives regarding uncertainty and end of life. Within-dyad congruence was most evident as dyads discussed definitions of meaning or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Dyadic perspectives on end of life, meaning in life, and quality of life can inform how palliative care and VAD teams approach conversations about planning for the end of life. Findings from this study can inform future shared decision-making interventions for patients living with VADs and their caregivers.",

After decades of research and development, both the passive targeting ability of the inherent properties of NPs and the active targeting based on ligand receptor interaction have gained deeper understanding. Unfortunately, most targeted delivery strategies are still in the preclinical trial stage, so it is necessary to further study the biological fate of particles in vivo and the interaction mechanism with tumors. This article reviews different targeted delivery strategies based on NPs, and focuses on the physical and chemical properties of NPs (size, morphology, surface and intrinsic properties), ligands (binding number/force, activity and species) and receptors (endocytosis, distribution and recycling) and other factors that affect particle targeting. The limitations and solutions of these factors are further discussed, and a variety of new targeting schemes are introduced, hoping to provide guidance for future targeting design and achieve the purpose of rapid transformation of targeted particles into clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Most medical faculty receive little or no training about how to be effective teachers, even when they assume major educational leadership roles. To identify the competencies required of an effective teacher in medical education, the authors developed a comprehensive conceptual model. After conducting a literature search, the authors met at a two-day conference (2006) with 16 medical and nonmedical educators from 10 different U.S. and Canadian organizations and developed an initial draft of the \"Teaching as a Competency\" conceptual model. Conference participants used the physician competencies (from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME]) and the roles (from the Royal College's Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists [CanMEDS]) to define critical skills for medical educators. The authors then refined this initial framework through national/regional conference presentations (2007, 2008), an additional literature review, and expert input. Four core values grounded this framework: learner engagement, learner-centeredness, adaptability, and self-reflection. The authors identified six core competencies, based on the ACGME competencies framework: medical (or content) knowledge; learner- centeredness; interpersonal and communication skills; professionalism and role modeling; practice-based reflection; and systems-based practice. They also included four specialized competencies for educators with additional programmatic roles: program design/implementation, evaluation/scholarship, leadership, and mentorship. The authors then cross-referenced the competencies with educator roles, drawing from CanMEDS, to recognize role-specific skills. The authors have explored their framework's strengths, limitations, and applications, which include targeted faculty development, evaluation, and resource allocation. The Teaching as a Competency framework promotes a culture of effective teaching and learning.",

The children's reports fell into the following categories based on a 2 (event type: true vs. false) × 2 (child report: assent vs. denial) factorial design: accurate reports, false reports, accurate denials, and false denials. Results revealed that adults were generally better able to correctly judge accurate reports, accurate denials, and false reports compared with false denials: For false denials, adults were, on average, \"confident\" that the event had not occurred, even though the event had in fact been experienced. Participant age predicted performance. These findings underscore the greater difficulty adults have in evaluating young children's false denials compared with other types of reports.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common, often challenging to manage, and may erode caregivers' well-being. Few studies have explored caregivers' perspectives of what causes these behaviors, but such attributions may be important-particularly if they negatively impact the care dyad. This study examined causal attributions about BPSD among individuals caring for a family member with dementia. DESIGN: In-depth qualitative data were obtained from family caregivers of older adults with dementia. SETTING: As part of a larger study (NINR R01NR014200), four focus groups were conducted with caregivers by an experienced facilitator. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 26 family caregivers participated in the four focus groups. MEASUREMENTS: Caregivers reported their own attributions about the causes of their care recipient's BPSD. Sessions were audio-recorded. Data were transcribed, coded to determine relevant concepts, and reduced to identify major categories. RESULTS: Five categories were determined. Caregivers attributed BPSD to: 1) neurobiological disease factors; 2) physical symptoms or comorbid health conditions; 3) psychological reactions to dementia; 4) shifting social roles and relationships following dementia onset; and 5) environmental changes such as lack of routine and medical transitions (e.g., hospitalization). Despite this seemingly multifactorial attribution to BPSD etiology, a number of respondents also indicated that BPSD were at least partly within the care recipient's control. CONCLUSIONS: Family caregivers attribute BPSD to a range of care recipient and environmental factors. Caregivers' own causal beliefs about BPSD may reflect unmet educational needs that should be considered in the development of targeted interventions to minimize caregiving stress.",

Oceanic infrastructure was a new feature of the British Empire especially in the period after 1860, when steamships were increasingly replacing sailing ships and when the material exigencies of fueling and refueling required the installation of coaling stations to support long-haul transport for steam-powered ships. In this essay we explore how these changes registered in literature and discourse, with Joseph Conrad as our prime example. We analyze two of Conrad's works that feature coaling stations and steam-carrying, <jats:italic>Victory</jats:italic> (1915) and <jats:italic>The Mirror of the Sea</jats:italic> (1906). Drawing on infrastructure studies, critical ocean studies, and the energy humanities, we make a case for more attention to oceangoing coal as part of a broader reconsideration of empire in the Anthropocene. We also make a case for Conrad as one of the great observers of environmental-infrastructural change in the early fossil-fuel era, worth revisiting now as both witness and interpreter.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Historically, hemorrhage has been attributed as the leading cause (40%) of early death. However, a rigorous, real-time classification of the cause of death (COD) has not been performed. This study sought to prospectively adjudicate and classify COD to determine the epidemiology of trauma mortality. METHODS: Eighteen trauma centers prospectively enrolled all adult trauma patients at the time of death during December 2015 to August 2017. Immediately following death, attending providers adjudicated the primary and contributing secondary COD using standardized definitions. Data were confirmed by autopsies, if performed. RESULTS: One thousand five hundred thirty-six patients were enrolled with a median age of 55 years (interquartile range, 32-75 years), 74.5% were male. Penetrating mechanism (n = 412) patients were younger (32 vs. 64, p < 0.0001) and more likely to be male (86.7% vs. 69.9%, p < 0.0001). Falls were the most common mechanism of injury (26.6%), with gunshot wounds second (24.3%). The most common overall primary COD was traumatic brain injury (TBI) (45%), followed by exsanguination (23%). Traumatic brain injury was nonsurvivable in 82.2% of cases. Blunt patients were more likely to have TBI (47.8% vs. 37.4%, p < 0.0001) and penetrating patients exsanguination (51.7% vs. 12.5%, p < 0.0001) as the primary COD. Exsanguination was the predominant prehospital (44.7%) and early COD (39.1%) with TBI as the most common later. Penetrating mechanism patients died earlier with 80.1% on day 0 (vs. 38.5%, p < 0.0001). Most deaths were deemed disease-related (69.3%), rather than by limitation of further aggressive care (30.7%). Hemorrhage was a contributing cause to 38.8% of deaths that occurred due to withdrawal of care. CONCLUSION: Exsanguination remains the predominant early primary COD with TBI accounting for most deaths at later time points. Timing and primary COD vary significantly by mechanism. Contemporaneous adjudication of COD is essential to elucidate the true understanding of patient outcome, center performance, and future research. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Epidemiologic, level II.",

METHODS: Parents of sons with XLRS who were evaluated at the National Eye Institute between December 2017 and January 2019 were eligible for this study. Participation involved engaging in a semistructured interview and completing a survey assessing optimism, anxiety, personality traits, and sociodemographics using valid and reliable scales. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically, and scales were scored and used descriptively. RESULTS: Eleven mothers and 8 fathers from 13 families participated. Optimism, anxiety, and personality traits fell into the normative ranges for the scales. Parents described a process of continuous adaptation to their son's condition. The initial diagnosis was characterized by shock, grief, and \"devastation\" for most parents. Maternal guilt was common, but usually lessened over time. As parents adjusted to life postdiagnosis, they attempted to achieve a state of normalcy while balancing a desire to protect their sons. Significant sources of stress included decisions around sports participation and driving. Among all parents, the fear of retinal detachment was an ongoing concern. Most parents did identify perceived benefits from their experiences, such as feelings of gratitude or family cohesion. CONCLUSIONS: Most parents viewed XLRS as a significant challenge in their sons' lives, but one that could be overcome. Clinical encounters may be enhanced for families with XLRS by providing accurate information, preparing families for potential challenges, anticipating stressful decisions, and meeting other families with XLRS.",

Little is known about organizational and primary care team factors that influence the uptake of the HPV vaccine. Interviews with clinicians, clinic support staff, and parents of adolescent patients were conducted to better understand the interrelationships among the people and the organizational processes that influence HPV vaccine uptake at the point of care. Between July 2016 and February 2017, semi-structured interviews of 40 participants (18 clinicians, 12 clinic support staff, and 10 parents of adolescent patients) in a primary care network were conducted. Organizational structures and processes, such as electronic provider reminders, availability of \"vaccination only\" appointments, and knowledgeable primary care team members contributed to HPV vaccine uptake. Consistently high support of HPV vaccination was found among key informants; however, rather than refuse HPV vaccination, parents are opting to delay vaccination to a future visit. When parents express the desire to delay, clinicians and care team members described often recommending addressing HPV vaccination at a future visit, giving parents the impression that receiving the vaccine was not time-sensitive for their child. Discordance in HPV vaccination recommendations among providers and clinic support staff may contribute to delayed HPV vaccination. Strong, high-quality HPV vaccine recommendations are needed from all primary team members. Clinic interventions to accelerate HPV vaccine uptake may benefit from a team-based approach where every member of the primary care team is delivering the same consistent messaging about the importance of timely HPV vaccination.",

This study seeks to understand how family physicians themselves perceive the relationship between their specialty's values and abortion provision. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews in 2019 with 56 family physicians who do not oppose abortion in the United States. We employed a deductive-inductive content analysis approach with memos to identify key themes. This analysis focuses on participants' beliefs in the core values of family medicine and how those values relate to abortion in family medicine. RESULTS: Participants identified and described six values of the specialty they prioritized, which included relationships, care across the lifespan, whole-person care, nonjudgmental care, meeting community needs, and social justice. Family physicians in the study overwhelmingly believed that abortion aligned with family medicine values, regardless of whether they themselves provided abortion care. CONCLUSIONS: Providing abortion care in primary care settings gives family physicians an opportunity to provide comprehensive care while improving access to meet community needs. As abortion care becomes increasingly restricted in the United States, family physicians can manifest the values of family medicine through integrating abortion care into their practices in states where abortion remains legal.",

    "abstract": "Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the “Ostrom Workshop.” A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a “constitutional layer” of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.",

Although some say that fitspiration inspires women towards an empowered body image, others argue that fitspirational social media use may negatively influence women's body image. To address these concerns, the current study (359 women; ages 18–28 years) investigated how exposure to four types of fitspirational social media messages related to three indicators of body image: body dissatisfaction, compulsive exercise, and situated optimism related to body goals. Moreover, we investigated the role of two individual difference variables in predicting women's exposure to fitspirational messages and moderating the relationships between exposure and indicators of body image: thin-ideal internalization and fit-ideal internalization. Overall, the study provides support for both positive and negative correlates of fitspirational social media use. In addition, the findings provide initial evidence that individual difference variables differentially predict exposure to certain types of fitspirational content and moderate the relationship between fitspirational social media and body image related variables. Thus, this study emphasizes that the relationship between fitspirational social media and body image involves a complex interaction between characteristics of consumers and the exact content that is being consumed.",

While the motivation for employing VR-style websites is to attract people to consume the experience in real life, we proposed and found that VR-style (vs. traditional) websites may dissuade them from future consumption (Study 1). We argued that perceived similarity between virtual and real experiences mediates this negative effect. Study 2 suggested that because people's enduring involvement with a product determines their ability to discriminate well between episodes of product experience, it causes variation in both perceived similarity and consumption intention, with the former mediating the latter. Study 3 showed that this negative effect reversed in experiences in which perceived similarity was low. Study 4 demonstrated that this negative effect disappeared when perceived similarity is irrelevant to the consumption decision, for example, when the decision is whether or not to recommend the experience to a friend.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The US Military has achieved the highest casualty survival rates in its history. However, there remain multiple areas in combat trauma that present challenges to the delivery of high-quality and effective trauma care. Previous work has identified research priorities for pre-hospital care, but there has been no similar analysis for forward surgical care. METHODS: A list of critical \"focus areas\" was developed by the Committee on Surgical Combat Casualty Care (CoSCCC). Individual topics were solicited and mapped to appropriate focus areas by group consensus and review of Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) and Joint Trauma System guidelines. A web-based survey was distributed to the CoSCCC and the military committees of EAST and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Topics were rated on a Likert scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high priority). Descriptives, univariate statistics, and inter-rater correlation analysis was performed. RESULTS: 13 research focus areas were identified (eight clinical and five adjunctive categories). Ninety individual topics were solicited. The survey received 64 responses. The majority of respondents were military (90%) versus civilians (10%). There was moderate to high agreement (inter-rater correlation coefficient = 0.93, p < 0.01) for 10 focus areas. The top five focus areas were Personnel/Staffing (mean, 8.03), Resuscitation and Hemorrhage Management (7.49), Pain/Sedation/Anxiety Management (6.96), Operative Interventions (6.9), and Initial Evaluation (6.9). The \"Top 10\" research priorities included four in Personnel/Staffing, four in Resuscitation/Hemorrhage Management, and three in Operative Interventions. A complete list of the topics/scores will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first objective ranking of research priorities for combat trauma care. The \"Top 10\" priorities were all from three focus areas, supporting prioritization of personnel/staffing of austere teams, resuscitation/hemorrhage control, and damage-control interventions. This data will help guide Department of Defense research programs and new areas for prioritized funding of both military and civilian researchers. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Study design, level IV.",

Theeuwes (2018) has argued that that top-down control is much less common than typically assumed and that a third mechanism-selection history-plays an underappreciated role in guiding visual attention. Although Theeuwes has made a strong case for the importance of selection history, his arguments for a limited role of top-down mechanisms involve conflating the terms \"top-down\" and \"voluntary.\" Cognitive psychologists typically use the term \"top-down\" processing to refer to any perceptual phenomenon that is influenced by context, learning, or expectation, which would include selection history. This highlights a broad problem in attention capture research: The terms used to describe attentional control are often poorly defined, and much current debate seems to be related to the meaning of words. To move forward in understanding the actual mechanisms of attentional control, we must agree on what terms such as \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" actually mean.",

However, a closer look at this body of literature reveals deep empirical inconsistencies and theoretical confusion regarding the extent to which this 'other' stimulus is processed. We argue that many key debates regarding attention arise, at least in part, from inappropriate terminological choices for experimental variables that may not accurately map onto the cognitive constructs they are meant to describe. Here we critically review the more common or disruptive terminological ambiguities, differentiate between methodology-based and theory-derived terms, and unpack the theoretical assumptions underlying different terminological choices. Particularly, we offer an in-depth analysis of the terms 'unattended' and 'distractor' and demonstrate how their use can lead to conflicting theoretical inferences. We also offer a framework for thinking about terminology in a more productive and precise way, in hope of fostering more productive debates and promoting more nuanced and accurate cognitive models of selective attention.",

The sex-specific performance of this instrument was explored on 1088 male and 352 female patients, 18 years or older, admitted with blunt or penetrating trauma during a 30-month period to a regional level one trauma center in Seattle, Washington (USA). The sum of the differentially weighted alcohol markers (\"WAM\"), determined from one blood sample, formed a \"score continuum\" ranging from 0 to 24. The WAM scores distributed themselves across the trauma population with higher WAM scores being correlated to higher screening instrument scores for alcohol problems. By using two of the best established screening tests for alcohol problems (CAGE and SMAST) to define cut-off points for likely \"alcohol abuse/dependence\", the WAM score of > or = 7 in males showed 75% sensitivity and 83% specificity, whereas the WAM score of > or = 6 for females displayed 85% sensitivity and 85% specificity. We conclude that a weighted combination of biological alcohol markers (WAM score) is a useful tool for identifying alcohol problems among trauma patients. Representing an alternative or addition to a more extensive interview, it could be used as a routine part of the care of trauma patients.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many community health centers (CHC) are scaling social risk screening in response to growing awareness of the influence of social adversity on health outcomes and concurrent incentives for social risk data collection. We studied the implementation of social risk screening in Texas CHCs to inform best practices and understand equity implications. METHODS: Convergent mixed methods of 3 data sources. Using interviews and surveys with CHC providers and staff, we explored social risk screening practices to identify barriers and facilitators; we used electronic health record (EHR) data to assess screening reach and disparities in screening. RESULTS: Across 4 urban/suburban Texas CHCs, we conducted 27 interviews (15 providers/12 staff) and collected 97 provider surveys; 2 CHCs provided EHR data on 18,672 patients screened during the study period. Data revealed 2 cross-cutting themes: 1) there was broad support for social risk screening/care integration that was rooted in CHCs' mission and positionalities, and 2) barriers to social risk screening efforts were largely a result of limited time and staffing. Though EHR data showed screens per month and screens/encounters increased peri-pandemic (4.1% of encounters in 8/2019 to 46.1% in 2/2021), there were significant differences in screening rates by patient race/ethnicity and preferred language (P < .001). In surveys, 90.0% of surveyed providers reported incorporating social risk screening into patient conversations; 28.6% were unaware their clinic had an embedded screening tool. CONCLUSIONS: Study CHCs were in the early stages of standardizing social risk screening. Differences in screening reach by patient demographics raise concerns that social screening initiatives, which often serve as a path to resource/service connection, might exacerbate disparities. Overcoming barriers to reach, sustainability, and equity requires supports targeted to program design/development, workforce capacity, and quality improvement.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adequate water intake is associated with improved cognitive and physical performance, prevention of dental caries, and overweight and obesity. However, access to free drinking water in schools remains inadequate. Water First, a school-based intervention promoting water consumption, was shown effective in preventing overweight, yet its costs have not been quantified. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the costs of Water First from the school's perspective over 1 academic year. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized clinical trial assessing the cost of Water First. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Six public schools in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 2018-2019 academic year, with an average of 578 ± 69 students per school and 110 ± 2 fourth-grade students in intervention schools, and 508 ± 190 students per school and 101 ± 5 fourth-grade students in control schools. INTERVENTION: Schools were randomized to receive water dispensers and stations in cafeterias and high-traffic areas and a schoolwide water promotion campaign (school-level intervention). Fourth-grade students and teachers received reusable water bottles, lessons, and materials for school and home (class-level intervention). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Activities, resources, and the value needed to implement the school-level and classroom-level intervention were systematically captured over 1 academic year, including labor, materials, and utilities costs. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The intervention costs per school and per student were estimated by summing the component-specific costs. Results are presented for both school-level and classroom-level interventions in 2023 US dollars. RESULTS: The Water First intervention costs $20 per student for the school-level and $131 per student for the classroom-level intervention over 1 academic year. Accounting for the useful life of the installed water stations and dispensers beyond 1 year, the annualized cost of the school-level intervention was $11 per student. CONCLUSIONS: These cost estimates provide useful insights for schools and stakeholders to plan and implement effective school-based interventions that promote access to drinking water.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While depression is a leading cause of poor health, less than half of older adults receive adequate care. Inequities in both access and outcomes are even more pronounced for socially disadvantaged older adults. The collaborative care model (CCM) has potential to reduce this burden through community-based organizations (CBOs) who serve these populations. However, CCM has been understudied in diverse cultural and resource-constrained contexts. We evaluated the implementation and effectiveness of PEARLS, a home-based CCM adapted with and for community health workers/promotores (CHWs/Ps). METHODS: We used an instrumental case study design. Our case definition is a community-academic partnership to build CHW/P capacity for evidence-based depression care for older U.S. Latino adults in the Inland Empire region of California (2017-2020). We aimed to understand adaptations to fit local context; acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity; clinical effectiveness; and contextual determinants of implementation success or failure. Data sources included quantitative and qualitative administrative and evaluation data from participants and providers. We used descriptive statistics and paired t-tests to characterize care delivery and evaluate effectiveness post-intervention, and deductive thematic analysis to answer other aims. FINDINGS: This case study included 152 PEARLS participants and nine data sources (N = 67 documents). The CBO including their CHWs/Ps partnered with the external implementation team made adaptations to PEARLS content, context, and implementation strategies to support CHWs/Ps and older adults. PEARLS was acceptable, feasible and delivered with fidelity. Participants showed significant reductions in depression severity at 5 months (98% clinical response rate [mean (SD), 13.7 (3.9) drop in pre/post PHQ-9; p < 0.001] and received support for 2.6 social needs on average. PEARLS delivery was facilitated by its relative advantage, adaptability, and trialability; the team's collective efficacy, buy-in, alignment with organization mission, and ongoing reflection and evaluation during implementation. Delivery was challenged by weak partnerships with clinics for participant referral, engagement, reimbursement, and sustainability post-grant funding. DISCUSSION: This case study used existing data to learn how home-based CCM was adapted by and for CHWs/Ps to reduce health inequities in late-life depression and depression care among older Latino immigrants. The CBOs and CHWs/Ps strong trust and rapport, addressing social and health needs alongside depression care, and regular internal and external coaching and consultation, appeared to drive successful implementation and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Though research has established that firearms in the home increase risk for injury and death, a substantial number of Americans, especially gun owners, believe that guns make their homes safer. More than half of gun owners in a nationally-representative survey said \"it depends\" when asked whether guns make their homes safer or more dangerous, but little is known about the factors that affect perceived safety. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the relationship between the presence of firearms and perceived home or neighborhood safety is fixed or depends on additional factors and to identify the additional factors on which it depends. METHODS: A mixed-methods cross-sectional analysis of the 2018 state-representative California Safety and Wellbeing Survey (n = 2558, completion rate 49%), including calculation of weighted proportions and qualitative analysis of write-in responses. FINDINGS: One in six respondents (17.2%, 95% CI 14.9% to 19.7%) reported \"it depends\" when asked whether a gun in their home made the home a safer or more dangerous place to be (\"the home scenario\"). One in six (16.6%, 95% CI 14.3% to 19.2%) reported \"it depends\" when asked whether the neighborhood would be safer if all neighbors had guns in the home (\"the neighborhood scenario\"). For the home scenario, 28.3% (95% CI 21.9% to 35.7%) cited firearm owner characteristics (e.g., training and proficiency, temperament, and mental health), 28.4% (95% CI 22.3% to 35.5%) cited firearm storage and access, and 28.0% (95% CI 21.5% to 35.7%) cited intended use for guns as factors affecting perceived safety. For the neighborhood scenario, respondents overwhelmingly cited gun owner characteristics (72.1%, 95% CI 63.4% to 79.3%). Factors on which \"it depends\" varied by gun ownership status. CONCLUSION: Perceived safety when firearms are in the home depends on numerous factors. Understanding these factors may inform tailored, targeted messaging and interventions for firearm injury prevention.",

Using the National Health & Aging Trends Study and the National Study of Caregiving, we examine care receiver and caregiver contextual factors, caregiver health and psychological wellbeing as predictors of caregivers' nighttime awakenings. METHODS: The sample for this cross-sectional study included 451 caregivers for individuals with dementia surveyed by telephone. RESULTS: Nighttime awakenings (1 item measure of waking and not being able to return to sleep) almost every night were reported by 16% of caregivers and 10% reported that helping the care receiver caused their sleep to be interrupted most nights. In a multinomial logistic regression, caregivers' greater nighttime awakenings were associated with caring for care recipients with higher fall risk, as well as caregiver characteristics of more chronic medical conditions and emotional difficulty of the care role. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional caregiving difficulties were associated with nighttime awakenings even accounting for caregivers' health and care receivers' disability. Thus, interventions improving caregiver distress may improve sleep health. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians should screen caregivers for nighttime awakenings so that evidence-based interventions and treatments can be implemented to prevent persistent sleep disturbances.",

While past policy efforts have succeeded in reducing particulate matter and trace gases in North America and Europe, adverse health effects are found at even these lower levels of air pollution. Future policy actions will benefit from improved understanding of the interactions and health effects of different chemical species and source categories. Achieving this new understanding requires air pollution scientists and engineers to work increasingly closely with health scientists. In particular, research is needed to better understand the chemical and physical properties of complex air pollutant mixtures, and to use new observations provided by satellites, advanced in situ measurement techniques, and distributed micro monitoring networks, coupled with models, to better characterize air pollution exposure for epidemiological and toxicological research, and to better quantify the effects of specific source sectors and mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Historically, many diseases have been named after the species or location of discovery, the discovering scientists, or the most impacted population. However, species-specific disease names often misrepresent the true reservoir; location-based disease names are frequently targeted with xenophobia; some of the discovering scientists have darker histories; and impacted populations have been stigmatized for this association. Acknowledging these concerns, the World Health Organization now proposes naming diseases after their causative pathogen or symptomatology. Recently, this guidance has been retrospectively applied to a disease at the center of an outbreak rife with stigmatization and misinformation: mpox (f.k.a. 'monkeypox'). This disease, historically endemic to west and central Africa, has prompted racist remarks as it spread globally in 2022 in an epidemic ongoing today. Moreover, its elevated prevalence among men who have sex with men has yielded increased stigma against the LGBTQ+ community. To address these prejudicial associations, 'monkeypox' was renamed 'mpox' in November 2022. We used publicly available data from Google Search Trends to determine which countries were quicker to adopt this name change-and understand factors that limit or facilitate its use. Specifically, we built regression models to quantify the relationship between 'mpox' search intensity in a given country and the country's type of political regime, robustness of sociopolitical and health systems, level of pandemic preparedness, extent of gender and educational inequalities, and temporal evolution of mpox cases through December 2023. Our results suggest that, when compared to 'monkeypox' search intensity, 'mpox' search intensity was significantly higher in countries with any history of mpox outbreaks or higher levels of LGBTQ+ acceptance; meanwhile, 'mpox' search intensity was significantly lower in countries governed by leaders who had recently propagated infectious disease misinformation. Among infectious diseases with stigmatizing names, mpox is among the first to be revised retrospectively. While the adoption of a given disease name will be context-specific-depending in part on its origins and the affected subpopulations-our study provides generalizable insights, applicable to future changes in disease nomenclature.",

Further, relationship partners tend to covary in emotional experience, and in cortisol secretion. However, we are only beginning to understand whether and how an individuals' emotions are linked to their relationship partners' cortisol secretion. In this project, we harmonized data from three intensive measurement studies originating from Canada and Germany to investigate the daily dynamics of emotions and cortisol within 321 older adult couples (age range=56-87 years). Three-level multilevel models accounted for the nested structure of the data (repeated assessments within individuals within couples). Actor-Partner Interdependence Models were used to examine the effect of own emotional experiences (actor effects) and partner emotional experiences (partner effects) on momentary and daily cortisol secretion. Adjusting for age, sex, education, comorbidities, assay version, diurnal cortisol rhythm, time spent together, medication, and time-varying behaviors that may increase cortisol secretion, results suggest that higher relationship partner's positive emotions are linked with lower momentary cortisol and total daily cortisol. Further, this association was stronger for older participants and those who reported higher relationship satisfaction. We did not find within-couple links between negative emotions and cortisol. Overall, our results suggest that one's relationship partner's positive emotional experience may be a protective factor for their physiological responding, and that these more fleeting and day-to-day fluctuations may accumulate over time, contributing to overall relationship satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "The authors investigate how horizontal versus vertical displays of alternatives affect assortment processing, perceived variety, and subsequent choice. Horizontal (vs. vertical) displays are easier to process due to a match between the human binocular vision field (which is horizontal in direction) and the dominant direction of eye movements required for processing horizontal displays. It is demonstrated that this processing fluency allows people to browse information more efficiently, which increases perceived assortment variety and ultimately leads to more variety being chosen, and if the number of options chosen is allowed to vary, it leads to more options chosen. It is shown that because people see more variety in a horizontal (vs. vertical) display, they process a horizontal assortment more extensively. When more variety is positive, they find the choice task easier and have a higher level of satisfaction and confidence about their choices. When more variety is not necessarily positive, for example, in a choice of a single most-preferred option, these effects disappear. Two field studies, an eye-Tracking study, and two lab studies support these conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have demonstrated that, in the absence of postmating barriers to hybridization, reproductive isolation between different forms of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto is maintained by strong assortative mating. The forms of An. gambiae s.s. and the sister species An. arabiensis commonly form mixed swarms in which they mate. This raises the question as to how individuals recognize mates of their own species or form within swarms. It has been proposed that wingbeat frequency is used as a cue to discriminate potential mates. This has important implications for prospective genetic control programs. We used a photosensor to record the transient waveforms generated by individuals An. arabiensis and from the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. as they flew through a beam of light. We found no significant between-species or between-form differences in the fundamental harmonic--equivalent to wingbeat frequency--either in males or females collected from sympatric populations in Mali, West Africa. However, there were significant differences in the amplitude of the first and third harmonics in females and of the first and second harmonics in males. Whereas these results suggest some morphological or behavioral differences between species and forms, the extensive overlap in the distributions of harmonic amplitudes does not point to them as reliable cues for assortative mating. Combining all waveforms parameters into a discriminant analysis did not yield characteristic scores either for males or females. Thus, our results do not support the wingbeat hypothesis of premating isolation in the An. gambiae complex.",

Little is known about the sources of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy among racially/ethnically and geographically diverse communities. The purpose of this paper is to explore HPV vaccine hesitancy among rural, Slavic, and Latino communities that reside in counties with low HPV vaccine uptake rates. METHODS: Key informant interviews and focus groups were conducted with rural, Slavic, and Latino communities that reside within counties in California that have low HPV vaccine up to date rates (16-25%). Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of seven focus groups and 14 key informant interviews were conducted with 39 individuals from seven California counties. Salient themes that contributed to HPV vaccine hesitancy included the following: social media and the anti-vaccination movement; a strong belief in acquiring immunity naturally; prior vaccine experiences; and vaccine timing concerns. Participants suggested the provision of culturally appropriate, in-language, in-person easy to understand HPV vaccine education to mitigate HPV vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings can inform future interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake among hesitant communities.",

The potential associations between Zika and fetal neurological disorders were reported extensively in the media regarding neighboring Brazil, and led to great concern about the impact Zika could have on people's health in Iquitos when it arrived. The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and preventative practices related to Zika virus and its transmission among women of childbearing age in Iquitos, Peru. Six focus group discussions with 46 women of ages 20-35 from an Iquitos district with confirmed Zika cases were conducted to explore: 1) knowledge of Zika transmission, its symptoms, and treatment, 2) attitudes regarding Zika, including perceptions of risk for and severity of Zika, and 3) preventative practices, including awareness of health promotion activities. Participants were knowledgeable about Zika symptoms and knew it was transmitted by mosquitoes, and about half had heard about the association between Zika and microcephaly, but most lacked knowledge about the associated neurological disorders in adults, its sexual transmission, and ways to prevent infection. They expressed concern for pregnant women exposed to the virus and the impact on the fetus. Participants felt at risk of contracting the Zika virus, yet had not changed preventive practices, possibly in part because their perception of the severity of this disease was low. This study reveals knowledge gaps that could be addressed via health promotion messages that might improve prevention practices to help community members protect themselves from Zika virus during this outbreak.",

While popular in social media, their use in educational contexts has been sparsely studied even though emoji can be a natural way for students to express what they are feeling about the learning material. This paper studies how students use instructor-selected emoji when relating to and engaging with educational content. We use an online platform for collaborative annotations where discussions are embedded into the readings for the course. We also make it possible for students to use 11 unique emoji-hashtag pairings to express their thoughts and feelings about the readings and the ongoing discussion. We provide an empirical analysis of the usage of these emoji-hashtag pairs by over 1,800 students enrolled in different offerings of an introductory biology course from multiple academic terms. We also introduce a heat map, which allows the instructional team to visualize the distribution and types of emoji used by students in different parts of the reading material. To evaluate the heat map, we conducted a user study with five instructors/TAs. We found that instructors/TAs use the heat map as a tool for identifying textbook sections that students find difficult and/or interesting and plan to use it to help them design the online content for future classes. Finally, we introduce a computational analysis for predicting emoji/hashtag pairs based on the content of a given student post. We use pre-trained deep learning language models (BERT) to predict the emoji attached to a student’s post and then study the extent to which this model generated in an introductory biology course can be generalized to predict student emoji usage in other courses.",

We introduce and analyze a generalization of these stochastic difference equations with any number of host species, stochastically varying parasitism rates, stochastically varying host intrinsic fitnesses, and stochastic immigration of parasitoids. Despite the lack of direct, host density-dependence, we show that this system is dissipative i.e. enters a compact set in finite time for all initial conditions. When there is a single host species, stochastic persistence and extinction of the host is characterized using external Lyapunov exponents corresponding to the average per-capita growth rates of the host when rare. When a single host persists, say species i, a explicit expression is derived for the average density, P∗ i , of the parasitoid at the stationary distributions supporting both species. When there are multiple host species, we prove that the host species with the largest P∗ i value stochastically persists, while the other host species are asymptotically driven to extinction. A review of the main mathematical methods used to prove the results and future challenges are given.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Both β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) and Gq-coupled receptor (GqR) agonist-driven signaling play key roles in the events, leading up to and during cardiac dysfunction. How these stimuli interact at the level of protein kinase D (PKD), a nodal point in cardiac hypertrophic signaling, remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of PKD activation in response to β-AR signaling alone and on coactivation with GqR-agonists. This will test our hypothesis that compartmentalized PKD signaling reconciles disparate findings of PKA facilitation and inhibition of PKD activation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report on the spatial and temporal profiles of PKD activation using green fluorescent protein-tagged PKD (wildtype or mutant S427E) and targeted fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors (D-kinase activity reporters) in adult cardiomyocytes. We find that β-AR/PKA signaling drives local nuclear activation of PKD, without preceding sarcolemmal translocation. We also discover pronounced interference of β-AR/cAMP/PKA signaling on GqR-induced translocation and activation of PKD throughout the cardiomyocyte. We attribute these effects to direct, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PKD-S427. We also show that phosphomimetic substitution of S427 likewise impedes GqR-induced PKD translocation and activation. In neonatal myocytes, S427E inhibits GqR-evoked cell growth and expression of hypertrophic markers. Finally, we show altered S427 phosphorylation in transverse aortic constriction-induced hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: β-AR signaling triggers local nuclear signaling and inhibits GqR-mediated PKD activation by preventing its intracellular translocation. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PKD-S427 fine-tunes the PKD responsiveness to GqR-agonists, serving as a key integration point for β-adrenergic and Gq-coupled stimuli.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Induction of the fetal hypertrophic marker gene β-myosin heavy chain (β-MyHC) is a signature feature of pressure overload hypertrophy in rodents. β-MyHC is assumed present in all or most enlarged myocytes. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the number and size of myocytes expressing endogenous β-MyHC by a flow cytometry approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocytes were isolated from the left ventricle of male C57BL/6J mice after transverse aortic constriction (TAC), and the fraction of cells expressing endogenous β-MyHC was quantified by flow cytometry on 10,000 to 20,000 myocytes with use of a validated β-MyHC antibody. Side scatter by flow cytometry in the same cells was validated as an index of myocyte size. β-MyHC-positive myocytes constituted 3 ± 1% of myocytes in control hearts (n=12), increasing to 25 ± 10% at 3 days to 6 weeks after TAC (n=24, P<0.01). β-MyHC-positive myocytes did not enlarge with TAC and were smaller at all times than myocytes without β-MyHC (≈70% as large, P<0.001). β-MyHC-positive myocytes arose by addition of β-MyHC to α-MyHC and had more total MyHC after TAC than did the hypertrophied myocytes that had α-MyHC only. Myocytes positive for β-MyHC were found in discrete regions of the left ventricle in 3 patterns: perivascular, in areas with fibrosis, and in apparently normal myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: β-MyHC protein is induced by pressure overload in a minor subpopulation of smaller cardiac myocytes. The hypertrophied myocytes after TAC have α-MyHC only. These data challenge the current paradigm of the fetal hypertrophic gene program and identify a new subpopulation of smaller working ventricular myocytes with more myosin.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that transgenic (TG) expression of either Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) or CaMKIIdeltaB, both of which localize to the nucleus, induces cardiac hypertrophy. However, CaMKIV is not present in heart, and cardiomyocytes express not only the nuclear CaMKIIdeltaB but also a cytoplasmic isoform, CaMKIIdeltaC. In the present study, we demonstrate that expression of the deltaC isoform of CaMKII is selectively increased and its phosphorylation elevated as early as 2 days and continuously for up to 7 days after pressure overload. To determine whether enhanced activity of this cytoplasmic deltaC isoform of CaMKII can lead to phosphorylation of Ca2+ regulatory proteins and induce hypertrophy, we generated TG mice that expressed the deltaC isoform of CaMKII. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated that the expressed transgene is confined to the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes isolated from these mice. These mice develop a dilated cardiomyopathy with up to a 65% decrease in fractional shortening and die prematurely. Isolated myocytes are enlarged and exhibit reduced contractility and altered Ca2+ handling. Phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at a CaMKII site is increased even before development of heart failure, and CaMKII is found associated with the RyR in immunoprecipitates from the CaMKII TG mice. Phosphorylation of phospholamban is also increased specifically at the CaMKII but not at the PKA phosphorylation site. These findings are the first to demonstrate that CaMKIIdeltaC can mediate phosphorylation of Ca2+ regulatory proteins in vivo and provide evidence for the involvement of CaMKIIdeltaC activation in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Integrin heterodimers undergo a conformational change upon the binding of ligand to their extracellular domains. An anti-beta1 integrin monoclonal antibody AG89 can detect such a conformational change since it recognizes a ligand-inducible epitope in the stalk-like region of beta1 subunits. The binding of a 125I-labeled AG89 Fab fragment to alpha5 beta1 integrins on K562 cells was assessed and analyzed by the Scatchard method. High affinity binding sites for AG89 are present on cells treated with ligand peptide. In addition, results revealed that cells treated with EDTA also express AG89 binding sites with the same affinity although the number of binding sites is 4-fold lower. AG89 immunoprecipitated alpha5 beta1 complexes from surface-labeled K562 cells treated with ligand peptide. By contrast, it immunoprecipitated only beta1 chains when the ligand peptide was absent, suggesting that high affinity binding sites on EDTA-treated cells are associated with non-functional beta1 monomer. Additional studies show that the epitope for AG89 is constitutively exposed on mutant beta1 that cannot complex with alpha5. These data suggest that the AG89 epitope is masked by the alpha5 subunit. Ligand binding and integrin activation may uncover the beta1 stalk region by triggering a conformational shift of alpha5 relative to beta1.",

    "abstract": "Trademarks (TMs) shape the competitive landscape of markets for goods and services in all countries. As a key element of branding, they can inform consumers about the quality and content of goods and services. Yet, researchers are largely unable to conduct rigorous empirical analysis of TMs in the global economy because TM data and economic data are organised differently and cannot be analysed jointly at the industry or sector level. We propose an ‘algorithmic links with probabilities’ (ALP) approach to match TM data to economic data and enable joint analysis with these data. Specifically, we construct a NICE class-level concordance that maps TM data into trade and industry categories forward and backward. This concordance allows researchers to analyse differences in TM usage across both economic and TM sectors. We apply this ALP concordance for TMs to characterise patterns in TM registrations across countries and industries and to investigate some key determinants of international technology flows by comparing bilateral TM registrations and bilateral patent grants. We find that international patenting and TM flows are jointly determined by trade-related influences with significant differences in intellectual property usage across industry sectors and income levels.",

Recently, Lybbert and Zolas (2014) have constructed an International Patent Classification (IPC) to industry classification crosswalk using an ‘Algorithmic Links with Probabilities’ approach. In this paper, we utilize a similar approach and apply it to new patent classification schemes, the U.S. Patent Classification (USPC) system and Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) system. The resulting USPC-Industry and CPC-Industry concordances link both U.S. and global patents to multiple vintages of the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), Harmonized System (HS) and Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). We then use the crosswalk to highlight changes to industrial technology composition over time.

The elaborate disc architecture is defined by novel proteins and complexes that decorate almost all disc MT protofilaments, and vary in composition and conformation along the length of the MTs.

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) occurs in carriers of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) X-linked small CGG expansion (gray zone [GZ] and premutation [PM]) alleles, containing 41-200 repeats. Major features comprise kinetic tremor, gait ataxia, cognitive decline and cerebellar peduncular white matter lesions, but atypical/incomplete FXTAS may occur. We explored the possibility of polygenic effects modifying the FXTAS spectrum phenotypes. We used three motor scales and selected cognitive tests in a series of three males and three females from a single sibship carrying PM or GZ alleles (44 to 75 repeats). The molecular profiles from these siblings were determined by genomewide association study with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping by Illumina Global Screening Array. Nonparametric linkage analysis was applied and Parkinson's disease (PD) polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were calculated for all the siblings, based on 107 known risk variants. All male and female siblings manifested similar kinetic tremor phenotypes. In contrast to FXTAS, they showed negligible gait ataxia, and few white matter lesions on MRI. Cognitive functioning was unaffected. Suggestive evidence of linkage to a broad region of the short arm of chromosome 10 was obtained, and median PD PRS for the sibship fell within the top 30% of a sample of over 500,000 UK and Australian controls. The genomewide study results are suggestive of modifying effects of genetic risk loci linked to PD, on the neurological phenotype of FMR1-CGG small expansion carriers, resulting in an oligosymptomatic kinetic tremor seen in FXTAS spectrum, but also consistent with essential tremor.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica subspecies I serotypes are responsible for the vast majority of salmonellosis in mammals and birds, yet only a few factors specific to this group that allow them to persist in this niche have been identified. We show that STM0557, a S. enterica subspecies I-specific gene encoding an inner membrane protein, is critical for faecal shedding and intestinal persistence of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium ATCC14028 in Salmonella-resistant mice, but mutations in this gene do not diminish short-term intestinal colonization or invasion of cultured epithelial cells. STM0557 and two neighbouring genes, located on a pathogenicity island termed SPI-16, resemble genes of the gtrA,B, gtr(type) cluster in seroconverting bacteriophages. In general, the gtr genes encode proteins responsible for serotype conversion of the infected bacterium by addition glucose residues to repeating O-antigen subunits of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In lysogenized Shigella, such modifications have been previously shown to be constitutively expressed and to facilitate invasion of host cells. We show that serotype Typhimurium gtr orthologues, STM0557-0559, are responsible for 'form variation' or glucosylation of the O12 antigen galactose (4 position) to generate the 12-2 variant. Form variation in Typhimurium is not constitutive, but occurred upon exposure and during intracellular growth of serotype Typhimurium in J774 macrophages. Our data suggest that the 12-2 antigen is a S. enterica subspecies I-specific LPS modification that enhances long-term intestinal colonization, and is in contrast to the role of O-antigen variation described for Shigella.",

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is frequently an immediate cause or precursor to homelessness and housing instability. The aim of the study is to explore abused women's experiences accessing affordable, safe, and stable housing. To achieve the aim, adult female IPV survivors answered questions about: 1) steps that were taken to secure housing; 2) safety issues after leaving the abuser; 3) barriers to obtaining housing; and 4) responses from housing and domestic violence advocacy systems related to survivors' housing needs. Four major themes emerged from the in-depth interviews: 1) stable, affordable housing is critical in increasing safety; 2) survivors face multiple systemic or individual barriers; 3) survivors develop and utilize an array of creative and resourceful strategies; and 4) survivors identified a variety of supportive services tailored to address their needs. The findings inform practice, policy and research for both the housing and domestic violence service systems with an emphasis on collaboration to meet the complex safety and stable housing needs of survivors and their families, particularly following the impact on housing of the 2008 U.S. economic crisis and subsequent recession.",

Inherited mutations in K5 or K14 result in epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a skin-fragility disorder. The impact that such mutations exert on the intrinsic mechanical properties of K5/K14 filaments is unknown. Here we show, by using differential interference contrast microscopy, that a 'hot-spot' mutation in K14 greatly reduces the ability of reconstituted mutant filaments to bundle under crosslinking conditions. Rheological assays measure similar small-deformation mechanical responses for crosslinked solutions of wild-type and mutant keratins. The mutation, however, markedly reduces the resilience of crosslinked networks against large deformations. Single-particle tracking, which probes the local organization of filament networks, shows that the mutant polymer exhibits highly heterogeneous structures compared to those of wild-type filaments. Our results indicate that the fragility of epithelial cells expressing mutant keratin may result from an impaired ability of keratin polymers to be crosslinked into a functional network.",

This study explored whether doctors and patients identify information likely to be tacit clues or judgements based on tacit clues during health maintenance examinations. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of video elicitation interview transcripts involving 18 community-based primary care doctors and 36 patients. Outcomes were description and analysis of tacit clues and judgements based on tacit clues mentioned by participants. RESULTS: A total of 57 references to tacit clues and 53 references to judgements based on tacit clues were identified from patient and doctor transcripts. Non-verbal behaviours comprised the most common category of tacit clues (53% of doctor comments; 42% of patient comments). Patients mostly discussed judgements based on tacit clues that related to the doctor-patient relationship. Doctors discussed actively using non-verbal behaviours to provide patients with tacit clues about the doctor-patient relationship. They also mentioned tacit clues that informed medical judgements and decision making. Gestalt judgements based on tacit clues were common (33% of doctor comments). Several participants identified instances in which they had difficulty articulating their rationale for specific judgements. Doctors varied widely in how frequently they mentioned tacit clues. CONCLUSION: During video elicitation interviews, patients and doctors identified tacit clues and judgements based on these clues as playing a role during health maintenance examinations. Future research should further elucidate the role of tacit clues in medical judgements and doctor-patient relationships.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies ‘tied mover’ men and women who are the partners of graduate students. We use qualitative data to explore the relocation decision-making process of married and unmarried partners. We find that, while many partners have educational and career aspirations of their own, the maintenance of the relationship is a strong priority that dictates how and when a tied move occurs. Furthermore, the decision-making process is varied and depends on the stage of the relationship. Tied movers at earlier points in their relationships often make independent decisions to join their graduate student partners after the student has already initiated the move. Some of those in more mature relationships follow a traditional mover–follower model, while others participate in joint decision-making about their destination. Finally, we find that over one-third of the tied movers are male, reflecting both increases in women's migration for graduate school and men's openness to ‘following’ career-oriented partners. This paper contributes to the study of family migration by developing a model focusing on individual and collective non-economic determinants of couples' decisions to migrate for skill development.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Face cleanliness is a core component of the SAFE (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvements) strategy for trachoma control. Understanding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to face washing may be helpful for designing effective interventions for improving facial cleanliness. METHODS: In April 2014, a mixed methods study including focus groups and a quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted in the East Gojjam zone of the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Participants were asked about face washing practices, motivations for face washing, use of soap (which may reduce bacterial load), and fly control strategies. RESULTS: Overall, both knowledge and reported practice of face washing was high. Participants reported they knew that washing their own face and their children's faces daily was important for hygiene and infection control. Although participants reported high knowledge of the importance of soap for face washing, quantitative data revealed strong variations by community in the use of soap for face washing, ranging from 4.4% to 82.2% of households reporting using soap for face washing. Cost and forgetfulness were cited as barriers to the use of soap for face washing. Keeping flies from landing on children was a commonly cited motivator for regular face washing, as was trachoma prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions aiming to improve facial cleanliness for trachoma prevention should focus on habit formation (to address forgetfulness) and address barriers to the use of soap, such as reducing cost. Interventions that focus solely on improving knowledge may not be effective for changing face-washing behaviors.",

    "abstract": "A major function shared by several types of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (IFs) is to stabilize cellular architecture against the mechanical forces it is subjected to. As for other fibrous cytoskeletal arrays, a crucial determinant of this function is the spatial organization of IFs in the cytoplasm. However, very few crossbridging proteins are specific for IFs - most IF-associated proteins known to exert a structural role act to tether IFs to other major cytoskeletal elements, such as F-actin, microtubules or adhesion complexes. In addition, IFs are endowed with the ability to participate in their own organization. This intriguing property is probably connected to the unusual degree of sequence diversity and sequence-specific regulation that characterize IF genes and their proteins. This dependence upon a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic determinants contributes to distinguish IFs from other fibrous cytoskeletal polymers and is key to their function.",

In particular, the presence and function of pores within Mb have attracted much recent attention. These pores can bind to Xe as well as to other ligands. Indeed, recent cryogenic X-ray crystallographic studies using novel techniques have captured snapshots of carbon monoxide (CO) migrating through these pores. The observed movement of the CO molecule from the heme iron site to the internal cavities and the associated structural changes of the amino acid residues around the cavities confirm the integral role of the pores in forming a ligand migration pathway from the protein surface to the heme. These observations resolve a long-standing controversy - but how these pores affect the physiological function of Mb poses a striking question at the frontier of biology.",

Plantlets develop symmetrically along the leaf margins on leaf notches, closely resembling zygotic embryos in development, and once the root system is formed, they detach from the mother-leaf, fall to the ground, and grow into new plants. This phenomenon is also found in other species from this same genus; however, the formation of leaf-plantlets is variable among species. Nevertheless, all species illustrate the remarkable ability of plant somatic cells to regenerate an entire organism, which has fascinated the scientific community for many years. It was only recently that the morphogenic process involved in the origin of K. daigremontiana plantlets was determined using molecular and genetic tools: K. daigremontiana forms plantlets by co-opting both organogenesis and embryogenesis programs into leaves. The ability of K. daigremontiana species to form somatic embryos outside of a seed environment provides an attractive model system to study somatic embryogenesis in nature, particularly the molecular mechanism involved in the acquisition of competence by vegetative cells to make embryos without fertilization.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 'Nebbiolo' is a grapevine cultivar typical of north-western Italy, appreciated for producing high-quality red wines. Grapevine cultivars are characterized by possessing highly heterozygous genomes, including a great incidence of genomic rearrangements larger than 50 bp, so called structural variations (SVs). Even though abundant, SVs are an under-explored source of genetic variation mainly due to methodological limitations at their detection. RESULTS: We employed a multiple platform approach to produce long-range genomic data for two different 'Nebbiolo' clones, namely: optical mapping, long-reads and linked-reads. We performed a haplotype-resolved de novo assembly for cultivar 'Nebbiolo' (clone CVT 71) and used an ab-initio strategy to annotate it. The annotated assembly enhanced our ability to detect SVs, enabling the study of genomic regions not present in the grapevines' reference genome and accounting for their functional implications. We performed variant calling analyses at three different organizational levels: i) between haplotypes of clone CVT 71 (primary assembly vs haplotigs), ii) between 'Nebbiolo' and 'Cabernet Sauvignon' assemblies and iii) between clones CVT 71 and CVT 185, representing different 'Nebbiolo' biotypes. The cumulative size of non-redundant merged SVs indicated a total of 79.6 Mbp for the first comparison and 136.1 Mbp for the second one, while no SVs were detected for the third comparison. Interestingly, SVs differentiating cultivars and haplotypes affected similar numbers of coding genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SVs accumulation rate and their functional implications in 'Nebbiolo' genome are highly-dependent on the organizational level under study. SVs are abundant when comparing 'Nebbiolo' to a different cultivar or the two haplotypes of the same individual, while they turned absent between the two analysed clones.",

    "abstract": "Many common metabolites are intrinsically unstable and reactive, and hence prone to chemical (i.e. non-enzymatic) damage in vivo Although this fact is widely recognized, the purely chemical side-reactions of metabolic intermediates can be surprisingly hard to track down in the literature and are often treated in an unprioritized case-by-case way. Moreover, spontaneous chemical side-reactions tend to be overshadowed today by side-reactions mediated by promiscuous ('sloppy') enzymes even though chemical damage to metabolites may be even more prevalent than damage from enzyme sloppiness, has similar outcomes, and is held in check by similar biochemical repair or pre-emption mechanisms. To address these limitations and imbalances, here we draw together and systematically integrate information from the (bio)chemical literature, from cheminformatics, and from genome-scale metabolic models to objectively define a 'Top 30' list of damage-prone metabolites. A foundational part of this process was to derive general reaction rules for the damage chemistries involved. The criteria for a 'Top 30' metabolite included predicted chemical reactivity, essentiality, and occurrence in diverse organisms. We also explain how the damage chemistry reaction rules ('operators') are implemented in the Chemical-Damage-MINE (CD-MINE) database (minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov/#/top30) to provide a predictive tool for many additional potential metabolite damage products. Lastly, we illustrate how defining a 'Top 30' list can drive genomics-enabled discovery of the enzymes of previously unrecognized damage-control systems, and how applying chemical damage reaction rules can help identify previously unknown peaks in metabolomics profiles.",

Yet none has considered the tour in musical terms, nor taken into account Spanish reaction. Drawing on coverage in the Republican press, along with recent work on vocality and identity, I argue that the tour challenged prior notions of blackness in Spain. Spanish journalists addressed Robeson’s singing from the standpoint of the ‘suspect whiteness of Spain’ (to borrow Fra-Molinero’s apt description) while Robeson himself linked blackness and flamenco and reformulated the ‘sorrow song,’ as W. E. B. Du Bois called the spiritual. I also analyse Robeson’s performances of ‘Ol’ Man River’ from the musical Show Boat in terms of Republic ideology. In sum, Robeson challenged Franco’s vision of ‘blood purity’ (limpieza de sangre) while calling for racial justice worldwide.",

Rather, Russian and British diplomats and travellers participated in a common culture of exploration, sharing a purpose and a European identity. This self-identification, in turn, was closely connected with the practice of exploration: objective measurement and scientific inquiry were coded as activities differentiating Russian and British travellers from the objects of their study.

    "abstract": "Numerous attributes render the domestic dog a highly pertinent model for cancer-associated gene discovery. We performed microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 60 spontaneous canine intracranial tumors to examine the degree to which dog and human patients exhibit aberrations of ancestrally related chromosome regions, consistent with a shared pathogenesis. Canine gliomas and meningiomas both demonstrated chromosome copy number aberrations (CNAs) that share evolutionarily conserved synteny with those previously reported in their human counterpart. Interestingly, however, genomic imbalances orthologous to some of the hallmark aberrations of human intracranial tumors, including chromosome 22/NF2 deletions in meningiomas and chromosome 1p/19q deletions in oligodendrogliomas, were not major events in the dog. Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, we identified highly recurrent CNAs in canine intracranial tumors for which the human orthologue has been reported previously at low frequency but which have not, thus far, been associated intimately with the pathogenesis of the tumor. The presence of orthologous CNAs in canine and human intracranial cancers is strongly suggestive of their biological significance in tumor development and/or progression. Moreover, the limited genetic heterogenity within purebred dog populations, coupled with the contrasting organization of the dog and human karyotypes, offers tremendous opportunities for refining evolutionarily conserved regions of tumor-associated genomic imbalance that may harbor novel candidate genes involved in their pathogenesis. A comparative approach to the study of canine and human intracranial tumors may therefore provide new insights into their genetic etiology, towards development of more sophisticated molecular subclassification and tailored therapies in both species.",

Four broad themes were explored: Parental concerns regarding dating, family communication about sexual issues, family rules about dating, and actual dating and sexual experiences. Consistent with traditional cultural views, female romantic involvement outside of marriage was described as potentially dishonourable to the family. Because US-style dating was seen as a violation of traditional courtship styles, most of the respondents’ families placed strict boundaries on adolescent sociosexual interaction. As a result, many respondents described adolescent experiences of dating characterized by tension and conflict, and reported vulnerability in eventual sexual encounters. In order to better understand the sexual behaviour of young Latina women in the USA, researchers must examine sexual socialization within the family of origin and take parents’ culturally-influenced beliefs and practises into account. © 2001 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

    "abstract": "Silage 'shrink' (i.e., loss of fresh chopped crop between ensiling and feedout) represents a nutrient loss which can degrade air quality as volatile carbon compounds, degrade surface waterways due to seepage, or degrade aquifers due to seepage. Virtually no research has documented shrink in large silage piles. The term 'shrink' is often ill defined, but can be expressed as losses of wet weight (WW), oven dry matter (oDM), and oDM corrected for volatiles lost in the drying oven (vcoDM). Corn silage piles (4 wedge, 2 rollover/wedge, 1 bunker) from 950 to 12,204 tonnes as built, on concrete (4), soil (2) and a combination (1) in California's San Joaquin Valley, using a bacterial inoculant, covered within 24 h with an oxygen barrier inner film and black/white outer plastic, fed out using large front end loaders through an electronic feed tracking system, and from the 2013 crop year, were used. Shrink as WW, oDM and vcoDM were 90±17, 68±18 and 28±21 g/kg, suggesting that much WW shrink is water and much oDM shrink is volatiles lost during analytical oven drying. Most shrink occurred in the silage mass with losses from exposed silage faces, as well as between exposed face silage removal and the total mixed ration mixer, being low. Silage bulk density, exposed silage face management and face use rate did not have obvious impacts on any shrink measure, but age of the silage pile during silage feedout impacted shrink losses ('older' silage piles being higher), but most strongly for WW shrink. Real shrink losses (i.e., vcoDM) of large well managed corn silage piles are low, the exposed silage face is a small portion of losses, and many proposed shrink mitigations appeared ineffective, possibly because shrink was low overall and they are largely directed at the exposed silage face.",

Among the few emerging generalizations is that beta diversity tends to increase with productivity; it remains to be determined whether the mechanism(s) involves habitat specialization or random factors in community assembly. We examined this question using the classic dataset of Whittaker (1960), who first defined beta diversity in a study of plant communities along multiple abiotic gradients related to productivity. With increasing productivity along climatic gradients (elevation or topography), though not a soil fertility gradient, we found increases in the levels of 'structured' beta diversity, i.e., the turnover associated with each of the other gradients, consistent with greater habitat specialization. 'Unstructured' beta diversity, i.e., the among-site variation not associated with gradients, varied idiosyncratically among different combinations of environmental factors. These results were robust to the use of either presence-absence or relative abundance data. We conclude that habitat specialization along gradients may tend to increase either with productivity itself, or with regional (gamma) diversity, which tends to be higher in more productive climates and conceivably 'spills over' in ecological or evolutionary time to enhance structured beta diversity. © 2011 Harrison et al.",

The purpose of this study was to explore how faculty teach social justice in theory courses in Baccalaureate programs. This qualitative study utilized constructivist grounded theory methods to examine processes informing participants' teaching. Participants utilize four overarching approaches: fostering engaging classroom climates, utilizing various naming strategies, framing diversity and culture as social justice, and role modeling a critical stance. They deploy specific strategies, varying largely by race, educational background, and nursing specialty. A background in social sciences supports pedagogy that interrogates health inequities rather than merely raising awareness about disparities. Findings also reveal that faculty of color navigate institutional structures predicated upon colorblind racism and problematic views of culture, which many white faculty teaching non-Community Health Nursing courses described doing. To enact social justice and be answerable to our communities, concerted anti-oppression efforts are needed across education, research, practice, and policy. This includes sustained commitment to address colonialism and whiteness in every institution that defines, promotes, and claims to advance nursing so that we can fulfill our responsibility to address unjust systems and structures to serve our communities.",

    "abstract": "This article examines a little-discussed phenomenon in the study of both peer-to-peer collaborative networks and teaching with technology: that of teachers caught in the middle between open public networks as teaching resources and highly restrictive school policies regarding internet content and online access. Based on their experiences as teacher-educators in graduate programs in educational technology and as facilitators of teacher professional development workshops on technology integration, the authors have collected numerous cases of teachers making use of different types of what are currently described as 'peer-to-peer' networks. One goal of this article is to introduce a more nuanced framework for how to characterize the kinds of resources and networks that teachers can make use of, adapting current terminology to include 'peer to peer', 'peer to public', and 'public to public'. Examples of the advantages and challenges of each type are described, with accompanying cases of actual teachers and their experiences. A second and related goal is more philosophical. Based on their framework and cases, the authors argue that neither the prevailing utopian rhetoric of grassroots social networks, nor critical protests against internet surveillance and control, are functionally adequate to describe the dilemmas teachers face when they try to find online resources they can actually share with their students in the classroom. The authors want to move beyond this polarizing rhetoric and toward a more pragmatic discussion of possibilities, including strategies for training teachers in how to work within (or even 'hack') their local and institutional constraints.",

Depletion of unlicensed NK cells impaired control of viral titers, but depletion of licensed NK cells did not. The transfer of unlicensed NK cells was more protective than was the transfer of licensed NK cells. Signaling by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 limited the proliferation of licensed NK cells but not that of unlicensed NK cells during infection.

Afterward, it presents a detailed overview of (Barbara’s father) Brumsic Brandon, Jr.’s works as an activist, animator, cartoonist and television personality on numerous concurrent projects. Next, a similar review of Barbara Brandon-Croft’s accomplishments is offered. These results are part of a study that answers the following research questions: (1) how doDeliveredstereotypesby Intellectinfluenceto: social interactions and communications amongst media industry professionals and stakeholders? (2) How have the social experiences, professional training and educational backgrounds of media industry professionals informed the choices they make in their specific roles within the media industry? The feature comic focuses on findings about Barbara’s formative years and incorpo-rates them into the narrative and illustrations. It serves as a preview of a graphic history book project that focuses on early moments in cartoonists’ lives. This book will illustrate the backstories that changed each cartoonist’s subjective world-view. It will reveal how these pivotal moments caused them to form beliefs that influence their reactions to stereotypes, their choice to tackle or avoid stereotypes and their decisions concerning how to use or portray stereotypes in their media projects.",

Our main objectives were to assess the feasibility of blinding: (1) participants randomly allocated to active or placebo spinal manual therapy (SMT), and (2) outcome assessors. We also explored blinding by levels of SMT lifetime experience and recent LBP, and factors contributing to beliefs about the assigned intervention. METHODS: A two-parallel-arm, single-centre, placebo-controlled, blinding feasibility trial. Adults were randomised to active SMT (n = 40) or placebo SMT (n = 41). Participants attended two study visits for their assigned intervention, on average seven days apart. The primary outcome was participant blinding (beliefs about assigned intervention) using the Bang blinding index (BI) at two study visits. The Bang BI is arm-specific, chance-corrected, and ranges from - 1 (all incorrect beliefs) to 1 (all correct beliefs), with 0 indicating equal proportions of correct and incorrect beliefs. Secondary outcomes included factors contributing to beliefs about the assigned intervention. RESULTS: Of 85 adults screened, 81 participants were randomised (41 [51%] with SMT lifetime experience; 29 [39%] with recent LBP), and 80 (99%) completed follow-up. At study visit 1, 50% of participants in the active SMT arm (Bang BI: 0.50 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.26 to 0.74]) and 37% in the placebo SMT arm (0.37 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.63]) had a correct belief about their assigned intervention, beyond chance. At study visit 2, BIs were 0.36 (0.08 to 0.64) and 0.29 (0.01 to 0.57) for participants in the active and placebo SMT arms, respectively. BIs among outcome assessors suggested adequate blinding at both study visits (active SMT: 0.08 [- 0.05 to 0.20] and 0.03 [- 0.11 to 0.16]; placebo SMT: - 0.12 [- 0.24 to 0.00] and - 0.07 [- 0.21 to 0.07]). BIs varied by participant levels of SMT lifetime experience and recent LBP. Participants and outcome assessors described different factors contributing to their beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate blinding of participants assigned to active SMT may not be feasible with the intervention protocol studied, whereas blinding of participants in the placebo SMT arm may be feasible. Blinding of outcome assessors seemed adequate. Further methodological work on blinding of SMT is needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05778396.",

A high-throughput LC/MS-ELSD based library approach of the extract in combination with the NF-κB and MTT assays revealed the styryl lactone (+)-altholactone (2) was responsible for the activity. Compound 2, its acetylated derivate (+)-3-O-acetylaltholactone (3), and the major compound of this class, (+)-goniothalmin (1), were further evaluated to determine their anti-inflammatory potential in the NF-κB assay. Concentration-response studies of 1-3 indicated that only 2 possessed NF-κB based anti-inflammatory activity. Compound 2 reduced the LPS-induced NO production, phosphorylation of IκBα, and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) using Western blot analysis. Further studies using qPCR indicated 2 reduced the expression of eight pro-inflammatory cytokines/enzymes (0.8-5.0μM) which included: COX-2, iNOS, IP-10, IL-1β, MCP-1, GCS-F, IL-6 and IFN-β. These results indicated that 2 displays broad spectrum immune modulating activity by functioning as an anti-inflammatory agent against LPS-induced NF-κB signaling. Conversely the selective cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity previously reported for 1 do not appear to arise from a mechanism that is linked to the NF-κB immune mediated pathway.",

However, its precise mechanism remains to be further studied. In this work, we investigated whether (+)-Borneol could improve the efficacy of EDA against DSS-induced colitis. We found that C.EDA at 7.5 and 15mg/kg could significantly relieve the disease activity index (DAI) and reduce the loss of body weight and colon length in a dose-dependent manner, while EDA or (+)-Borneol alone only had moderate effects even at the highest dose. Additionally, ELISA revealed that C.EDA could more dramatically decrease the protein levels of inflammatory cytokines and increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine than EDA or (+)-Borneol alone both in colon tissues and serum. H&E staining and IHC assay also indicated that C.EDA exhibited more prominent effects on increasing the population of M2 macrophages, decreasing M1 macrophages infiltration and protecting intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, in vitro studied demonstrated that C.EDA, EDA or (+)-Borneol failed in inhibiting M1 macrophages activation but could specifically induce the activation of M2 macrophages in a STAT3-dependent manner. Knockdown the expression of STAT3 successfully abolished the effect of C.EDA and EDA on promoting M2 macrophages activation. Consistent with in vivo study, C.EDA exhibited a more efficient ability of inducing M2 macrophages polarization and STAT3 activation than EDA or (+)-Borneol alone in vitro. In conclusion, we confirmed that (+)-Borneol improved the efficacy of EDA against DSS-induced colitis by promoting M2 macrophages polarization via JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Generated in intestinal L cells through cleavage of proglucagon (Gcg), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is secreted and rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). GLP-1 regulates insulin secretion and overall glucose homeostasis. The capacity of dietary bioactives to increase GLP-1 circulating levels, and therefore increase insulin secretion and glucose metabolism, has gained significant interest of late. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effects of (-)-epicatechin (EC) and different anthocyanins (ACs) and AC metabolites on GLP-1 metabolism in mice and on GLUTag cells. METHODS: We fed 6-week-old C57BL/6J male mice a control diet or a control diet supplemented with either 40 mg AC or 20 mg EC/kg body weight for 14 weeks (AC) or 15 weeks (EC). Intestinal mRNA levels of Gcg and Dpp-iv were measured. In vitro, GLUTag cells were incubated in the presence or absence of different ACs, the AC metabolite protocatechuic acid (PCA), and EC. GLP-1 secretion and the main pathways involved in its release were assessed. RESULTS: Long-term supplementation with EC or AC increased mouse GLP-1 plasma concentrations (55% and 98%, respectively; P < 0.05). In mice, 1) EC and AC increased Gcg mRNA levels in the ileum (91%) and colon (41%), respectively (P < 0.05); and 2) AC lowered ileum Dpp-iv mRNA levels (35%), while EC decreased plasma DPP-IV activity (15%; P < 0.05). In GLUTag cells, 1) cyanidin, delphinidin, PCA, and EC increased GLP-1 secretion (53%, 33%, 53%, and 68%, respectively; P < 0.05); and 2) cyanidin, delphinidin, EC, and PCA increased cyclin adenosine monophosphate levels (25-50%; P < 0.05) and activated protein kinase A (PKA; 100%, 50%, 80%, and 86%, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In mice, EC and ACs regulated different steps in GLP-1 regulation, leading to increased plasma GLP-1. Cyanidin, delphinidin, PCA, and EC promoted GLP-1 secretion from GLUTag cells by activating the PKA-dependent pathway. These findings support the beneficial actions of these flavonoids in sustaining intestinal and glucose homeostasis through the modulation of the GLP-1 metabolism.",

The flavanol-3-ol (-)-epicatechin (EC) can improve insulin sensitivity both in humans and animal models of T2D. NADPH oxidases and oxidative stress can contribute to the development of insulin resistance. This study investigated the capacity of EC and EC metabolites (ECM) to downregulate NADPH oxidases and oxidative stress, and its association to an improvement of insulin sensitivity. This was studied in in vivo (high fat-fed mice) and in vitro (HepG2 cells) conditions of hepatic lipid overload. EC decreased NOX3/NOX4 liver expression and mitigated oxidative stress in high fat-fed mice. In HepG2 cells, incubation with palmitate increased: i) lipid deposition, ii) NOX3/NOX4 expression, iii) NADPH oxidase activity, and iv) oxidative stress; promoting v) the activation of redox-sensitive kinases (JNK and IKK), and vi) impaired insulin responses. Physiological concentrations of EC and ECM, and NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin, VAS2870) prevented all those deleterious effects of palmitate. The obtained results points to NADPH oxidases as an important target in the capacity of EC to improve insulin sensitivity in conditions of liver lipid overload, as those associated with Western-style diets.",

While EC prevented high fat diet-induced intestinal permeabilization in mice, it did not mitigate the associated increase in fecal/cecal total and individual bile acids. In vitro, using differentiated Caco-2 cells as a model of epithelial barrier, EC and other NADPH oxidase inhibitors (VAS-2870 and apocynin) mitigated DCA-induced Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization. While EC inhibited DCA-mediated increase in cell oxidants, it did not prevent DCA-induced mitochondrial oxidant production. Prevention of DCA-induced ERK1/2 activation with EC, VAS-2870, apocynin and the MEK inhibitor U0126, also prevented monolayer permeabilization, stressing the key involvement of ERK1/2 in this process and its redox regulation. Downstream, DCA promoted myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation which was related to MLC phosphatase (MLCP) inhibition by ERK1/2. DCA also decreased the levels of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, which can be related to MMP-2 activation and consequent ZO-1 and occludin degradation. Both events were prevented by EC, NADPH oxidase and ERK1/2 inhibitors. Thus, DCA-induced Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization occurs mainly secondary to a redox-regulated ERK1/2 activation and downstream disruption of TJ structure and dynamic. EC's capacity to mitigate in vivo the gastrointestinal permeabilization caused by consumption of high-fat diets can be in part related to its capacity to inhibit bile-induced NADPH oxidase and ERK1/2 activation.",

Jurkat T cells were subjected to a Ca(2+) mobilization challenge by replacing Na(+) with K(+) in the incubation media. A 249+/-38% increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was observed and that effect was prevented by the presence of inhibitors of Ca(2+) mobilization and entrance. The pre-incubation of the cells in the presence of EC, B2 or C1 prevented K(+)-mediated increase in [Ca(2+)](i). IC(50) were 10, 24 and 196 nMfor EC, B2 and C1, respectively. Cell membrane depolarization was affected by K(+), but neither inhibitors of Ca(2+) mobilization nor EC, B2 or C1 modified the increase in membrane potential. An 84+/-7% increase in cell oxidants was observed after cell exposure to K(+). This increase was prevented by the inhibition of Ca(2+) mobilization, NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C, as well as by 10 nM EC, 10 nM B2 or 100 nM C1. In addition, EC and B2 (100 nM) significantly inhibited the activation of the [Ca(2+)](i)-regulated transcription factor NFAT. These results indicate that EC and related oligomers, assayed at physiologically achievable concentrations, can modulate [Ca(2+)](i) and then prevent cell oxidation and other Ca(2+)-regulated events.",

Evidence from studies in humans and experimental animals suggest that consumption of the flavan-3-ol (-)-epicatechin (EC) and of EC-rich foods may improve insulin sensitivity. To further understand the potential benefits of dietary EC consumption on insulin resistance, this study investigated the capacity of EC supplementation to prevent high fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance in mice. To assess the underlying mechanisms, the effects of HFD and EC consumption on the activation of the insulin cascade and of its negative modulators were evaluated. HFD consumption for 15 w caused obesity and insulin resistance in C57BL/6J mice as evidenced by high fasted and fed plasma glucose and insulin levels, and impaired ITT and GTT tests. This was associated with alterations in the activation of components of the insulin-triggered signaling cascade (insulin receptor, IRS1, ERK1/2, Akt) in adipose and liver tissues. EC supplementation prevented/ameliorated all these parameters. EC acted improving insulin sensitivity in the HFD-fed mice in part through a downregulation of the inhibitory molecules JNK, IKK, PKC and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Thus, the above results suggest that consumption of EC-rich foods could constitute a dietary strategy to mitigate obesity-associated insulin resistance.",

In humans, supplementation with EC-rich foods, extracts, and pure EC improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in normal weight, overweight, obese and T2D individuals. These effects of EC are also observed in rodent models of diet-induced obesity and T2D. The events involved in the development of insulin resistance and T2D are multiple and interrelated. EC has been shown to inhibit inflammation, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function, and to regulate events in the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas that impact glucose homeostasis. A downregulation of oxidant production, particularly through direct inhibition or suppression of NADPH oxidase expression, and of redox sensitive signals (NF-κB, JNK1/2) that inhibit the insulin pathway, appear to be central to the beneficial actions of EC on insulin sensitivity. Overall, EC seems to have a positive role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, however definitive answers on its importance for the management of T2D will depend on further clinical and mechanistic studies.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence demonstrates that consumption of high fat diet (HFD) and subsequent development of obesity leads to alterations in cognition and mood. While obesity can affect brain function, consumption of select dietary bioactives may help prevent obesity-related cognitive decline. This study investigated the capacity of the dietary flavonoid (-)-epicatechin (EC) to mitigate HFD-induced obesity-associated alterations in memory and mood. Healthy 8-week old male C57BL/6J mice were maintained on either a control diet (10 kCal% from fat) or a HFD (45 kCal% from fat) and were supplemented with EC at 2 or 20 mg/kg body weight (B.W.) for a 24 week period. Between week 20 and 22, anxiety-related behavior, recognition memory, and spatial memory were measured. Underlying mechanisms were assessed by measuring the expression of selected genes in the hippocampus and by 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis of the gut microbiota. 24 weeks of HFD feeding resulted in obesity, which was not affected by EC supplementation. HFD-associated increase in anxiety-related behavior was mitigated by EC in a dose-response manner and was accompanied by increased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as partial or full restoration of glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) expression. Higher EC dosage (20 mg/kg B.W.) also restored aberrant Lactobacillus and Enterobacter abundance altered by HFD and/or the associated obesity. Together, these results demonstrate how EC mitigates anxiety-related behaviors, revealing a connection between BDNF- and glucocorticoids-mediated signaling. Our findings link changes in the hippocampus and the gut microbiota in a context of HFD-induced obesity and anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Increased permeability of the intestinal barrier is proposed as an underlying factor for obesity-associated pathologies. Consumption of high fat diets (HFD) is associated with increased intestinal permeabilization and increased paracellular transport of endotoxins which can promote steatosis and insulin resistance. This study investigated whether dietary (-)-epicatechin (EC) supplementation can protect the intestinal barrier against HFD-induced permeabilization and endotoxemia, and mitigate liver damage and insulin resistance. Mechanisms leading to loss of integrity and function of the tight junction (TJ) were characterized. Consumption of a HFD for 15 weeks caused obesity, steatosis, and insulin resistance in male C57BL/6J mice. This was associated with increased intestinal permeability, decreased expression of ileal TJ proteins, and endotoxemia. Supplementation with EC (2-20mg/kg body weight) mitigated all these adverse effects. EC acted modulating cell signals and the gut hormone GLP-2, which are central to the regulation of intestinal permeability. Thus, EC prevented HFD-induced ileum NOX1/NOX4 upregulation, protein oxidation, and the activation of the redox-sensitive NF-κB and ERK1/2 pathways. Supporting NADPH oxidase as a target of EC actions, in Caco-2 cells EC and apocynin inhibited tumor necrosis alpha (TNFα)-induced NOX1/NOX4 overexpression, protein oxidation and monolayer permeabilization. Together, our findings demonstrate protective effects of EC against HFD-induced increased intestinal permeability and endotoxemia. This can in part underlie EC capacity to prevent steatosis and insulin resistance occurring as a consequence of HFD consumption.",

Here, hematite nanocrystals were synthesized with continuous tuning of the aspect-ratio and fine control of the surface area ratio of the (0001) facet with respect to other surfaces. The samples were doped with nickel, which was confirmed using the combined results of HRTEM, SEM, XRD, Raman, BET, and XPS measurements. The surface area ratio of the hexagonal (0001) surface with respect to all surfaces was tuned from 98% to 30%. Ni doping was accomplished by diffusion of Ni clusters into the subsurface region, which forms a uniformly doped NixFe2-xO3 surface overlayer that improves the electrocatalytic activity of water oxidation. These results are discussed in the context of a theoretical prediction and subsequent surface science validation that Ni doping facilitates the water oxidation reaction on hematite (0001) surfaces. Electrochemical testing of water oxidation catalysis was carried out on doped and shape-controlled hematite nanocrystals. The enhancement of water oxidation activity by Ni-doping increased as the surface area ratio of the (0001) facet of hematite nanocrystals increased, consistent with the theoretical predictions and surface science studies.",

Here we show that a sesquiterpene alcohol mediates attraction of Cyclocephala paraguayensis Arrow, on bottle gourd flowers, Lagenaria siceraria (Cucurbitaceae). Both males and females started to aggregate on the flowers at twilight; after that, mating began and remained for the entire night. GC-FID/EAD analysis of the L. siceraria floral scent collected in the field revealed that only the major constituent of the airborne volatiles elicited electroantennographic responses on male and female antennae of C. paraguayensis. This compound was identified as (3S,6E)-nerolidol, which was tested in two field trapping trials in Brazil. In the first bioassay, traps baited with nerolidol (mix of isomers) captured significantly more adult C. paraguayensis than control traps. In the second field trial, catches in traps baited with a mixture of isomers or enantiopure nerolidol were significantly higher than captures in control traps, but the treatments did not differ significantly. Analysis from the gut content of adult C. paraguayensis showed the presence of pollen, suggesting that they also use bottle gourd flowers for their nourishment. Taken together, these results suggest that (3S,6E)-nerolidol plays an essential role in the reproductive behavior of C. paraguayensis by eliciting aggregation, mating, and feeding.",

    "abstract": "The human fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene contains a polymorphic (CGG) trinucleotide repeat element in its 5' untranslated region. Expansion of the (CGG)n element beyond 200 repeats (full mutation range) generally leads to transcriptional silencing; consequent loss of the FMR1 protein (FMRP) results in fragile X syndrome, the most frequent form of inherited mental impairment. For carriers of smaller expansions (55< or =n< or =200; premutation range), FMRP levels are gradually reduced with increasing repeat number, despite elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, suggesting that translation is impeded within the premutation range. To examine in more detail the influence of the CGG repeat on translation, CMV immediate-early promoter constructs, containing the FMR1 5'-UTR with various (CGG)n repeat lengths (0< or =n< or =99) and a downstream (luciferase) reporter, were transfected into two human cell lines, a neural cell-derived line (SK) and a fetal kidney cell-derived line (293). For both cell types, the CGG element exerts distinct effects on reporter expression, depending on the length of the repeat. For n> or =30, luciferase expression decreases with increasing repeat length, consistent with earlier observations of decreased FMRP expression in peripheral blood leucocytes over the same repeat range, despite a slight increase in mRNA level for the larger repeats. Surprisingly, for smaller alleles (0< or =n< or =30), reporter expression actually increases by nearly two-fold with increasing repeat length in the absence of any change in mRNA level. These results suggest that the CGG repeat element can exert both positive (n<30) and negative (n>30) effects on translation. Interestingly, optimal translation appears to occur near the modal repeat number within the general human population.",

    "abstract": "Drawing inspiration from the work of Robin M. Williams Jr., I map out the complexities of ethnic and racial relations in the contemporary United States by focusing on the impacts of 9/11 - particularly in relation to immigration policy. Because the attackers entered the country through regular immigration channels (i.e., as foreign students) the U.S. government has introduced policies to enhance border security, restrict immigration, increase the surveillance of immigrant populations, and more actively enforce immigration policy. These national-security-related immigration policies, however, are exacerbating existing tensions and producing new sets of ethnic and racialized conflicts in the United States. In this article, I first provide an overview of the key national-security-related immigration policies that were passed in the wake of September 11, 2001. Then, I review some of the recent sociological literature, as well as draw from my own preliminary research in the State of New Jersey, to illustrate the social impacts of these policies on ethnic and racial relations. I conclude with an outline of the ways the sociology of ethnic and racial relations specifically, as well as other subfields of the discipline, might approach analyses of social conflict in the contemporary United States, post-September 11. © 2008 Eastern Sociological Society.",

To date, magneto-ionics have been mostly explored in oxygen-based systems [1-4], while there is a surge of interest in alternative ionic systems due to their different ionic migration mechanisms and characteristics [5-7].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We have recently demonstrated effective MI control of magnetic functionalities using a variety of ionic species, particularly nitrogen. In nitride-based Ta/CoFe/MnN/Ta films, the chemically induced MI effect is combined with the electric field driving of nitrogen to electrically manipulate exchange bias [8]. Upon field-cooling the heterostructure, ionic diffusion of nitrogen from MnN into the Ta layers occurs. A significant exchange bias is observed, which can be further enhanced by ~ 20% after voltage conditioning (Figs. 1a-1e). This enhancement can be reversed by voltage conditioning with an opposite polarity. Nitrogen migration within the MnN layer and into the Ta capping layer causes the enhancement in exchange bias, which is observed in polarized neutron reflectometry studies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We have also achieved all-nitride-based magneto-ionic systems [9].

Furthermore, we have demonstrated MI control of the exchange bias effect in an all-nitride Mn<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>N/MnN<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> system, where the field-trained exchange field can be varied up to ten times by introducing or extracting nitrogen from the nitride system.

In a second example of net two-electron chemistry, outer sphere oxidation of M(+)[(IP(2-))(2)Ga](-) using either 1 or 2 equiv of the one-electron oxidant ferrocenium afforded [(IP(-))(2)Ga](+) (3) in either 44 or 87% yield, respectively. Reaction with 1 equiv of TEMPO, a one-electron oxidant, afforded the two-electron-oxidized product (IP(-))(2)Ga(TEMPO) (4). Reduction of 2IP by 3Na and subsequent reaction with GaCl(3) yielded a 1:1 mixture of (IP(-))(2)GaCl and 1. Most remarkably, all of these reactions are overall two-electron processes and only the (IP(-))(2)GaX and [(IP(2-))(2)Ga](-) oxidation states are thermodynamically accessible to us. Analogous aluminum chemistry previously afforded either one-electron or two-electron reactions and mixed-valent states. The thermodynamic accessibility of the mixed-valent states of (IP(2-))(IP(-))E, where E = Al or Ga, can be compared using cyclic voltammetry measurements. These measurements indicated that the mixed-valent state [(IP(2-))(IP(-))Ga](+) is not significantly stabilized with respect to disproportionation on the time scale of the electrochemistry experiment. The electrochemically observed differences in thermodynamic stability of the mixed-valent state [(IP(2-))(IP(-))E](+) can be rationalized by the observation that the dihedral angle between the ligand planes containing the π-system of IP is roughly 5° larger in all gallium complexes compared with aluminum analogs. Presumably, a larger dihedral angle provides weaker electronic coupling between the π-systems of IP via the E-X σ* orbital. Alternatively, the observed difference may be a result of the \"inert pair effect\": a contracted Ga component in the E-X σ* orbital would also afford weaker electronic coupling.",

Although past evidence suggests some ways to minimize it, there are no easily applicable interventions that have been found to work in the increasingly polarized climate. This project examines whether irrelevant factors, or incidental happiness more specifically, have the power to reduce affective polarization (i.e., misattribution of affect or \"carryover effect\"). On the flip side, happiness can minimize systematic processing, thus enhancing beliefs in conspiracy theories and impeding individual ability to recognize deep fakes. Three preregistered survey experiments in the US, Poland, and the Netherlands (total N = 3611) induced happiness in three distinct ways. Happiness had no effects on affective polarization toward political outgroups and hostility toward various divisive social groups, and also on endorsement of conspiracy theories and beliefs that a deep fake was real. Two additional studies in the US and Poland (total N = 2220), also induced anger and anxiety, confirming that all these incidental emotions had null effects. These findings, which emerged uniformly in three different countries, among different partisan and ideological groups, and for those for whom the inductions were differently effective, underscore the stability of outgroup attitudes in contemporary America and other countries.

This paper examines exposure to local and national news media websites, side-by-side in one model, testing their over-time effects on political participation, knowledge, and affective and attitude polarization. We test whether traditionally disengaged or disadvantaged groups (i.e., racial minorities, those with low education levels, politically disinterested, and those who do not consume national news), may particularly benefit from local news consumption. To this end, we combine three-wave panel surveys (final N = 740) with 9 months worth of web browsing data submitted by the same participants (36 million visits). We identify exposure to local and national news sites using an extensive list of news domains. The results offer a robust pattern of null findings. Actual online exposure to local news has no over-time effects on the tested outcomes. Also, exposure to local news sites does not exert especially strong effects among the tested sub-groups. We attribute these results to the fact that news visits account for a small fraction of citizens’ online activities, less than 2% in our trace data. Our project suggests the need to evaluate the effects of local news consumption on the individual level.",

The scope and ambition of the system had been expected to set an example for other states and countries about the efficacy and revenue potential of cap-and-trade systems. However, despite achieving its emissions reductions targets at lower than expected costs, the system has been considered a disappointment in the political arena. A major source of disillusionment with the California system has been its failure to generate the expected amount of revenues that would have contributed to a wide range of public expenditures.

However, when evaluating psychologically near targets, concrete contextual details of the environment (e.g., how a target's behavior affects self-evaluations in the moment) may determine individuals' attraction toward targets.

    "abstract": "An active component of the sex pheromone system of the yellowish elongate chafer, Heptophylla picea was identified by GC-EAD. Mass spectral data and hydrogenation revealed that the active compound was a hexadecadien-4-olide. It was not possible to determine the double bond positions by direct DMDS derivatization of the pheromone, but partial hydrogenation (diimide) followed by DMDS derivatization showed that the double bonds were located in positions 7 and 15. FTIR (tracer) of the pheromone corroborated the lactone structure (1772 cm-1) and showed a band characteristic of a terminal double bond at 3073 cm-1, and one of a double bond in the cis-configuration at 3002 cm-1. Chiral resolution of the pheromone, after hydrogenation, demonstrated that the natural lactone had the (R)-stereochemistry. Synthetic (R,Z)-7,15-hexadecadien-4-olide, prepared from L-malic acid in 14 steps, was identical to the natural product in MS, IR, retention times and biological activity. This is the first fatty acid derivative compound found as a sex pheromone of a Melolonthinae species and as far as biosynthesis is concerned this is the most complex pheromone constituent of a scarab species.",

    "abstract": "Achieving affordable and equitable access to water for all remains a challenge worldwide. In areas suffering from chronic water shortages, communities pay high costs for alternative informal water sources (such as tanker trucks, bottled water, and wells) to meet their daily water needs. This study examines water costs of informal sources and overall affordability disparities for two communities of different socioeconomic status in Beirut, Lebanon. Water is often unaffordable for both of these communities. Overall, 6% of household income is spent on purchasing water (compared to an average global percentages of 3% to 5%). There are also significant disparities between the communities: lower income residents pay 2.2 times more of their income to secure water, and more than half of these residents (55% of households) spend more than 5% of their income on water. To overcome water shortages, these residents turn to informal water sources, but at significant additional cost. These costs and impacts on lower income residents are high and inequitable. We propose strategies to address cost, quality and quantity issues for informal sources.",

    "abstract": "Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) faces substantial challenges in increasingly saturated and competitive markets in which competitors highlight their localness. Retention of members is crucial for the model to provide benefits to farmers; otherwise, excessive losses of members requires considerable recruitment efforts and undercuts farmer well-being. We conducted statewide research on CSAs in California, including surveys of 409 former members, 1149 current members, and 111 CSA farmers, to examine former members' reasons for leaving. We answer three questions: How do former and current members differ in their satisfaction with CSA? Why do former members leave their CSAs? And, does share customization increase retention rates? Examining the datasets together shows what we call the CSA customization paradox: while it appears that former members' primary reasons for leaving could be addressed by offering them share customization, the farm-level data shows that offering share customization has no effect on CSAs' retention rates. The discussion offers three hypotheses to further examine the CSA customization paradox, and argues for a deeper theorization of CSA people to understand the limitations of share customization as a strategy for member retention. We conclude with specific routes that CSAs can take, individually and collectively, to retain members and cultivate CSA people.",

Changes in dietary habits and lifestyle could contribute to mitigate the development and/or progression of these pathologies. This review will discuss current evidence on the beneficial actions of the flavan-3-ol (-)-epicatechin (EC) on obesity-associated comorbidities. These benefits can be in part explained through EC's capacity to mitigate several common events underlying the development of these pathologies, including: i) high circulating levels of glucose, lipids and endotoxins; ii) chronic systemic inflammation; iii) tissue endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress; iv) insulin resistance; v) mitochondria dysfunction and vi) dysbiosis. The currently known underlying mechanisms and cellular targets of EC's beneficial effects are discussed. While, there is limited evidence from human studies supplementing with pure EC, other studies involving cocoa supplementation in humans, pure EC in rodents and in vitro studies, support a potential beneficial action of EC on obesity-associated comorbidities. This evidence also stresses the need of further research in the field, which would contribute to the development of human dietary strategies to mitigate the adverse consequences of obesity.",

    "abstract": "An increased permeability of the intestinal barrier is proposed as a major event in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Tumor necrosis alpha (TNFα) plays a central role in IBD pathogenesis, in part promoting tight function (TJ) barrier dysfunction. Food extracts enriched in (-)-epicatechin (EC) prevent the development or improve the progression of IBD in animal models. This study investigated the capacity of EC to inhibit TNFα-induced permeabilization of Caco-2 cell monolayers, characterizing the underlying mechanisms. Caco-2 cells differentiated into intestinal epithelial cells were incubated in the absence/presence of TNFα, with or without the addition of 0.5-5 μM EC. TNFα triggered cell monolayer permeabilization, decreasing transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increasing the paracellular transport of fluorescein sulfonic acid. The permeabilizing effects of TNFα were not due to Caco-2 cell apoptosis as evaluated by DNA fragmentation, caspase 3 and 9 activation, and cell morphology. EC prevented TNFα-triggered Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization and acted inhibiting the associated: (i) NADPH oxidase (NOX)-mediated increased oxidant production, (ii) NF-κB (IκBα phosphorylation, p50 and RelA nuclear transport, and nuclear NF-κB-DNA binding) and ERK1/2 activation, (iii) increased myosin light kinase expression, and decreased TJ protein ZO-1 levels. In summary, EC prevented TNFα-mediated Caco-2 cell barrier permeabilization in part through the inhibition of NOX/NF-κB activation and downstream TJ disruption. Diets rich in EC could contribute to ameliorate IBD-associated increased intestinal permeability.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We conducted an open-label study to examine the effects of the flavonoid (-)-epicatechin in seven ambulatory adult patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). METHODS: Seven participants received (-)-epicatechin 50 mg twice per day for 8 weeks. Pre- and postprocedures included biceps brachii biopsy to assess muscle structure and growth-relevant endpoints by western blotting, mitochondria volume measurement, and cristae abundance by electron microscopy, graded exercise testing, and muscle strength and function tests. RESULTS: Western blotting showed significantly increased levels of enzymes modulating cellular bioenergetics (liver kinase B1 and 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha, a transcriptional coactivator of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cristae-associated mitofilin levels, increased as did cristae abundance. Muscle and plasma follistatin increased significantly while myostatin decreased. Markers of skeletal muscle regeneration myogenin, myogenic regulatory factor-5, myoblast determination protein 1, myocyte enhancer factor-2, and structure-associated proteins, including dysferlin, utrophin, and intracellular creatine kinase, also increased. Exercise testing demonstrated decreased heart rate, maximal oxygen consumption per kilogram, and plasma lactate levels at defined workloads. Tissue saturation index improved in resting and postexercise states. DISCUSSION: (-)-Epicatechin, an exercise mimetic, appears to have short-term positive effects on tissue biomarkers indicative of mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle regeneration, and produced improvements in graded exercise testing parameters in patients with BMD.",

Adolescent rats were fed a regular chow diet without or with high fructose (HFr; 10% w/v) in drinking water for 8 weeks, and a group of HFr-fed rats was supplemented with EC in the diet. HFr-fed rats developed insulin resistance, which was mitigated by EC supplementation. Accordingly, the activation of components of the insulin signaling cascade (insulin receptor, IRS1, Akt, and ERK1/2) was impaired, whereas negative regulators (PKC, IKK, JNK, and PTP1B) were upregulated in the liver and adipose tissue of HFr rats. These alterations were partially or totally prevented by EC supplementation. In addition, EC inhibited events that contribute to insulin resistance: HFr-associated increased expression and activity of NADPH oxidase, activation of redox-sensitive signals, expression of NF-κB-regulated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and some sub-arms of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling. Collectively, these findings indicate that EC supplementation can mitigate HFr-induced insulin resistance and are relevant for defining interventions that can prevent/mitigate MetS-associated insulin resistance.",

Inflammation plays a significant role in metabolic regulation and mounting evidence highlight the contribution of adipose tissue to systemic inflammatory state. Food extracts with a high content of (-)-epicatechin have been found to exert systemic anti-inflammatory actions, however the anti-inflammatory actions of (-)-epicatechin on adipose tissue remain to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of (-)-epicatechin to prevent tumor necrosis alpha (TNFα)-induced activation of cell signals involved in inflammation and insulin resistance (NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), AP-1, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ)) in differentiated white adipocytes (3T3-L1). TNFα triggered the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, and MAPKs ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. (-)-Epicatechin caused a dose (0.5-10 μM)-dependent decrease in TNFα-mediated JNK, ERK1/2, and p-38 phosphorylation, and nuclear AP-1-DNA binding. (-)-Epicatechin also inhibited TNFα-triggered activation of the NF-κB signaling cascade, preventing TNFα-mediated p65 nuclear transport and nuclear NF-κB-DNA binding. (-)-Epicatechin also attenuated the TNFα-mediated downregulation of PPARγ expression and decreased nuclear DNA binding. Accordingly, (-)-epicatechin inhibited TNFα-mediated altered transcription of genes (MCP-1, interleukin-6, TNFα, resistin, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B) involved in inflammation and insulin signaling. In conclusion, (-)-epicatechin can attenuate TNFα-mediated triggering of signaling cascades involved in inflammation and insulin resistance. These findings could be of relevance in the dietary management of obesity and metabolic syndrome.",

Unfortunately, its toxic side effects, including gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, affect treatment compliance and patients' prognosis. Thus, there is a critical need of evaluating strategies that may improve the associated GI toxicity induced by CTX. In this work, we evaluated the capacity of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major constituent of green tea, to improve the recovery of gut injury induced by CTX in mice. Treatment with CTX for 5 days severely damaged the intestinal structure, increased immune-related cytokines (TNFα, IL-10 and IL-21), reduced the expression levels of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1), induced reactive oxygen species, altered the composition of gut microbiota, and reduced short chain fatty acid levels. EGCG treatment, starting one day after the last CTX dose, significantly improved the intestinal structure, ameliorated gut permeability, and restored ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 levels. Moreover, EGCG reduced TNFα, IL-10 and IL-21 levels and decreased oxidative stress by regulating the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Finally, EGCG treatment restored the composition of gut microbiota and the levels of the short chain fatty acids. In conclusion, these findings indicate that EGCG may function as an effective bioactive compound to minimize CTX-induced GI tract toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Frequent involvement of the disc in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders warrants attempts to tissue engineer TMJ disc replacements. Physiologically, a great degree of similarity is seen between humans and farm pigs (FPs), but the pig's rapid growth confers a significant challenge for in vivo experiments. Minipigs have a slower growth rate and are smaller than FPs, but minipig TMJ discs have yet to be fully characterized. The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of the minipig for TMJ studies by extensive structural and functional characterization. The properties of minipig TMJ discs closely reproduced previously reported morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical values of human and FP discs. The width/length dimension ratio of the minipig TMJ disc was 1.95 (1.69 for human and 1.94 for FP). The biochemical evaluation revealed, on average per wet weight, 24.3% collagen (22.8% for human and 24.9% for FP); 0.8% glycosaminoglycan (GAG; 0.5% for human and 0.4% for FP); and 0.03% DNA (0.008% for human and 0.02% for FP). Biomechanical testing revealed, on average, compressive relaxation modulus of 50 kPa (37 kPa for human and 32 kPa for FP), compressive instantaneous modulus of 1121 kPa (1315 kPa for human and 1134 kPa for FP), and coefficient of viscosity of 13 MPa·s (9 MPa·s for human and 3 MPa·s for FP) at 20% strain. These properties also varied topographically in accordance to those of human and FP TMJ discs. Anisotropy, quantified by bidirectional tensile testing and histology, again was analogous among minipig, human, and FP TMJ discs. The minipig TMJ's ginglymoarthrodial nature was verified through cone beam computer tomography. Collectively, the similarities between minipig and human TMJ discs support the use of minipig as a relevant model for TMJ research; considering the practical advantages conferred by its growth rate and size, the minipig may be a preferred model over FP.",

    "abstract": "Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide exciting opportunities to collect large volumes of running biomechanics data in the real world. IMU signals may, however, be affected by variation in the initial IMU placement or movement of the IMU during use. To quantify the effect that changing an IMU's location has on running data, a reference IMU was 'correctly' placed on the shank, pelvis, or sacrum of 74 participants. A second IMU was 'misplaced' 0.05 m away, simulating a 'worst-case' misplacement or movement. Participants ran over-ground while data were simultaneously recorded from the reference and misplaced IMUs. Differences were captured as root mean square errors (RMSEs) and differences in the absolute peak magnitudes and timings. RMSEs were ≤1 g and ~1 rad/s for all axes and misplacement conditions while mean differences in the peak magnitude and timing reached up to 2.45 g, 2.48 rad/s, and 9.68 ms (depending on the axis and direction of misplacement). To quantify the downstream effects of these differences, initial and terminal contact times and vertical ground reaction forces were derived from both the reference and misplaced IMU. Mean differences reached up to -10.08 ms for contact times and 95.06 N for forces. Finally, the behavior in the frequency domain revealed high coherence between the reference and misplaced IMUs (particularly at frequencies ≤~10 Hz). All differences tended to be exaggerated when data were analyzed using a wearable coordinate system instead of a segment coordinate system. Overall, these results highlight the potential errors that IMU placement and movement can introduce to running biomechanics data.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate effects of the 0.19-mg fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) intravitreal implant (ILUVIEN) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a 36-month, phase IV, nonrandomized, open-label, observational study. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 202 eyes from 159 patients who received the 0.19-mg FAc implant after a successful prior steroid challenge per the United States label indication. METHODS: Study eyes were assessed for IOP values, incidence of IOP elevations, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) for up to 36 months post-FAc implant. RESULTS: Mean IOP was stable over 36 months post-FAc; IOP change from baseline peaked at 2.12 mmHg at 9 months, then declined to baseline levels. At 36 months, eyes had a 32.5% cumulative probability of an IOP event > 25 mmHg and a 15.6% probability of an IOP event > 30 mmHg (Kaplan-Meier). The probability of requiring IOP-lowering medication at any time by month 36 was 38.3%. A total of 78% of eyes did not have IOP elevations > 25 mmHg if similar values were seen with the previous steroid challenge. Although 7.4% of eyes had an IOP > 30 mmHg during a scheduled study visit, most exceeded this threshold only once (60%). Regardless of IOP status, mean BCVA remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Over 36 months, the 0.19-mg FAc implant was associated with relatively stable IOPs in patients with DME, and there was no significant impact of IOP elevations identified regarding their effects on long-term visual outcomes. The probability that a prior corticosteroid challenge will not predict an IOP elevation > 25 mmHg over 36 months post-FAc is 22%; therefore, routine IOP monitoring should be scheduled.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a 0.34-THz 2× 2 phased array integrated circuit is presented, which demonstrates a new approach for implementing phased arrays in the millimeter-wave (mm-wave)/terahertz (THz) spectrum. The circuit structure consists of four unit standing wave oscillators. In each cell, fundamental frequency (f0) and odd harmonics are systematically cancelled, while the desired fourth harmonics (4f0) are combined and radiated by on-chip patch antennas. A phase-shifter-less mechanism is employed based on combining standing and traveling waves to create the required phase shift between the sources for beam steering. The transistors provide negative resistance to the circuit and generate the desired fourth harmonics through nonlinearity. Simultaneously, transistors are employed as active variable capacitors for varactor-less frequency tuning. The implemented phased array is capable of independent wideband frequency tuning and 2-D wide-angle beam steering. The circuit is fabricated in a 0.13-μm SiGe BiCMOS process and is measured to have 52-GHz/15.1% frequency tuning range from 318 to 370 GHz and 128°/53° 2-D beam-steering angle. The chip consumes 310-640 mW power from a 1.5-V supply with-6.8-dBm maximum radiated power and minimum-93.1-dBc/Hz phase noise at 10-MHz offset. To the best of our knowledge, this paper has the largest bandwidth among fully integrated THz radiator/phased arrays as well as the widest angle beam steering among fully integrated THz phased arrays.",

The bandwidth is extended using a varactor-less frequency tuning method, and EIRP is improved by increasing the size of the array using the proposed scalable coupling method and maximizing the radiation directivity using a silicon lens in an optimized radiation setup. An analysis of the radiation directivity of a chip-lens setup is presented as well as the employed approach for enhancing EIRP by maximizing the directivity.

Beta (beta)(1) integrin expression has been used as a way of enriching for putative epithelial stem cells through rapid adhesion to collagen IV or flow cytometry. This is a first report of enrichment of putative urothelial stem cells using rapid adhesion and flow cytometric methods. We assessed our success by determining the clonogenic and proliferative potential of the isolated cells. We demonstrated that enrichment based on beta(1) integrin expression with flow cytometry yields highly clonogenic and proliferative urothelial cells, whereas the rapid adhesion method is not as efficient, possibly because of the unique nature of urothelium, a transitional epithelium, compared to results reported in stratified and columnar epithelia.",

    "abstract": "Cape Espenberg is on the farthest southwestern extent of Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, just above the Arctic Circle, and is a peninsula composed of a series of dune-covered beach ridges. As part of a larger research initiative, extensive mapping to record all cultural features and characterize the topography of approximately 1 km2 on the southeastern terminus of the cape was undertaken in 2007 and 2010. The primary purpose of this mapping was to explore the use of the cape for the past 1,200 years using one of the unique aspects of beach-ridge archaeology: horizontal stratigraphy. There were 11 intervals of beach ridge/dune development, and with the exception of one truncated ridge and the modern ridge, Thule-lhupiaq people built semi-subterranean winter houses on each ridge. A total of 117 house depressions along with related cache pits, artifact scatters, whale bone, and hearths were identified; distribution of house forms indicate that Cape Espenberg has had an unbroken stream of cultural continuity. However, in terms of house architecture and community patterning, it appears that there has been a reduction of certain architectural components over time. Houses also occur more frequently in isolated contexts. Both aspects are coincident with the onset of the Little Ice Age. Copyright © 2013 by the Society for American Archaeology.",

In contrast, the diamines failed to affect AMPA and kainate currents. The inhibition of NMDA currents was highly voltage-dependent and was substantially relieved at positive holding potentials. In outside-out patches, DA10 and DA12 produced a voltage-dependent flickery block of NMDA-activated single-channel currents. These results indicate that DA10 and DA12 antagonize NMDA responses via an open channel mechanism. DA10 and DA12 have been proposed to be inverse agonists at the spermine facilitatory site on the NMDA receptor.

    "abstract": "Six different 1,2-epoxycycloalkanes, whose rings were constituted of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, were tested as possible inhibitors of epoxide-metabolizing enzymes and substrates for the microsomal and cytosolic epoxide hydrolases (mEH, cEH) in mouse liver. The geometric configurations and the relative steric hindrances of these epoxides were estimated from their ease of hydrolysis in acidic conditions to the corresponding diols, their abilities to react with nitrobenzylpyridine, and the chemical shifts of the groups associated with the oxirane rings measured by proton and 13C-NMR. The cyclopentene, -hexene, -heptene, -octene and -decene oxides adopted mainly a cis-configuration. By contrast, cyclododecene oxide presented a trans-configuration. Steric hindrance increased with the size of the ring and was particularly strong when cyclooctene, -decene and -dodecene oxides were considered. With the exception of cyclohexene oxide, all the compounds were weak inhibitors of EH and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. Cyclohexene oxide exhibited a selective inhibition of the mEH with an I50 of 4.0.10(-6) M. As the size of the ring increased, inhibitory potency was gradually lost. The cEH and the GST activities were less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of these epoxides (I50, 1 mM or above). A marked difference between the substrate selectivities of mEH and cEH for these epoxides was observed. The mEH hydrated all of the cyclic epoxides, although some of them at a very low rate; the best substrate was the cycloheptene oxide (2.3 nmol/min/mg protein).

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The molecular mechanism responsible for the immunomodulatory effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Vit-D) is still not well elucidated. Unavoidable systemic toxicity of Vit-D has encouraged to develop more potent and less toxic Vit-D analogs, such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-3-bromoacetate (BE). Our aim was to explore the immunosuppressive effect of BE and its molecular mechanism in autoimmune diseases. METHOD: Magnetically sorted CD3(+) T cells (T cells) from PBMCs of psoriasis and autoimmune arthritis patients were cultured with/without BE and Vit-D followed by proliferation (MTT, CFSE dilution assays) and apoptosis assays (annexin V). Immunoblot was performed to determine the signaling cascade responsible for the antiproliferative effect. RESULTS: In MTT assay, BE (OD: 0.64±0.08) markedly inhibited the anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated proliferation of T cells (OD: 1.8±0.30, p<0.001) and at equivalent doses, the inhibitory effect was more than that of Vit-D (OD: 0.91±0.11, p<0.05). The antiproliferative effect of BE was extended to activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) memory T cells (CD45RA(-)CD11a(+)) without much effect on the naïve T cells. BE induced more apoptosis of T cells (45.01±4.27%, p<0.01) compared to untreated cells (3.45±1.8%), and the proapoptotic effect was markedly more than that of Vit-D (26.1±2.05%, p<0.05). BE effectively inhibited the anti-CD3/CD28-induced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and in both, BE showed more potency than Vit-D (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Topical Vit-D is being used successfully in psoriasis for years. However, its potency is less compared to topical corticosteroids. The de novo BE showed significantly more immunosuppression than conventional Vit-D and the immunosuppressive effect is PI3K/Akt/mTOR dependent. Our results indicate that BE could be an effective therapeutic agent for psoriasis and other T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Previous work demonstrated that the mitochondrial fraction of rat seminiferous tubules is capable of metabolizing 1,3-dinitrobenzene, using NADPH as a cofactor. Moreover, 1,3-dinitrobenzene treatment of rat tubules caused a decrease in mitochondrial GSH levels. In situ mitochondrial metabolism of 1,3-dinitrobenzene may have caused this depletion through the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, generating oxidative stress and/or one or more metabolites of 1,3-dinitrobenzene which reacted nonenzymatically with GSH. The goal of this study is to investigate which of these two potential mechanisms may have caused the observed GSH depletion. Liver microsomes, known to rapidly metabolize 1,3-dinitrobenzene, generated the superoxide anion radical when incubated with 1,3-dinitrobenzene and NADPH. However, with the seminiferous tubule mitochondria, no oxygen radicals were detected. Hence, the aforementioned GSH depletion is unlikely due to the production of reactive oxygen intermediates from in situ mitochondrial metabolism of 1,3-dinitrobenzene. To investigate the ability of 1,3-dinitrobenzene metabolites to deplete seminiferous tubule mitochondrial GSH, mitochondria were incubated with 1,3-dinitrobenzene and NADPH. Loss of GSH correlated with the appearance of the 1,3-dinitrobenzene metabolites, nitrophenylhydroxylamine and nitroaniline. Subsequent investigation demonstrated that the metabolites, nitrosonitrobenzene, known to react nonenzymatically with nonprotein sulfhydryls, and nitrophenylhydroxylamine both oxidized seminiferous tubule mitochondrial GSH. Further studies suggested that nitrophenylhydroxylamine could deplete GSH via a free radical mechanism. In aqueous solution, this metabolite was shown to exist in equilibrium with a radical form, thought to be the hydronitroxide radical. The addition of GSH eliminated the signal, implying that the radical reacted nonenzymatically with GSH. In conclusion, the data in this study suggest that the decrease in mitochondrial GSH observed in DNB-treated seminiferous tubules is due to the formation of NPHA and NNB and not reactive oxygen intermediates.",

However, their relatively low metabolic stability leads to poor pharmacokinetic properties. To improve their bioavailability, we investigated the effect of incorporating various polar groups on the ether function on the inhibition potencies, physical properties, in vitro metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetic properties. The structure-activity relationship studies showed that a hydrophobic linker between the urea group and the ether function is necessary to keep their potency. In addition, urea-ether inhibitors having a polar group such as diethylene glycol or morpholine significantly improved their physical properties and metabolic stability without any loss of inhibitory potency. Furthermore, improved pharmacokinetic properties in murine and canine models were obtained with the resulting inhibitors. These findings will facilitate the usage of sEH inhibitors in animal models of hypertension and inflammation.",

The aim of this study was to identify oleaginous yeasts that are tolerant of the IL [C2C1Im][OAc] and [C2C1Im]Cl using 45 strains belonging to 38 taxonomically diverse species within phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Yeasts were cultivated in laboratory medium supplemented with 0, 2, or 4% IL in 96-well plates. The eight most tolerant strains were then cultivated in 10-mL media with no IL, 242mM [C2C1Im][OAc], or 242mM [C2C1Im]Cl. The effects of [C2C1Im]+ exposure on cell mass production and lipid accumulation varied at the species and strain level. The acetate salt decreased cell biomass and lipid production more severely than did the chloride ion for six strains. Lipid output was not markedly different (2.1 vs. 2.3 g/L) in Yarrowia lipolytica UCDFST 51-30, but decreased from 5 to 65% in other yeasts. An equimolar concentration of the chloride salt resulted in much milder effects, from 25% decrease to 66% increase in lipid output. The highest lipid outputs in this media were 8.3 and 7.9 g/L produced by Vanrija humicola UCDFST 10-1004 and UCDFST 12-717, respectively. These results demonstrated substantial lipid production in the presence of [C2C1Im]Cl at concentrations found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, and thus, these two strains are ideal candidates for further investigation.",

In addition, the profiles of phenolics as well as the changing patterns of individual phenolics also differed between the peel and the flesh. After long-time storage (180 d), the greatest decrease of concentrations was the concentrations of hyperoside (27 %) in the peel and total phenolics (35.0 %) in the flesh. Also, during the 90–180 d storage period, hyperoside and rutin in the peel, chlorogenic acid in the flesh, and flavonoids and antioxidant activity decreased in both peel and flesh tissues. Individual phenolics exhibited different stabilities during the early stages after harvest. 1-MCP reduced the reduction in the concentrations of hyperoside in the peel, chlorogenic acid in the flesh, and total phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant activity in both the peel and flesh tissues during storage and shelf life. However, for quercetin and rutin, the protective effect of 1-MCP was only observed during the shelf life period. Overall, phenolic compounds responded variously to storage, shelf life, shelf temperature and 1-MCP treatment.",

In this study, red gastrocnemius muscle, the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the liver left lobe were used to investigate the impact of a 1-month KD on mitochondrial content in healthy middle-aged mice. The results showed that in red gastrocnemius muscle, the fractional area of both subsarcolemmal (SSM) and intermyofibrillar (IMM) mitochondria was increased, and this was driven by an increase in the number of mitochondria. Mitochondrial fractional area or number was not altered in the liver, prefrontal cortex, or hippocampus following 1 month of a KD. These results demonstrate tissue-specific changes in mitochondrial mass with a short-term KD and highlight the need to study different muscle groups or tissue regions with TEM to thoroughly determine the effects of a KD on mitochondrial mass.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery in the early 1980s that 1-octen-3-ol, isolated from oxen breath, attracts tsetse fly, there has been growing interest in exploring the use of this semiochemical as a possible generic lure for trapping host-seeking mosquitoes. Intriguingly, traps baited with 1-octen-3-ol captured significantly more females of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, than control traps, but failed to attract the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that this attractant is detected with enantioselective odorant receptors (ORs) expressed only in maxillary palps. On the basis of indoor behavioral assays it has even been suggested that 1-octen-3-ol might be a repellent to the southern house mosquito. Our approach was two-prong, i.e., to isolate 1-octen-3-ol-sensitive ORs expressed in maxillary palps and antennae of southern house female mosquito, and test the hypothesis that this semiochemical is a repellent. An OR with high transcript levels in maxillary palps, CquiOR118b, showed remarkable selectivity towards ( R)-1-octen-3-ol, whereas an OR expressed in antennae, CquiOR114b, showed higher preference for ( S)-1-octen-3-ol than its antipode. Repellency by a surface landing and feeding assay showed that not only racemic, but enantiopure ( R)- and ( S)-1-octen-3-ol are repellents at 1% dose thus suggesting the occurrence of other ( S)-1-octen-3-ol-sensitive OR(s). Female mosquitoes with ablated maxillary palps were repelled by 1-octen-3-ol, which implies that in addition to OR(s) in the maxillary palps, antennal OR(s) are essential for repellency activity.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups. Two groups served as control and received orally either vehicle or TPPU (3 mg/kg) for five weeks. The other three groups were given L-NAME (50 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for five weeks. Two weeks after the L-NAME treatment, animals received orally either saline or TPPU (3 mg/kg/day) or lisinopril (10 mg/kg/day) daily for 3 weeks. Blood pressure (BP) was measured weekly. At the end of the experiment, plasma Ang II, cardiac ACE and AT1R protein and gene expressions were determined. RESULTS: L-NAME caused a significant increase in BP of the animals. TPPU and lisinopril resulted in normalization of L-NAME-induced hypertension. They also caused a significant reduction in Ang II and ACE protein and gene expressions compared to L-NAME and vehicle-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that TPPU effectively lowers L-NAME-induced hypertension in rats. The mechanism of its antihypertensive effect is likely mediated by the suppression of ACE gene and protein expression, leading to a lower Ang II level.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Neuroinflammation is a prevalent pathogenic stress leading to neuronal death in AD. Targeting neuroinflammation to keep neurons alive is an attractive strategy for AD therapy. 1-Trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU) is a potent inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and can enter into the brain. It has good efficacy on a wide range of chronic inflammatory diseases in preclinical animal models. However, the anti-neuroinflammatory effects and molecular mechanisms of TPPU for potential AD interventions remain elusive. With an aim to develop multitarget therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, we screened TPPU against sEH from different mammalian species and a broad panel of human kinases in vitro for potential new targets relevant to neuroinflammation in AD. TPPU inhibits both human sEH and p38β kinase, two key regulators of inflammation, with nanomolar potencies and distinct selectivity. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms, differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were used as an AD cell model, and we investigated the neuroprotection of TPPU against amyloid oligomers. We found that TPPU effectively prevents neuronal death by mitigating amyloid neurotoxicity, tau hyperphosphorylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, promoting neurite outgrowth and suppressing activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB for inflammatory responses in human nerve cells. The results indicate that TPPU is a potent and selective dual inhibitor of sEH and p38β kinase, showing a synergistic action in multiple AD signaling pathways. Our study sheds light upon TPPU and other sEH/p38β dual inhibitors for potential pharmacological interventions in AD.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial luciferase is a flavin monooxygenase that catalyzes the oxidation of a long-chain aldehyde and releases energy in the form of visible light. A new crystal form of luciferase cloned from Vibrio harveyi has been grown under low-salt concentrations, which diffract x-rays beyond 1.5-A resolution. The x-ray structure of bacterial luciferase has been refined to a conventional R-factor of 18.2% for all recorded synchrotron data between 30.0 and 1.50-A resolution. Bacterial luciferase is an alpha-beta heterodimer, and the individual subunits fold into a single domain (beta/alpha)8 barrel. The high resolution structure reveals a non-prolyl cis peptide bond that forms between Ala74 and Ala75 in the alpha subunit near the putative active site. This cis peptide bond may have functional significance for creating a cavity at the active site. Bacterial luciferase employs reduced flavin as a substrate rather than a cofactor. The structure presented was determined in the absence of substrates. A comparison of the structural similarities between luciferase and a nonfluorescent flavoprotein, which is expressed in the lux operon of one genus of bioluminescent bacteria, suggests that the two proteins originated from a common ancestor. However, the flavin binding sites of the nonfluorescent protein are likely not representative of the flavin binding site on luciferase. The structure presented here will furnish a detailed molecular model for all bacterial luciferases.",

Emerging models have postulated that predictive mechanisms require synchronous firing of neural networks, but to date, this relationship has been investigated primarily through oscillatory activity in narrow frequency bands. A recently-developed measure proposed to reflect broadband neural activity - and thereby synchronous neuronal firing - is 1/f neural noise extracted from EEG spectral power. Previous research has indicated that this measure of 1/f neural noise changes across the lifespan, and these neural changes predict age-related behavioral impairments in visual working memory. Using a cross-sectional sample of young and older adults, we examined age-related changes in 1/f neural noise and whether this measure predicted ERP correlates of successful lexical prediction during discourse comprehension. 1/f neural noise across two different language tasks revealed high within-subject correlations, indicating that this measure can provide a reliable index of individualized patterns of neural activation. In addition to age, 1/f noise was a significant predictor of N400 effects of successful lexical prediction; however, noise did not mediate age-related declines in other ERP effects. We discuss broader implications of these findings for theories of predictive processing, as well as potential applications of 1/f noise across research populations.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To analyze Abulafia-Koch regression (AKRT), anterior and posterior astigmatism (K and TK), and evaluate biometry data in a large population. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: This multicenter (2 tertiary care centers) study analyzed datasets acquired between 2017 and 2020. Axial length (AL), corneal front and back radii (including meridians for K and TK conversion), horizontal corneal diameter, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and central corneal thickness were measured using telecentric keratometry and swept-source optical coherence tomography-based biometry (IOLMaster 700; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). Cooke-modified axial length (CMAL) and AKRT were calculated. Difference vectors between K and TK astigmatism and between AKRT and TK astigmatism were compared. RESULTS: A total of 10,300 eyes from 6388 patients were assessed. Difference vectors for K and TK were significantly smaller than for AKRT and TK. K measurement showed a configuration of 51.49% of with-the-rule astigmatism and 30.51% against-the-rule astigmatism, TK measurement showed a configuration of 41.60% of with-the-rule astigmatism and 40.21% against-the-rule astigmatism. Mean total astigmatism was -0.94 ± 0.74 dpt. Mean values for AL and CMAL were 23.70 ± 1.39 mm and 23.70 ± 1.34 mm, respectively. Anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, horizontal corneal diameter, AL, and age were all correlated with each other. CONCLUSION: Astigmatism analysis showed less difference between K and TK than between AKRT and TK. There were significantly fewer eyes with with-the-rule astigmatism and more eyes with against-the-rule astigmatism configuration in TK-derived than in K-derived keratometry. The study provides data on gender and generational differences in biometry. Significant intersexual differences in AL and CMAL were observed, with CMAL providing lower standard deviation compared with AL.",

    "abstract": "Estuarine systems are among the most impacted ecosystems due to anthropogenic contaminants; however, they present unique challenges to toxicity testing with regard to varying water quality parameters. The euryhaline amphipod species, Hyalella azteca, is widely used in toxicity testing and well suited for testing estuarine water samples. Nevertheless, the influence of relevant water quality parameters on test endpoints must be quantified in order to efficiently use this species for routine monitoring. Here, we studied the influence of five water quality parameters: electrical conductivity, pH, un-ionized ammonia, dissolved oxygen and temperature, on H. azteca survival in a water column toxicity test. A model was developed to quantify and predict the independent and interacting effects of water quality variables on 10-day survival. The model allows simultaneous assessment of multiple potential predictors recorded during the tests. Data used for modeling came from 1089 tests performed on ambient water samples over a period of three years (2006-2008). The final model reflects significant effects of predictors and their two-way interactions. The effect of each level of all predictors on survival probability of H. azteca was examined by comparing levels of each predictor at a time, while holding all others at their lowest (reference) level. This study showed that predictors of survival in water column tests should not be evaluated in isolation in the interpretation of H. azteca water column tests. Our model provides a useful tool to predict expected control survival based on relevant water quality parameters, and thus enables the use of H. azteca tests for toxicity monitoring in estuaries with a wide range of water quality conditions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary diversity scores and dichotomous indicators derived from them are widely used to assess dietary quality, and specific scoring methods have been recommended for women and 6- to 23-mo-old children. However, there is no specific score recommended for older children and the effect of seasonal dietary changes on score performance is not well documented. OBJECTIVE: We assessed performance of 2 recommended dietary diversity scores as indicators of dietary quality over 3 seasons. METHODS: We conducted 7 repeat 24-h dietary recalls among 4- to 8-y-old rural Zambian children (n = 200) over 6 mo. Dietary diversity was assessed using a 7-food group score for assessing infant and young child feeding (DDS-IYCF) and a 10-food group score for use among women of reproductive age (DDS-W). Micronutrient intake adequacy was described by mean probability of adequacy (MPA) over 11 micronutrients. Longitudinal models were fit to test the association between each score and MPA overall and by season. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to describe indicator performance of each score. RESULTS: Mean ± SE scores were 4.11 ± 0.03 for DDS-IYCF and 4.39 ± 0.03 for DDS-W. Both scores varied by season, but DDS-W better reflected seasonal dietary changes. Across seasons, MPA increased 1-6 percentage points/unit increase in DDS-IYCF or 1-10 percentage points for DDS-W (P < 0.05). Score performance as a predictor of MPA > 0.75 was moderate, with area under the ROC curve values by season ranging from 0.63 to 0.77 for DDS-IYCF and from 0.66 to 0.72 for DDS-W. CONCLUSIONS: DDS-W performed better than DDS-IYCF in characterizing seasonal variability and micronutrient adequacy among rural Zambian children.",

A fourth cultivar, 'Valley Forge', was added to the plot in 1999. American elms grown from seed were planted as controls. In the 10-year period from 1992 to 2002, tree height and trunk diameter were measured annually, and inspections for DED infections, elm leaf beetle activity, and other pests were conducted. In August 2003, one 'American Liberty' was found to be infected with DED. This is the only tree that has shown infection symptoms since the beginning of the study. Elm leaf beetle activity was highest in 1993 and 1994, causing substantial injury to 'American Liberty', 'Frontier', and controls. 'Prospector' sustained little injury. Other pest activity has been slight in most years. In 2002, 'Frontier', 'American Liberty', and controls were found to have equivalent trunk diameter growth, and all were significantly larger than 'Prospector'. After 10 years, 'Frontier' was tallest [11.3 m (37 ft)], 'Prospector' was shortest [6.9 m (23 ft)], and 'American Liberty' and controls were in between [9.6 and 10.3 m (32 and 34 ft), respectively]. 'Valley Forge' was monitored for 3 years and then removed from the study because of poor structure.",

This has led to its recent inclusion into the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for management of cutaneous melanoma metastases. Despite this, intralesional IL-2 has not been highlighted in the US literature nor have US physicians adopted it. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of intralesional IL-2 combined with topical imiquimod and retinoid for treatment of cutaneous metastatic melanoma. METHODS: A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cutaneous metastatic melanoma were treated with intralesional IL-2 combined with topical imiquimod and retinoid. RESULTS: A 100% complete local response rate with long-term follow-up (average of 24 months) was seen in all 11 patients treated with this proposed regimen. Biopsy specimens of treated sites confirmed absence of malignant cells. The most common treatment-related adverse event was rigors. LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients, retrospective review of charts, and lack of a comparison group were limitations. CONCLUSION: Intralesional IL-2 administered concomitantly with topical imiquimod and a retinoid cream is a promising therapeutic option for managing cutaneous melanoma metastases. The regimen was well tolerated and should be considered as a reasonable alternative to surgical excision.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a baseline residual encoder for H.264/AVC on a programmable fine-grained many-core processing array that utilizes no application-specific hardware. The software encoder contains integer transform, quantization, and context-based adaptive variable length coding functions. By exploiting fine-grained data and task-level parallelism, the residual encoder is partitioned and mapped to an array of 25 small processors. The proposed encoder encodes video sequences with variable frame sizes and can encode 1080p high-definition television at 30 f/s with 293 mW average power consumption by adjusting each processor to workload-based optimal clock frequencies and dual supply voltagesa 38.4% power reduction compared to operation with only one clock frequency and supply voltage. In comparison to published implementations on the TI C642 digital signal processing platform, the design has approximately 2.9-3.7 times higher scaled throughput, 11.2-15.0 times higher throughput per chip area, and 4.5-5.8 times lower energy per pixel. Compared to a heterogeneous single instruction, multiple data architecture customized for H.264, the presented design has 2.8-3.6 times greater throughput, 4.5-5.9 times higher area efficiency, and similar energy efficiency. The proposed fine-grained parallelization methodology provides a new approach to program a large number of simple processors allowing for a higher level of parallelization and energy-efficiency for video encoding than conventional processors while avoiding the cost and design time of implementing an application specific integrated circuit or other application-specific hardware. © 2011 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Much progress has been made in recent years into understanding molecular mechanisms by which transcription is regulated following changes in physiological stimuli. This review has tried to focus on what is known about four specific physiological challenges--mechanical load, intracellular calcium, hypoxia, and redox state. Because of our biased interest in exercise, it was our goal to review these relatively well-studied systems so that we might provide insight into potential mechanisms that govern exercise-induced transcriptional changes. What becomes obvious, when reaching the end of this review, is that there are many common themes among the different physiological responses described. Some examples include the activation of IEGs, such as c-jun and c-fos, the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, and the importance of the serum response element and the serum response factor. These commonalities across the different physiological systems suggest a certain redundancy or shared mechanism(s) for regulating transcription in response to physiological stimuli. While very little is known at this time about how exercise regulates transcription, it is an exciting time in this field of research. The recent growth in the molecular biological research literature of more physiologically-based studies provides exciting new molecular and cellular tools for those researchers willing to take on the challenge of understanding the complex mechanisms of exercise-induced adaptations.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Endothelial dysfunction, including upregulation of inflammatory adhesion molecules and impaired vasodilatation, is a key element in cardiovascular disease. Aging and estrogen withdrawal in women are associated with endothelial inflammation, vascular stiffness and increased cardiovascular disease. Epoxyecosatrienoic acids (EETs), the products of arachidonic acid metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2J, 2C and other isoforms, are regulated by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-catalyzed conversion into less active diols. We hypothesized that 11,12-EETs would reduce the endothelial dysfunction associated with aging and estrogen loss. APPROACH/RESULTS: When stabilized by an sEH inhibitor (seHi), 11,12-EET at a physiologically low dose (0.1nM) reduced cytokine-stimulated upregulation of adhesion molecules on human aorta endothelial cells (HAEC) and monocyte adhesion under shear flow through marked depolarization of the HAEC when combined with TNFα. Mechanistically, neither 11,12-EETs nor 17β-estradiol (E2) at physiologic concentrations prevented activation of NFκB by TNFα. E2 at physiological concentrations reduced sEH expression in HAEC, but did not alter CYP expression, and when combined with TNFα depolarized the cell. We also examined vascular dysfunction in adult and aged ovariectomized Norway brown rats (with and without E2 replacement) using an ex-vivo model to analyze endothelial function in an intact segment of artery. sEHi and 11,12-EET with or without E2 attenuated phenylephrine induced constriction and increased endothelial-dependent dilation of aortic rings from ovariectomized rats. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing 11,12-EETs through sEH inhibition effectively attenuates inflammation and may provide an effective strategy to preserve endothelial function and prevent atherosclerotic heart disease in postmenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "Venlafaxine is commonly used in the United States for approved and non-Food and Drug Administration-approved indications in adults. It is used off-label to treat children for psychiatric diagnoses. The aim of the study was to describe venlafaxine toxicities in children and to identify the venlafaxine dose per weight that correlates with toxicities. An 11-year retrospective study of venlafaxine ingestion in children was performed using the California Poison Control System (CPCS) database. Data was extracted from phone calls received by CPCS clinicians and follow-up phone calls made to assess the patient's progress in a health-care setting. Inclusion criteria were venlafaxine ingestion cases reported to CPCS between January 2001 and December 2011, children aged 20 years and under, venlafaxine as the only ingested substance, managed in a health-care facility, and followed to a known outcome. Two hundred sixty-two cases met the study criteria. Common presentations included gastrointestinal (14.9%), altered mental status (13.7%), and tachycardia (13.4%). The majority of the cases resulted in no effect (51.5%) or minor effect (19.9%). The average estimated dose per weight was 18.3 mg/kg in all patients and 64.5 mg/kg in those experiencing moderate-to-severe adverse effects. Seizures occurred in only 4 of the 262 cases at doses ranging from 1500 to 7500 mg. Although the estimated dose per weight exceeded 10 mg/kg for the majority of the cases, only 12 cases resulted in moderate or severe outcomes. The majority of venlafaxine ingestion cases in children resulted in either no clinical effects or minor clinical effects.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seizures of both immediate and delayed onset after ingestion of bupropion SR and bupropion XL formulations are well documented, but are less well characterized after insufflation. Bupropion is crushed and insufflated to experience a high similar to that from amphetamines and cocaine. We sought to characterize the abuse of bupropion via insufflation in cases reported to the California Poison Control System (CPCS) and the incidence of seizures. METHODS: An 11-year (2002-2012) retrospective observational case series of insufflated bupropion exposures evaluated in a health care facility (HCF) were reviewed after searching our database for all bupropion insufflation exposures. Patients with coingestants, multiple exposure routes, or age less than 18 were excluded. Data included age, gender, estimated bupropion dose, occurrence of pre-HCF seizures, symptoms and vital signs reported to the CPCS, treatments, and adverse events that occurred until time of discharge. RESULTS: 74 cases were identified (1 excluded due to age, 5 excluded due to additional oral ingestion of bupropion, and 1 excluded due to being unable to follow). A total of 67 cases met inclusion criteria. The median age was 36 (range, 18-65) years. The total dose of bupropion insufflated was reported in 52 pts; median dose of 1500 (range, 100-9000) mg. Eighteen cases (27%) involved staggered or chronic exposures. Of the 67 patients, 20 (30%) experienced a seizure prior to arrival at the HCF. Of these, 19 patients (95%) presented with tachycardia. None of these patients had a second seizure in the emergency department. There were no major medical outcomes and no deaths. Of the 67 patients, 9 patients received benzodiazepines and 6 patients received single-dose activated charcoal. CONCLUSION: The abuse of bupropion by crushing and insufflating through the nose is uncommon (67/2270 or 3.0%) compared with that by oral bupropion exposures reported to CPCS. Seizures are common but are self-limited. Delayed seizures (more than 8 h after exposure) appear to be rare. Tachycardia is present in almost all patients who have seizures.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Levetiracetam is a new anticonvulsant, which works to block high-voltage-activated Ca(++) channels in children, for partial-onset seizures. Reports of clinical experience with pediatric ingestions are minimal. The purpose of this study was to characterize the toxicity of accidental levetiracetam exposures in children less than 6 years of age. METHODS: This was an 11-year retrospective observational case series of pediatric (< 6 years old) levetiracetam ingestions reported to a Poison Control System from 2002 to 2013. Case narratives were individually reviewed to collect desired information on exposure and clinical course. Inclusion criteria were levetiracetam as a single ingested medication, age less than 6 years, treatment in a health care facility, and followed to a known outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-two cases met inclusion criteria with 55% female patients and overall median age of 2.0 years (range: 1-60 months). The levetiracetam dose ingested was reported in 69 (84.1%) cases, with exact dose (median dose, 45.0 mg/kg; range, 10.5-1429 mg/kg) reported in 33 cases (40.2%). Of these, twenty-nine cases (88%) involved the oral solution formulation and 28 cases (85%) had unintentional therapeutic error as the cause of the exposure. No dose-response relationship was demonstrated; however, the odds of a levetiracetam-naive patient, (median dose, 26.9 mg/kg; N = 15) with an unintentional exposure, developing drowsiness or ataxia was 6 times that of a patient who was not naïve to levetiracetam (median dose, 70.1 mg/kg; N = 20) (Odds ratio [OR], 6.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-35.91).Of the 82 cases, 17 (20.7%) developed untoward clinical effects of drowsiness and/or ataxia. Eighty patients (97.6%) were treated and discharged from the emergency department, and two patients (2.4%) were admitted. The two patients admitted included a two-month old who was accidentally given a dose 10 times that of her usual dose and a 3-year old who was lethargic on arrival to the hospital after ingestion of an unknown dose. Of all patients, 66 patients (80.5%) had no effect from the drug exposure. The medical outcome was considered to be minor in 15 cases (18.3%), and moderate in 1 case (1.2%). There were no cases with major outcomes and no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric levetiracetam exposures were associated with few transient clinical effects. Poison Control Centers may wish to consider acuity of ingestion when developing send-in protocols.",

Two classes of processes underlie control. Strategic processes provide top-down support for task operations; evaluative processes monitor ongoing performance. Using event-related fMRI and a task-switching Stroop paradigm we examined whether the strategic/evaluative distinction could be used to dissociate DLPFC and ACC. LDLPFC showed cue-related activity which was greater for color naming than word reading, with greater activation correlating with smaller Stroop effects (r = -.63). ACC showed only response-related activity which was greater for incongruent color-naming trials and correlated positively with the RT Stroop effect (r = .41). These data suggest DLPFC contributes a strategic function and ACC an evaluative one to executive control. © 2001 Academic Press.",

To better determine whether this ligand holds promise for imaging and therapy in lymphoid malignancies, 6 LLP2A derivatives, as LLP2A-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (LLP2A-DOTA) and LLP2A-DOTA-polyethylene glycol (LLP2A-DOTA-PEG), were designed, synthesized, and radiolabeled with (111)In. Comparative pharmacokinetic studies in mice with Raji B-cell lymphoma xenografts were then complemented by small-animal PET of the lead molecular LLP2A format using (64)Cu-LLP2A-11-bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane ((64)Cu-LLP2A-CB-TE2A). METHODS: LLP2A-DOTA and LLP2A-CB-TE2A were prepared using solid-phase synthesis; LLP2A-DOTA-PEG(2,000), LLP2A-DOTA-PEG(5,000), LLP2A-DOTA-PEG(10,000), (LLP2A-DOTA)(2)PEG(10,000), and (LLP2A-DOTA)(4)PEG(10,000) were prepared by PEGylation. (111)In radiolabeling of DOTA and (64)Cu radiolabeling of CB-TE2A conjugates yielded 370-1,850 and 3,700-7,400 kBq/microg (10-50 and 100-200 microCi/microg), respectively. The pharmacokinetics of the six (111)In radioconjugates were studied in vivo using biodistribution data (4 and 24 h) and whole-body autoradiography (24 h) in mice with Raji tumor xenografts. (64)Cu-LLP2A-CB-TE2A was imaged (4 and 24 h) on a small-animal PET scanner in the same mouse model. RESULTS: The highest tumor uptake in pharmacokinetic studies was obtained with LLP2A-DOTA and (LLP2A-DOTA)(4)-PEG(10,000). For (111)In-LLP2A-DOTA (1 nM) at 4 and 24 h after injection, ratios of tumor to blood and tumor to nontumor (normal) organ (T/NT) were 8 to 35:1 for all organs or tissue except the spleen, marrow, and kidney, which were between 2:1 and 1:1. Tetravalent (LLP2A-DOTA)(4)-PEG(10,000) (1.1 nM) had tumor uptake similar to the univalent LLP2A-DOTA but higher liver, marrow, and kidney uptake. The excellent T/NT of LLP2A was also demonstrated by small-animal PET with (64)Cu-LLP2A-CB-TE2A at both 4 and 24 h after injection; obvious spleen targeting was apparent, but little kidney or liver activity was observed. CONCLUSION: Of the conjugates investigated, the univalent, non-PEGylated ligand (111)In-LLP2A-DOTA exhibited the best T/NT ratios and showed the greatest potential for imaging of alpha4beta1 in human lymphoma. Furthermore, this univalent non-PEGylated LLP2A format, as (64)Cu-LLP2A-CB-TE2A, demonstrated excellent tumor targeting by small-animal PET and warrants further investigation as an agent for the study of alpha4beta1 expression in human lymphoid malignancies.",

One problem with silicone gel sheets application is that the sheets lose their adhesive qualities making them difficult to affix to the patient and costly to replace when lost. A new ultra-thin, clear and adhesive silicone gel sheet layered on a semi-permeable polyester backing was trialed at our burn center. The silicone is designed to be a one-time application, worn during all activities until it naturally falls off, thus eliminating the need for daily removal and cleaning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the single-use adhesive silicone sheets with pediatric burn survivors.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Medical records of pediatric burn survivors who used the adherent silicone sheets between September 2019 and July 2020 were retrospectively reviewed.

The average age of the patients was 7.4 (±8.5) years and TBSA 53 ±17%. The time from injury or grafting to when the silicone was applied was 200.5 (±13.4) days. The silicone was worn without interruption for an average of 12.8 days. Total Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) scores for both the patient and observer evaluations significantly improved after use with the single-use adherent silicone (↓13.83 patient p=.005, ↓5.4 observer p=.01). Evaluating individual scar parameters showed 4/7 patient reported and observed areas of the POSAS evaluation improved significantly with adherent silicone use (Figure 1). Only one patient reported a complication of itch at day 5 and the silicone was removed.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The single-use adhesive silicone investigated in this study appears to adequately adhere to patients over multiple days, thus overcoming common barriers to silicone use of the products falling off, getting lost and needing to be replaced.

The relaxation time scale of the BO4/BO3 ratio is found to be closely comparable with those of the bulk properties, namely, refractive index and viscosity, showing a close connection with one another. Samples partially equilibrated at a low temperature, when subjected to a positive temperature jump, display an initial rapid decrease followed by an increase in the BO4/BO3 ratio. This reversal in the trend of the variation of the BO4/BO3 ratio has been interpreted to be the signature of a memory effect, and the implications are discussed within the framework of the potential energy landscape model of glassy dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Constitutional and somatic chromosomal abnormalities of the chromosome 11p15 region are involved in an overgrowth malformation syndrome, the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), and in several types of associated tumors. The bias in parental origin for the different etiologic forms of this syndrome and for loss of heterozygosity in the tumors suggests that a gene (or genes) mapping to this region undergoes genomic imprinting. However, the precise localization of the locus (or loci) for the BWS and associated tumors is still unknown and more markers are required. We therefore isolated 11p15 markers from two libraries: the first one obtained by microdissection of the chromosome 11p15.5 region and the second one, a phage library, constructed from a hybrid cell line containing this region as its sole human DNA. Of 19 microclones isolated from the microdissection library, 11 were evolutionarily conserved. Four phage clones were isolated; one (D11S774) detected a highly informative variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and another (D11S773) a biallelic polymorphism. These clones were sublocalized using a panel of somatic cell hybrids that defines eight physical intervals in 11p15.5. Twenty-one clones map to the distal interval that harbors the BWS locus.",

A preliminary analysis of our data of 31 of 44 patients who underwent neck dissections from a prospective study showed numerous findings of shoulder disability that are not attributable to accessory nerve palsy but are well described by the syndrome of adhesive capsulitis of the glenohumeral joint. At 1 month postoperatively, although accessory nerve palsy symptoms were common, adhesive capsulitis symptoms were significant. At 6 months, the frequency of accessory nerve palsy symptoms was less as the accessory nerve had begun to recover. At 12 and 18 months, when most of the accessory nerves had recovered, the accessory nerve palsy symptoms were comparatively uncommon while the adhesive capsulitis symptoms predominated as the remaining symptoms of the 11th nerve syndrome. We propose that adhesive capsulitis is a principal component of the 11th nerve syndrome that can significantly compound the morbidity of a neck dissection even when the accessory nerve recovers. We also propose that adhesive capsulitis accounts for the persistence and variability of shoulder symptoms after neck dissection that cannot be attributed to trapezius muscle dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Steroid 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1; EC 1.14.15.4) is a mitochondrial enzyme located in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex and also in the brain that mediates the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) to corticosterone. Inhibitors of CYP11B1, such as metyrapone and etomidate, reduce glucocorticoid synthesis and raise levels of DOC providing greater availability for metabolic conversion to the GABA(A) receptor modulating neurosteroid allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC). Because THDOC is a potent anticonvulsant, it is plausible that CYP11B1 inhibitors could protect against seizures. Here we demonstrate that metyrapone affords dose-dependent protection against 6-Hz seizures 30 min after injection (ED(50), 191 mg/kg), but is markedly more potent at 6 h (ED(50), 30 mg/kg). Similarly, etomidate is also protective at 30 min and 6 h (ED(50) values, 4.5 and 1.7 mg/kg). Finasteride, an inhibitor of neurosteroid synthesis, attenuated the anticonvulsant effects of both CYP11B1 inhibitors at 6 h, but not 30 min following their injection. Plasma THDOC levels measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were markedly increased 6 h after injection of both CYP11B1 inhibitors and this increase was attenuated by finasteride pretreatment. We conclude that inhibition of CYP11B1 causes delayed seizure protection due to slow build-up of neurosteroids. Early seizure protection is independent of neurosteroids.",

    "abstract": "Lipoxygenase (ALOX) enzymes are implicated in both pro- and anti-atherogenic processes. The aim of this study was to investigate mRNA expression of 12- and 15-lipoxygenases (ALOX12, ALOX12B, ALOX15, ALOX15B) and the atypical ALOXE3 in human carotid atherosclerotic lesions, in relation to cerebrovascular symptoms and risk factors. The Biobank of Karolinska Endarterectomies (BiKE) collection of human carotid plaque tissue and associated clinical data was utilized (n=132). Lesion mRNA levels were analyzed by TaqMan qPCR (n=132) and microarray hybridization (n=77). Of the investigated mRNAs, only ALOX15B (15-LOX-2; epidermis-type 15-LOX) was readily detected in all plaque samples by qPCR, and thus suitable for quantitative statistical evaluation. ALOX12, ALOX12B, ALOX15 and ALOXE3 were detected with lower frequency and at lower levels, or virtually undetected. Microarray analysis confirmed ALOX15B as the most abundant 12- or 15-lipoxygenase mRNA in carotid lesions. Comparing plaques with or without attributable cerebrovascular symptoms (amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, or stroke), ALOX15B mRNA levels were higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic plaques (1.31 [1.11-1.56], n=102; and 0.79 [0.55-1.15], n=30, respectively; p=0.008; mean [95% CI], arbitrary units). Multiple regression analysis confirmed symptomatic/asymptomatic status as a significant determinant of ALOX15B mRNA levels, independently of potentially confounding factors. Immunohistochemical analyses showed abundant ALOX15B expression in macrophage-rich areas of carotid lesions, and lipidomic analyses demonstrated the presence of typical ALOX15B products in plaque tissue. In summary, we observed associations between high ALOX15B expression in carotid lesions and a history of cerebrovascular symptoms. These findings suggest a link between ALOX15B and atherothrombotic events that merits further investigation.",

To assess the requirements for papilloma formation and malignant conversion and determine the sensitivity to a chemical promotion stimulus, HK1.fos mice were promoted with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). HK1.fos mice were sensitive to TPA promotion but developed papillomas only after long latency (20-30 weeks of promotion) and in relatively few numbers per animal, suggesting the necessity of an additional genetic event prior to overt lesion formation. Consistent with this idea, at 60 weeks, on cessation of TPA promotion, these HK1.fos TPA-papillomas were found to be autonomous, TPA-independent tumors which persisted, grew larger, and converted to malignancy. Analysis of HK1.fos tumor RNA and DNA identified endogenous c-rasHa mutations at codons 12 and 61 in papillomas and carcinomas; however, no p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations were detected. These data indicate that epidermal expression of v-fos induces sensitivity to TPA promotion, but since additional genetic events, such as endogenous c-rasHa activation, appear to be required in tumorigenesis, v-fos may predominantly play a role in the mechanism of promotion to achieve papilloma autonomy and TPA independence. Furthermore, spontaneous malignant conversion in this model does not appear to involve mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene.",

HK1.fos/α mice exhibited aberrant epidermal proliferation and differentiation and formed spontaneous papillomas that achieved tumor autonomy but did not convert to malignancy. To determine the sensitivity to a chemical promotion stimulus, HK1.fos/α mice were promoted with 12-O- tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Previously, after 7 mo TPA promotion of HK1.TGFα mice that express moderate levels of TGFα elicited papillomas that remained regression-prone and benign for up to 2 yr. In HK1.fos mice, 6 mo TPA elicited papillomas that required spontaneous c-Ha-ras activation and converted to malignancy after 14-16mo. We now show that in HK1.fos/α transgenic genotypes, TPA promotion accelerated papillomatogenesis, with the earliest papilloma appearance at 2 mo after initiation of TPA promotion. These papillomas started to convert to malignancy by 10 mo. Analysis of HK1.fos/α papillomas and carcinomas revealed that the endogenous c-Ha-ras gene possessed mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 at the papilloma stage, but no mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene were detected. These data indicate that coexpression of fos and TGFα increased epidermal sensitivity to TPA promotion, which accelerated malignant conversion. However, in this transgenic model conversion always required additional genetic events, e.g., activation of the endogenous c-Ha-ras gene.",

DESIGN: A prospective 12-year inception cohort study ending December 31, 2003. SETTING: Regional academic level I trauma center. PATIENTS: One thousand three hundred forty-four trauma patients at risk for postinjury MOF. Inclusion criteria were aged older than 15 years, admission to the trauma intensive care unit, an Injury Severity Score higher than 15, and survival for more than 48 hours after injury. Isolated head injuries were excluded from this study. Previously identified risk factors for postinjury MOF were age, Injury Severity Score, and receiving a blood transfusion within 12 hours of injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multiple organ failure was defined by a Denver MOF score of 4 or more for longer than 48 hours after injury. Multiple organ failure severity was defined by the maximum daily MOF score and the number of MOF free days within the first 28 postinjury days. RESULTS: Multiple organ failure was diagnosed in 339 (25%) of 1244 patients. The mean age and Injury Severity Scores increased and the use of blood transfusion during resuscitation decreased over the 12-year study period. After adjusting for age, injury severity, and amount of blood transfused during resuscitation, there was a decreased incidence of MOF over the study period. Of the patients who developed MOF, there was a decrease in disease severity and duration as measured by the maximum daily MOF score and the MOF free days. Although the overall mortality rate remained constant, the MOF-specific mortality decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, severity, and attendant mortality of postinjury MOF decreased over the last 12 years despite an increased MOF risk. Improvements in MOF outcomes can be attributed to improvements in trauma and critical care and are associated with decreased use of blood transfusion during resuscitation.",

A Phase 3 open-label, single-arm study of oral ibrexafungerp (FURI) (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03059992) is ongoing for the treatment of patients (≥18 years) with fungal diseases who are intolerant of or refractory to standard antifungal therapies.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>An independent Data Review Committee (DRC) provided an assessment of treatment response for 41 patients. Patients were enrolled in 22 centers from 6 countries. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had proven or probable, invasive or severe mucocutaneous candidiasis and documented evidence of failure of, intolerance to, or toxicity related to a currently approved standard-of-care antifungal treatment or could not receive approved oral antifungal options (e.g., susceptibility of the organism) and a continued IV antifungal therapy was undesirable or unfeasible.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The 41 patients assessed had the following infection types: intra-abdominal abscesses, oropharyngeal candidiasis, esophageal candidiasis, candidemia, and others. The DRC adjudicated 23 patients (56%) as achieving complete or partial response, 11 patients (27%) maintaining stable disease, 6 patients (15%) with progression of disease and one case was considered as indeterminate. The efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp by pathogen is shown in Table 1. Ibrexafungerp was well-tolerated with the most common treatment-related adverse events being of gastrointestinal origin. No deaths due to progression of fungal disease were reported.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Table 1: Ibrexafungerp Outcomes by Pathogen</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p />\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Preliminary analysis of these 41 cases indicate that oral ibrexafungerp provides a favorable therapeutic response in the majority of patients with difficult to treat Candida spp. infections, including those caused by non-albicans Candida species.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Barbara D.

While overlap among MA and opioid abuse has risen, studies examining the impact of MA abuse and socioeconomic status on opioid requirements in burn injured patients remain limited.

Demographics, burn size (TBSA), admission toxicity screening, discharge pain scores, length of stay (LOS), adjuvant pain medications, and opioid equivalents (OE) within 24 hours of discharge were reviewed. OEs were determined by conversion of narcotics to oral morphine equivalents.

MNEG patients had significantly higher OE (p=0.03) requirements than MPOS patients. No significant differences were noted between gender (p=0.22), TBSA (p=0.70), benzodiazepine use (p=0.87), or clonidine use (p = 0.88) between groups. MPOS patients were less likely to receive gabapentin (p=0.03). OE and OE/TBSA requirements correlated with discharge pain score (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and LOS (p &amp;lt; 0.001). A significantly higher level of poverty was seen in MPOS patients (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but poverty itself was not a predictor of OE (p = 0.66), OE/TBSA (p = 0.90), pain score (p = 0.28), or LOS (0.49). Multivariate linear regression found MNEG status (p=0.003), TBSA (p&amp;lt; 0.0001), and pain score (p&amp;lt; 0.0001) were independently associated with OE.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Though lower socioeconomic status was seen more in patients with MA abuse, it was not associated with opioid use or pain scores.

    "abstract": "The 12th International Workshops on Opportunistic Protists (IWOP-12) was held in August 2012 in Tarrytown, New York. The objectives of the IWOP meetings are to: (1) serve as a forum for exchange of new information among active researchers concerning the basic biology, molecular genetics, immunology, biochemistry, pathogenesis, drug development, therapy, and epidemiology of these immunodeficiency-associated pathogenic eukaryotic microorganisms that are seen in patients with AIDS and (2) foster the entry of new and young investigators into these underserved research areas. The IWOP meeting focuses on opportunistic protists, e.g. the free-living amoebae, Pneumocystis, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, the Microsporidia, and kinetoplastid flagellates. This conference represents the major conference that brings together research groups working on these opportunistic pathogens. Slow but steady progress is being achieved on understanding the biology of these pathogenic organisms, their involvement in disease causation in both immune-deficient and immune-competent hosts, and is providing critical insights into these emerging and reemerging pathogens. This IWOP meeting demonstrated the importance of newly developed genomic level information for many of these pathogens and how analysis of such large data sets is providing key insights into the basic biology of these organisms. A great concern is the loss of scientific expertise and diversity in the research community due to the ongoing decline in research funding. This loss of researchers is due to the small size of many of these research communities and a lack of appreciation by the larger scientific community concerning the state of art and challenges faced by researchers working on these organisms.",

We assessed the influence of viewer age and culture on the association between descriptive and injunctive mental illness norms and reports of prosocial mental health-related behaviors (e.g., talking about suicide with others). Results indicated a positive association between the number of episodes viewed and perceived norms, and among viewers, descriptive and injunctive norms related to reports of mental health-related behavior change in all regions, although the process differed based on age and culture.

    "abstract": "Antiferromagnetically coupled Mn(III)Mn(IV) dimers have been commonly used to study biological systems that exhibit complex exchange interactions. Such is the case for the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II (PSII), where we have studied whether the C-terminal carboxylate of D1-Ala344 is directly bound to the Mn cluster. To probe these protein-derived carboxylate hyperfine interactions, which give direct bonding information, Q-band (34 GHz) Mims ENDOR was performed on a Mn(III)Mn(IV) dimer ([Mn(III)Mn(IV)(mu-O)(2)mu-OAc(TACN)(2)](BPh(4))(2)) (1) that was labeled with (13)C (I = (1)/(2)) at the carboxylate position of the acetate bridge. A(dip) is computed based on atomic coordinates from available X-ray crystal structures to be [-2.4, -0.8, 3.2] MHz. The value for A(iso) was determined based on simulation of the experimental ENDOR data, for complex 1 A(iso) = -1 MHz. Similar studies were then performed on PSII from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, in which all alanine-derived C=O groups are labeled with (13)C including the C-terminal alpha-COO(-) group of D1 (Ala344), as well as PSII proteins uniformly labeled with (13)C. Using recent X-ray crystallography data from T. elongatus the values for A(dip) were calculated and simulations of the experimental data led to A(iso) values of 1.2, 1, and 2 MHz, respectively. We infer from complex 1 that an A(iso) significantly larger than 1.2 MHz for a Mn-coordinating carboxylate moiety is unlikely. Therefore, we support the closer arrangement of Ala344 suggested by the Loll and Guskov structures and conclude that the C-terminal carboxylate of D1 polypeptide is directly bound to the Mn cluster.",

A series of robust, partially saturated analogues containing epoxide bioisosteres were synthesized and evaluated for relaxation of precontracted bovine coronary artery rings and for in vitro inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Depending upon the bioisostere and its position along the carbon chain, varying levels of vascular relaxation and/or sEH inhibition were observed. For example, oxamide 16 and N-iPr-amide 20 were comparable (ED(50) 1.7 microM) to 14,15-EET as vasorelaxants but were approximately 10-35 times less potent as sEH inhibitors (IC(50) 59 and 19 microM, respectively); unsubstituted urea 12 showed useful activity in both assays (ED(50) 3.5 microM, IC(50) 16 nM). These data reveal differential structural parameters for the two pharmacophores that could assist the development of potent and specific in vivo drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The L-type Ca 2+ channel (Ca V 1.2) is essential for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. To contribute to the inward Ca 2+ flux that drives Ca 2+ -induced-Ca 2+ -release, Ca V 1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune Ca V 1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca 2+ channel trafficking in non-myocytes, however whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on Ca V 1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including Na V 1.5 and hERG. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with Ca V 1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac Ca V 1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, super-resolution imaging, and co-immunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with Ca V 1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/Ca V 1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of β -adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated Ca V 1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs Ca V 1.2 super-clustering. 14-3-3 overexpression increased basal Ca V 1.2 cluster size and Ca 2+ currents in ventricular myocytes, with maintained channel responsivity to isoproterenol. In contrast, isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal Ca V 1.2 expression and currents in ventricular myocytes were abrogated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with Ca V 1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during β -adrenergic stimulation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The L-type Ca 2+ channel, Ca V 1.2, plays an essential role in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart and in part regulates the overall strength of contraction during basal and fight- or-flight β -adrenergic signaling conditions. Proteins that modulate the trafficking and/or activity of Ca V 1.2 are interesting both from a physiological and pathological perspective, since alterations in Ca V 1.2 can impact action potential duration and cause arrythmias. A small protein called 14-3-3 regulates other ion channels in the heart and other Ca 2+ channels, but how it may interact with Ca V 1.2 in the heart has never been studied. Examining factors that affect Ca V 1.2 at rest and during β -adrenergic stimulation is crucial for our ability to understand and treat disease and aging conditions where these pathways are altered.",

    "abstract": "PAR proteins play important roles in establishing cytoplasmic polarity as well as regulating spindle positioning during asymmetric division. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the PAR proteins generate asymmetry in different cell types are still being elucidated. Previous studies in Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that PAR-3 and PAR-1 regulate the asymmetric localization of LET-99, which in turn controls spindle positioning by affecting the distribution of the conserved force generating complex. In wild-type embryos, LET-99 is localized in a lateral cortical band pattern, via inhibition at the anterior by PAR-3 and at the posterior by PAR-1. In this report, we show that the 14-3-3 protein PAR-5 is also required for cortical LET-99 asymmetry. PAR-5 associated with LET-99 in pull-down assays, and two PAR-5 binding sites were identified in LET-99 using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Mutation of these sites abolished binding in yeast and altered LET-99 localization in vivo: LET-99 was present at the highest levels at the posterior pole of the embryo instead of a band in par-5 embryos. Together the results indicate that PAR-5 acts in a mechanism with PAR-1 to regulate LET-99 cortical localization.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that α cells contribute to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists potently potentiate GSIS, making these drugs useful for diabetes treatment. However, the role of α and β cell paracrine interactions in the effects of GLP-1R agonists is undefined. We previously found that increased β cell GLP-1R signaling activates α cell GLP-1 expression. Here, we characterized the bidirectional paracrine cross-talk by which α and β cells communicate to mediate the effects of the GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide. We find that the effect of liraglutide to enhance GSIS is blunted by α cell ablation in male mice. Furthermore, the effect of β cell GLP-1R signaling to activate α cell GLP-1 is mediated by a secreted protein factor that is regulated by the signaling protein, 14-3-3-zeta, in mouse and human islets. These data refine our understanding of GLP-1 pharmacology and identify 14-3-3-zeta as a potential target to enhance α cell GLP-1 production.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: We evaluated the effect of 3D conformai radiation therapy (3DCRT) on urinary function (UF) in prostate cancer patients whose urinary function scores were known prior to treatment in two groups of patients: those who had received hormonal therapy (HT) prior to radiation treatment, and those who did not receive any HT. Materials and Methods: Between September 1996 and November 2000, 86 patients received 3DCRT for prostate cancer and had UF data available both before and after treatment. All data was collected serially using a AUA/I-PSS Urological Symptom Survey, a validated, self-administered, validated instrument. Hormonal therapy consisted of 3 to 6 months of an LH RH agonist with or without an anti-androgen. The Wilcoxon rank sum tests as well as linear regression analysis were used to determine statistical significance. Results: Before 3-D CRT (median dose = 70 Gy), 30 patients (3 men excluded because of HT lasting 6 months.) that had received hormonal therapy had a significantly higher baseline AUA score than the 53 men receiving 3D CRT alone (10.7 vs.6.4, pO.Ol). At first follow-up and lyear follow-up visits, there were no significant declines in AUA scores. In comparing the relative change in scores between the two groups, we carried out linear regression analysis controlling for differing follow-up intervals. After adjusting for baseline score, volume, and dose, the slope of scores was not significantly different (-0.38 and -0.39 |P = 0.9] for 3D CRT alone group and HT group, respectively). Conclusion: Prior to any treatment, men receiving HT with 3D CRT tended to have significantly higher AUA symptom scores at baseline. After controlling for confounding factors, HT did not appear to influence post-treatment urinary function as compared to men receiving 3D CRT alone. These data suggest that HT does not contribute to additional urinary toxicity.",

Soil water chemistry in the deep vadose zone is first used to develop a chronology of paleohydrology and subsequently nitrogen fluxes. While elevated nitrogen concentrations (as NO3) are commonly found in desert vadose zones, NO3/Cl ratios indicate that nitrate behaved conservatively beneath the active rooting zone. Mean nitrogen fluxes from the active root zone range from 103 to 108 mg/m2/yr and appear relatively constant over time, in spite of dramatic climate and vegetation changes. The long-term loss of nitrogen from the active rooting zone implies that nitrogen cycling processes have been relatively constant since the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, that the biological community may not be primarily limited by the availability of nitrogen, and that the loss of nitrogen into the vadose zone should be considered in desert ecosystem productivity studies.",

A record apparent quantum efficiency of 14.8% at 525 nm was achieved after removing gallium and oxide charge trapping states from the GaP surface, adding a Ni2P cocatalyst to reduce the proton reduction overpotential, lowering the Schottky-barrier at the GaP-cocatalyst interface, adjusting the polarity of the depletion layer at the GaP-liquid interface, and optimizing the electrochemical potential of the electron donor. The work not only showcases the main factors that control charge separation in suspended photocatalysts, but it also explains why most known HER photocatalysts in the literature are based on n-type and not p-type semiconductors.",

To document seasonal patterns of C allocation, 2-year-old hybrid poplar trees greater than 3 m tall were labeled with (14)CO(2) in a large Plexiglas chamber in the field, in July and September. Climate and CO(2) concentration were controlled to track ambient conditions during labeling. Individual tree canopy CO(2) assimilation averaged 3.8 micromol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) (12.9 g C day(-1) tree(-1)) in July and 6.2 micromol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) (9.8 g C day(-1) tree(-1)) in September. Aboveground dark respiration was 12% of net daytime C fixation in July and 15% in September. Specific activity of root-soil respiration peaked 2 days after labeling and stabilized to less than 5% of maximum 2 weeks later. Low specific activity of root-soil respiration and a labeled pool of root C demonstrated that current photosynthate was the primary source of C for root growth and maintenance during the growing season. Root respiration averaged 20% of total soil respiration in both July and September based on the proportion of labeled C respired to labeled C fixed. In July, 80% of the recovered (14)C was found above ground and closely resembled the weight distribution of the growing shoot. By September, 51% of the recovered (14)C was in the root system and closely resembled the weight distribution of different size classes of roots.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the bioavailability of vitamin B-12 (B12) from in vivo labeled foods was determined by labeling the vitamin with radiocobalt (57Co, 58Co or 60Co). This required use of penetrating radioactivity and sometimes used higher doses of B12 than the physiological limit of B12 absorption. The aim of this study was to determine the bioavailability and absorbed B12 from chicken eggs endogenously labeled with 14C-B12 using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). 14C-B12 was injected intramuscularly into hens to produce eggs enriched in vivo with the 14C labeled vitamin. The eggs, which provided 1.4 to 2.6 μg of B12 (~1.1 kBq) per serving, were scrambled, cooked and fed to 10 human volunteers. Baseline and post-ingestion blood, urine and stool samples were collected over a one-week period and assessed for 14C-B12 content using AMS. Bioavailability ranged from 13.2 to 57.7% (mean 30.2 ± 16.4%). Difference among subjects was explained by dose of B12, with percent bioavailability from 2.6 μg only half that from 1.4 μg. The total amount of B12 absorbed was limited to 0.5-0.8 μg (mean 0.55 ± 0.19 μg B12) and was relatively unaffected by the amount consumed. The use of 14C-B12 offers the only currently available method for quantifying B12 absorption in humans, including food cobalamin absorption. An egg is confirmed as a good source of B12, supplying approximately 20% of the average adult daily requirement (RDA for adults = 2.4 μg/day).",

The overall mortality rate was 8.8%. Univariate analysis demonstrated that non-survivors had significantly higher chances of living in poverty (p=0.02). Similarly, univariate analysis showed that non-survivors were more likely to have frailty scores of 5 or greater compared to survivors. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed relationship between poverty and mortality (&amp;lt;20% vs &amp;gt;20%, OR 0.47 95% CI 0.25-0.89) and frailty and mortality ( &amp;gt;5 vs 1-4, OR 2.9 95%CI 1.4-5.8).

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring derivatives of arachidonic acid are potent agonists for the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and block cancer cell proliferation through the induction of apoptosis. We have previously reported that induction of apoptosis using cyclopentenone prostaglandins of the J series, including 15deoxydelta(12,14)PGJ(2) (15dPGJ(2)), is associated with a high degree of PPAR-response element (PPRE) activity and requires early de novo gene expression in breast cancer cells. In the current study, we used pharmacologic and genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that PPARgamma is required for 15dPGJ(2)-induced apoptosis. The PPARgamma agonists 15dPGJ(2), trogliltazone (TGZ), and GW7845, a synthetic and highly selective tyrosine-based PPARgamma agonist, all increased transcriptional activity of PPARgamma, and expression of CD36, a PPARgamma-dependent gene. Transcriptional activity and CD36 expression was reduced by GW9662, a selective and irreversible PPARgamma antagonist, but GW9662 did not block apoptosis induced by 15dPGJ(2). Moreover, dominant negative expression of PPARgamma blocked PPRE transcriptional activity, but did not block 15dPGJ(2)-induced apoptosis. These studies show that while 15dPGJ(2) activates PPRE-mediated transcription, PPARgamma is not required for 15dPGJ(2)-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Other likely mechanisms through which cyclopentenone prostaglandins induce apoptosis of cancer cells are discussed.",

    "abstract": "By use of 15N NMR spectroscopy, we have measured the pKa values of the aldimines 15N-(pyridoxyl-5'-phosphate-idine)-methylamine (2a), N-(pyridoxyl-5'-phosphate-15N-idine)-methylamine (2b), and 15N-(pyridoxyl-idine)-methylamine (3). These aldimines model the cofactor pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP, 1) in a variety of PLP-dependent enzymes. The acid-base properties of the aldimines differ substantially from those of the free cofactor in the aldehyde form 1a or in the hydrated form 1b, which were also investigated using 15N NMR for comparison. All compounds contain three protonation sites, the pyridine ring, the phenol group, and the side chain phosphate (1, 2) or hydroxyl group (3). In agreement with the literature, 1a exhibits one of several pKas at 2.9 and 1b at 4.2. The 15N chemical shifts indicate that the corresponding deprotonation occurs partially in the pyridine and partially in the phenolic site, which compete for the remaining proton. The equilibrium constant of this ring-phenolate tautomerism was measured to be 0.40 for 1a and 0.06 for 1b. The tautomerism is essentially unaltered above pH 6.1, where the phosphate group is deprotonated to the dianion. This means that the pyridine ring is more basic than the phenolate group. Pyridine nitrogen deprotonation occurs at 8.2 for 1a and at 8.7 for 1b. By contrast, above pH 4 the phosphate site of 2 is deprotonated, while the pyridine ring pKa is 5.8. The Schiff base nitrogen does not deprotonate below pH 11.4. When the phosphate group is removed, the pKa of the Schiff base nitrogen decreases to 10.5. The phenol site cannot compete for the proton of the Schiff base nitrogen and is present in the entire pH range as a phenolate, preferentially hydrogen bonded to the solvent. The intrinsic 15N chemical shifts provide information about the hydrogen bond structures of the protonated and unprotonated species involved. Evidence is presented that the intramolecular OHN hydrogen bond of PLP aldimines is broken in aqueous solution. The coupling between the inter- and intramolecular OHN hydrogen bonds is also lost in this environment. The pyridine ring of the PLP aldimines is not protonated in aqueous solution near neutral pH. The basicity of the aldimine nitrogens would be even lower without the doubly negatively charged phosphate group. Protonation of both the Schiff base and pyridine nitrogens has been discussed as a prerequisite for catalytic activity, and the implications of the present findings for PLP catalysis are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Human chromosome 15q11-13 is a complex locus containing imprinted genes as well as a cluster of three GABA(A) receptor subunit (GABR) genes-GABRB3, GABRA5 and GABRG3. Deletion or duplication of 15q11-13 GABR genes occurs in multiple human neurodevelopmental disorders including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS) and autism. GABRB3 protein expression is also reduced in Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in MECP2 on Xq28. Although Gabrb3 is biallelically expressed in mouse brain, conflicting data exist regarding the imprinting status of the 15q11-13 GABR genes in humans. Using coding single nucleotide polymorphisms we show that all three GABR genes are biallelically expressed in 21 control brain samples, demonstrating that these genes are not imprinted in normal human cortex. Interestingly, four of eight autism and one of five RTT brain samples showed monoallelic or highly skewed allelic expression of one or more GABR gene, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation of these genes is common to both disorders. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of PWS and AS samples with paternal and maternal 15q11-13 deletions revealed a paternal expression bias of GABRB3, while RTT brain samples showed a significant reduction in GABRB3 and UBE3A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and bisulfite sequencing in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that MeCP2 binds to methylated CpG sites within GABRB3. Our previous studies demonstrated that homologous 15q11-13 pairing in neurons was dependent on MeCP2 and was disrupted in RTT and autism cortex. Combined, these results suggest that MeCP2 acts as a chromatin organizer for optimal expression of both alleles of GABRB3 in neurons.",

Therefore, characterizing 15q11.2-13.3 chromatin structure is important for understanding the regulation of this locus during normal neuronal development. Deletion of the Prader-Willi imprinting center (PWS-IC) within 15q11.2-13.3 disrupts long-range imprinted gene expression resulting in Prader-Willi syndrome. Previous results establish that MeCP2 binds to the PWS-IC and is required for optimal expression of distal GABRB3 and UBE3A. To examine the hypothesis that MeCP2 facilitates 15q11.2-13.3 transcription by linking the PWS-IC with distant elements, chromosome capture conformation on chip (4C) analysis was performed in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y neurons had 2.84-fold fewer 15q11.2-13.3 PWS-IC chromatin interactions than undifferentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblasts, revealing developmental chromatin de-condensation of the locus. Out of 68 PWS-IC interactions with15q11.2-13.3 identified by 4C analysis and 62 15q11.2-13.3 MeCP2-binding sites identified by previous ChIP-chip studies, only five sites showed overlap. Remarkably, two of these overlapping PWS-IC- and MeCP2-bound sites mapped to sites flanking CHRNA7 (cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 7) encoding the cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha 7. PWS-IC interaction with CHRNA7 in neurons was independently confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Subsequent quantitative transcriptional analyses of frontal cortex from Rett syndrome and autism patients revealed significantly reduced CHRNA7 expression compared with controls. Together, these results suggest that transcription of CHRNA7 is modulated by chromatin interactions with the PWS-IC. Thus, loss of long-range chromatin interactions within 15q11.2-13.3 may contribute to multiple human neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "In a classical fixed sample design, the sample size is set in advance of collecting any data. The main design focus is choosing the sample size that allows the clinical trial to discriminate between the null hypothesis of no difference and the alternative hypothesis of a specified difference of scientific interest. A disadvantage of fixed sample design is that the same number of subjects will always be used regardless of whether the true treatment effect is extremely beneficial, marginal, or truly harmful relative to the control arm. Often, it is difficult to justify because of ethical concerns and/or economic reasons. Thus, specific early termination procedures have been developed to allow repeated statistical analyses to be performed on accumulating data and to stop the trial as soon as the information is sufficient to conclude. However, repeated analyses inflate the false positive error to an unacceptable level. To avoid this problem, many approaches of group sequential methods have been developed. Although there is an increase in the planned sample size under these designs, due to the sequential nature, substantial sample size reductions compared with the single-stage design is also possible not only in the case of clear efficacy but also in the case of complete lack of efficacy of the new treatment. This feature provides an advantage in utilization of patient resource. These approaches are methodologically complex but advancement in software packages had made the planning, monitoring, and analysis of comparative clinical trials according to these approaches quite simple. Despite this simplicity, the carrying on of a trial under group sequential design requires efficient logistics with dedicated team of data manager, study coordinator, biostatistician, and clinician. Good collaboration, rigorous monitoring, and guidance offered by an independent data safety monitoring committee are all indispensable pieces for its successful implementation. In this chapter, we provide a review of sequential designs and discuss the underlying premise of all current methods. We present a recent example and an historical example to illustrate the methods discussed and to provide a flavor of the variety and complexity in decision making. A comprehensive list of softwares is provided for easy implementation along with practical guidelines. Few areas with potential for future research are also identified. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The lensing mass is a galaxy at z = 0.630. New spectra of this system enable us to determine a conclusive redshift of 1.394 for the lensed object. The spectra show prominent high-order Balmer absorption lines and Mg II absorption. These lines, and the absence of [O II] emission, indicate that this is a poststarburst or E + A galaxy. It is unique among lensed objects in not being a quasar and among E + A galaxies in having the highest known redshift. Even allowing for lens magnification, the lensed object is a very luminous galaxy, with an absolute magnitude, M(r) = -22.8 mag. The deconvolved infrared image indicates that the galaxy may be slightly resolved. The radio luminosity density of the lobes is L1.4 = 5.78 × 1025 W Hz-1, which puts the source on the boundary between FR I and FR II radio galaxies. Together with the redshift for the lens and a satisfactory mass model, the determination of the lensed object redshift makes this system an excellent candidate for measuring H0. gravitational lensing © 1996.

    "abstract": "The first phase of a large gravitational lens survey using the Very Large Array at a wavelength of 3.6 cm has been completed, yielding images for 3258 radio sources. The Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) is designed to locate gravitational lens systems consisting of multiply imaged compact components with separations greater than 0”2. We report here the first discovery of a gravitational lens from the survey: 1608+656, a quadruply imaged object with a maximum separation of 2”i. Images from the Palomar 5 m and Keck 10 m telescopes show the lensed images and the lensing galaxy. An optical spectrum obtained with the Palomar 5 m telescope indicates a redshift of z = 0.6304 for the lensing galaxy. No conclusive redshift for the lensed object has been determined, although a single strong emission line is found at 9240 Å in the Keck low-resolution imaging spectrograph spectrum. The two most likely identifications for this line are Hβ (z = 0.90) and Mg II (z = 2.30). The preliminary lens model derived from the radio image reproduces the observed configuration and relative fluxes of the images, as well as the position, shape, and orientation of the lensing galaxy. Because a simple mass model is able to fit the observations, we argue that this lens system is promising for determining H0. © 1995 The American Astronomical Society.",

    "abstract": "The gravitational lens system 16081656 displays four flat-spectrum, pointlike components that are the images of the unresolved core of a double-lobed radio source. The lensing mass is a galaxy at z = 0.630. New spectra of this system enable us to determine a conclusive redshift of 1.394 for the lensed object. The spectra show prominent high-order Balmer absorption lines and Mg II absorption. These lines, and the absence of [O II] emission, indicate that this is a poststarburst or E 1 A galaxy. It is unique among lensed objects in not being a quasar and among E 1 A galaxies in having the highest known redshift. Even allowing for lens magnification, the lensed object is a very luminous galaxy, with an absolute magnitude, M(r) = 222.8 mag. The deconvolved infrared image indicates that the galaxy may be slightly resolved. The radio luminosity density of the lobes is L1.4 = 5.78 3 1025 W Hz21, which puts the source on the boundary between FR I and FR II radio galaxies. Together with the redshift for the lens and a satisfactory mass model, the determination of the lensed object redshift makes this system an excellent candidate for measuring H0.",

    "abstract": "Dairy farms generate a considerable amount of manure, which is applied in cropland as fertilizer. While the use of manure as fertilizer reduces the application of chemical fertilizers, the main concern with regards to manure application is microbial pollution. Manure is a reservoir of a broad range of microbial populations, including pathogens, which have potential to cause contamination and pose risks to public and animal health. Despite the widespread use of manure fertilizer, the change in microbial diversity of manure under various treatment processes is still not well-understood. We hypothesize that the microbial population of animal waste changes with manure handling used in a farm environment. Consequential microbial risk caused by animal manure may depend on manure handling. In this study, a reconnaissance effort for sampling dairy manure in California Central Valley followed by 16S rRNA analysis of content and diversity was undertaken to understand the microbiome of manure after various handling processes. The microbial community analysis of manure revealed that the population in liquid manure differs from that in solid manure. For instance, the bacteria of genus Sulfuriomonas were unique in liquid samples, while the bacteria of genus Thermos were observed only in solid samples. Bacteria of genus Clostridium were present in both solid and liquid samples. The population among liquid samples was comparable, as was the population among solid samples. These findings suggest that the mode of manure application (i.e., liquid versus solid) could have a potential impact on the microbiome of cropland receiving manure as fertilizers.",

Body weights were reduced about 20% after starting the 17aE2 diets. Four other interventions were tested in males and females: nicotinamide riboside, candesartan cilexetil, geranylgeranylacetone, and MIF098. Despite some data suggesting that nicotinamide riboside would be effective, neither it nor the other three increased lifespans significantly at the doses tested. The 17aE2 results confirm and extend our original reports, with very similar results when started at 16 months compared with mice started at 10 months of age in a prior study. The consistently large lifespan benefit in males, even when treatment is started late in life, may provide information on sex-specific aspects of aging.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacological treatments can extend mouse lifespan, but lifespan effects often differ between sexes. 17-α estradiol (17aE2), a less feminizing structural isomer of 17-β estradiol, produces lifespan extension only in male mice, suggesting a sexually dimorphic mechanism of lifespan regulation. We tested whether these anti-aging effects extend to anatomical and functional aging-important in late-life health-and whether gonadally derived hormones control aging responses to 17aE2 in either sex. While 17aE2 started at 4 months of age diminishes body weight in both sexes during adulthood, in late-life 17aE2-treated mice better maintain body weight. In 17aE2-treated male mice, the higher body weight is associated with heavier skeletal muscles and larger muscle fibers compared with untreated mice during aging, while treated females have heavier subcutaneous fat. Maintenance of skeletal muscle in male mice is associated with improved grip strength and rotarod capacity at 25 months, in addition to higher levels of most amino acids in quadriceps muscle. We further show that sex-specific responses to 17aE2-metabolomic, structural, and functional-are regulated by gonadal hormones in male mice. Castrated males have heavier quadriceps than intact males at 25 months, but do not respond to 17aE2, suggesting 17aE2 promotes an anti-aging skeletal muscle phenotype similar to castration. Finally, 17aE2 treatment benefits can be recapitulated in mice when treatment is started at 16 months, suggesting that 17aE2 may be able to improve aspects of late-life function even when started after middle age.",

    "abstract": "Correlations between estrogen and herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation from latency have been suggested by numerous clinical reports, but causal associations are not well delineated. In a murine HSV-1 corneal infection model, we establish 17-beta estradiol (17-betaE) treatment of latently infected ovariectomized mice induces viral reactivation, as demonstrated by increased viral load and increased immediate-early viral gene expression in the latently infected trigeminal ganglia (TG). Interestingly, the increased HSV reactivation occurred in the absence of inhibition of viral specific CD8(+) T-cell effector function. 17-betaE administration increased HSV reactivation in CD45(+) cell-depleted TG explant cultures, providing further support that leukocyte-independent effects on latently infected neurons were responsible for the increased reactivation. The drug-induced increases in HSV copy number were not recapitulated upon in vivo treatment of latently infected estrogen receptor alpha-deficient mice, evidence that HSV reactivation promoted by 17-betaE was estrogen receptor dependent. These findings provide additional framework for the emerging conceptualization of HSV latency as a dynamic process maintained by complex interactions among multiple cooperative and competing host, viral, and environmental forces. Additional research is needed to confirm whether pregnancy or hormonal contraceptives containing 17-betaE also promote HSV reactivation from latency in an estrogen receptor-dependent manner.",

Key issues, including detector noise, excess light source noise, chromatic dispersion, and the resolution-speckle tradeoff, are analyzed and optimized. Imaging through a thinned-skull preparation that preserves intracranial space, we present volumetric imaging of cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture across the entire depth of the mouse neocortex, and some sub-cortical regions.

Previous works focusing on 17O-excess in polar regions suggest that it primarily tracks moisture source relative humidity, but little is known about how to interpret 17O-excess data in lower latitudes. Here we present quasi-hourly triple oxygen isotope data of precipitation collected from two tropical cyclones in Texas and Louisiana in 2020 to understand the impacts of environmental and meteorological processes on the 17O-excess of low-to mid-latitude precipitation. We find that at both hourly timescales and the event scale, 17O-excess is strongly correlated to changes in on-site rainfall intensity and relative humidity, which is consistent with the theory that the isotopic fractionation associated with rain re-evaporation lowers the 17O-excess of the remaining droplet. In addition, although evaporative conditions at the moisture source region may also influence 17O-excess of water vapor transported to the precipitation site, their impacts are likely overprinted by the post-condensation rain re-evaporation processes. Our results thus suggest that 17O-excess can be used as a proxy for local rather than source region evaporative conditions during tropical cyclones.",

One of the mechanisms suggested to explain this link takes into account the ability of E2 to counteract oxidative stress (OS) which is believed to play an important role in several pathogenic processes. AIM: To investigate whether stages of women's life characterized by different levels of E2 influence OS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study of OS markers in 159 women subdivided in 65 pre-menopausal, 36 peri-menopausal, and 58 post-menopausal classified according to the Staging of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) criteria. E2, follicle-stimulating hormone, and markers of OS including hydroperoxides, thiols, uric acid, total and residual antioxidant power, were assessed. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, only total antioxidant power was significantly different according to menopausal status (p <0.01), with lower value in pre- with respect peri- and post-menopausal women. No significant correlations between E2 levels and OS markers were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Endogen E2, and, consequently, its decline during menopausal transition, is not a determinant factor for OS.",

ERalpha-deficient (ERalpha-/-) and wild-type (ERalpha+/+) female mice consuming an atherogenic diet were studied concurrent with estrogen replacement to distinguish the actions of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) from those of ERalpha on the development of early atherosclerotic lesions. Mice were ovariectomized and implanted with subcutaneous slow-release pellets designed to deliver 6 or 8 mug/day of exogenous 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) for a period of up to 4 months. Ovariectomized mice (OVX) with placebo pellets (E(2)-deficient controls) were compared to mice with endogenous E(2) (intact ovaries) and exogenous E(2). Aortas were analyzed for lesion area, number, and distribution. Lipid and hormone levels were also determined. Compared to OVX, early lesion development was significantly (p < 0.001) attenuated by E(2) with 55-64% reduction in lesion area by endogenous E(2) and >90% reduction by exogenous E(2). Compared to OVX, a decline in lesion number (2- to 4-fold) and lesser predilection (~4-fold) of lesion formation in the proximal aorta also occurred with E(2). Lesion size, development, number, and distribution inversely correlated with circulating plasma E(2) levels. However, atheroprotection was independent of ERalpha status, and E(2) athero-protection in both genotypes was not explained by changes in plasma lipid levels (total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). The ERalpha is not essential for endogenous/exogenous E(2)-mediated protection against early-stage atherosclerosis. These observations have potentially significant implications for understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms and timing of estrogen action in different estrogen receptor (ER) deletion murine models of atherosclerosis, as well as implications to human studies of ER polymorphisms and lipid metabolism. Our findings may contribute to future improved clinical decision-making concerning the use of hormone therapy.",

    "abstract": "The actions of substance P (SP), a widely distributed tachykinin neuropeptide, are mediated by the NK1 receptor, a seven trans-membrane spanning domain cell surface receptor coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins. SP regulates cellular processes in the CNS, placenta and vasculature including permeability, inflammation, mitogenesis and transformation. Examples of sexual dimorphism in tissue distribution and expression of SP and the SP receptor (SPR) in various organ systems (breast, uterus, brain) suggest the SPR may be under hormonal control. Using Northern blot analysis of SPR mRNA levels, we studied the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on SPR gene expression in AR42J (rat pancreatic acinar) cells which constitutively express high levels of SPR. E2 (100 nM) led to a 2.5-fold increase in SPR mRNA levels (4.7 kb band) which was time- and concentration-dependent. The increase was inhibited by the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D (5 microg/ml) but not by the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (10 microg/ml). In addition, the antiestrogen tamoxifen (1 microM) blocked the stimulatory effect of E2 on SPR mRNA. Increased SPR mRNA levels in response to E2 were linearly related to increased [3H]SP binding to the SPR. This study has implications for understanding molecular mechanisms of hormonal control of receptor gene expression.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported sex differences in mesenteric arterial function of the UC Davis type-2 diabetes mellitus (UCD-T2DM) rats as early as the prediabetic state. We reported that mesenteric arteries (MA) from prediabetic male rats exhibited a greater impairment compared to that in prediabetic females. However, when females became diabetic, they exhibited a greater vascular dysfunction than males. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the female sex hormone, estrogen preserves mesenteric arterial vasorelaxation in UCD-T2DM female rats at an early prediabetic state. Age-matched female Sprague Dawley and prediabetic (PD) UCD-T2DM rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and subcutaneously implanted with either placebo or 17β-estradiol (E2, 1.5 mg) pellets for 45 days. We assessed the contribution of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRF) to acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasorelaxation, using pharmacological inhibitors. Responses to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and phenylephrine (PE) were also measured. Additionally, metabolic parameters and expression of some targets associated with vascular and insulin signaling were determined. We demonstrated that the responses to ACh and SNP were severely impaired in the prediabetic state (PD OVX) rats, while E2 treatment restored vasorelaxation in the PD OVX + E2. Moreover, the responses to PE was significantly enhanced in MA of PD OVX groups, regardless of placebo or E2 treatment. Overall, our data suggest that 1) the impairment of ACh responses in PD OVX rats may, in part, result from the elevated contractile responses to PE, loss of contribution of endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (EDH) to vasorelaxation, and a decreased sensitivity of MA to nitric oxide (NO), and 2) the basis for the protective effects of E2 may be partly attributed to the elevation of the NO contribution to vasorelaxation and its interaction with MA as well as potential improvement of insulin signaling. Here, we provide the first evidence of the role of E2 in protecting MA from early vascular dysfunction in prediabetic female rats.",

SP regulates cellular processes in the CMS, placenta and vasculature including permeability, angiogenesis, mitogenesis, and transformation. Examples of sexual dimorphism in cellular function suggest genetic hormonal control. Using Northern blot analysis of SPR mRNA levels we studied the effects of E2 on SPR gene expression in AR42 j (rat pancreatic acinar) cells which constitutively express high levels of SPR. E2 was incubated with AR42J cells in low hormone serum for 0, '/S, 1, 2, and 4 hrs Total RNAwas isolated from cells using phenol chloroform extraction and poly A selected with oligo (dT) columns. Samples were run on formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with [alz-P] dCTP labelled random pnmer cDNA probes at high stringency. Radiographs were developed after 1-3 days. The level of SPR mRNA was normalized to a marker cDNA for Chinese hamster ovary cells by a ratio of the 2 densitometry signals expressed as percent change from control (E, at time 0). E, (100nM) led to an 89% increase in SPR mRNA levels (4.7 kb band) and the appearance of a novel approx. 2 kb band suggesting a possible alternatively spliced variant. The effect was greatest after 1-3 hours and was concentration (0.1-1000nM) dependent with a peak response at 100nM E2 . The response was inhibited by the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D (5 ug/ml) but not by the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (10 ug/ml) In addition, the antiestrogen tamoxifen (1 uM) blocked the stimulatory effect of E2 on SPR mRNA. In conclusion, our studies indicate that E2 stimulates SPR gene expression,.that the control is at the level of transcription and involves interaction with the E2R. This study has implications for hormonal control of vasoactive peptide gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Many 17-substituted androstan-3alpha-ol analogs act as positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors and exert anticonvulsant and anxiolytic-like activity actions in animal models. The endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone (17beta-acetyl; 1) is among the most potent of these. Here we demonstrate that 3alpha-hydroxy-17beta-nitro-5alpha-androstane (2b) and its 3beta-methyl analog (3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-17beta-nitro-5alpha-androstane; 2c) modulate GABA(A) receptors as assessed by [(35)S]t-butylbicyclo-phosphorothionate and [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding with potencies equivalent to or greater than 1. These compounds also had potencies equivalent to or greater than 1 in the pentylenetetrazol and 6Hz seizure models in the mouse. Furthermore, 2b exhibited anxiolytic-like activity in the elevated zero maze. The 3beta-hydroxy, 3alpha-desmethyl analog (2a) was devoid of activity on GABA(A) receptors in vitro but had moderate activity in the seizure models, possibly as a result of epimerization in vivo at the 3-position. This conclusion was supported by the lack of in vivo activity of the 3beta-hydroxy, 3alpha-methyl analog (2d), which is not expected to undergo epimerization. We conclude that nitro can serve as a bioisostere for acetyl at the 17beta-position of 5alpha-androstan-3alpha-ol, such that the nitro analog fully retains the bioactivity of the endogenous neurosteroid at GABA(A) receptors.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at high risk (HR) for developing ASD as well as features of the broader autism phenotype. Although this complicates early diagnostic considerations in this cohort, it also provides an opportunity to examine patterns of behavior associated specifically with ASD compared to other developmental outcomes. METHOD: We applied Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis to individual items of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) in 719 HR siblings to identify behavioral features at 18 months that were predictive of diagnostic outcomes (ASD, atypical development, and typical development) at 36 months. RESULTS: Three distinct combinations of features at 18 months were predictive of ASD outcome: poor eye contact combined with lack of communicative gestures and giving; poor eye contact combined with a lack of imaginative play; and lack of giving and presence of repetitive behaviors, but with intact eye contact. These 18-month behavioral profiles predicted ASD versus non-ASD status at 36 months with 82.7% accuracy in an initial test sample and 77.3% accuracy in a validation sample. Clinical features at age 3 years among children with ASD varied as a function of their 18-month symptom profiles. Children with ASD who were misclassified at 18 months were higher functioning, and their autism symptoms increased between 18 and 36 months. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the presence of different developmental pathways to ASD in HR siblings. Understanding such pathways will provide clearer targets for neural and genetic research and identification of developmentally specific treatments for ASD.",

The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of the TSP through baffles, conduits, pericardial patches and other prosthetic materials in the intra-atrial septum. We reviewed the records of all pediatric patients with IAP who underwent TSP at Texas Children's Hospital from November 1979 through February 1998. The review included the cardiac diagnoses, indications for TSP, technical difficulties and follow up echocardiograms specifically addressing residual atrial shunts A total of 1958 TSP were performed. Thirty-nine patients had IAP. Cardiac diagnoses in those 39 patients included D-transposition of the great arteries after Mustard (10) or Senning procedure (6), single ventricle variant post-Fontan operation (4), total anomalous venous return repair (4), atrioventricular canal repair (9) and atrial septal defect with patch repair (6). Patients' age ranged from 1-31 years (median 7 years). The duration from the time of surgical repair to TSP ranged from 0.1-21 years (median 5 years). Indications for TSP included diagnostic and therapeutic intervention for pulmonary venous obstruction (12), creation of a baffle fenestration (2), prosthetic mitral valve evaluation (1), left ventricular outflow tract evaluation (1), access the left heart for hemodynamic evaluation (23). The IAP was traversed in 38/39 patients (97.5%), followed by diagnostic or therapeutic prograde left-heart catheterization. No complications were encountered. Follow up echocardiography in 30/38 PTS demonstrated no residual shunting across the atrial septum except for two cases in which the atrial baffle had been intentionally fenestrated. Transseptal puncture through an intra-atrial patch is a safe procedure. This technique is effective in permitting diagnostic and therapeutic left heart catheterization and does not result in residual shunting through the patch.",

    "abstract": "We integrate new high-resolution aeromagnetic data with seismic reflection data, well logs, satellite remote sensing, and field observations to provide a regional view of buried and exposed structures in the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen and to assess their potential for future seismicity. Trends ranging from NW–SE to ~E–W, peaking at 330° ± 4.5° and 280° ± 3°, dominate the magnetic lineaments of the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, reflecting basement contacts, dikes, and faults, including a previously unmapped ∼100-km-long basement fault, which is herein referred to as the Willow fault. The fault disrupts, truncates, and vertically offsets basement-related seismic reflectors and overlying Paleozoic strata up through the Permian reflectors. Surface deformation along the trend includes fault-parallel monoclinal folds, pervasive fractures, and fracture-hosted mud dikes in Permian evaporite units. These structures indicate a Permian or post-Permian reactivation of the fault. Along-strike, the Willow fault connects to the NW-trending, seismically active Meers Fault to comprise the ~180-km-long Meers-Willow fault system, which potentially represents a major seismic hazard along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen. Fault slip potential analyses of the mapped potential fault traces show that seismic hazards are elevated where faults have steeper dips. Given some uncertainty in the regional stress state, we also show that hazards along the NW–SE to E–W trending faults vary considerably within the uncertainty range. We propose that the Meers-Willow fault system originated as a Cambrian aulacogen-scale, basement-rooted fault that was later reactivated as a left-lateral strike-slip fault (with ~40 km displacement) during the late Paleozoic Ancestral Rocky Mountain orogeny, highlighting that lateral offset accommodated a major component of deformation during the orogen.",

    "abstract": "Despite the prevalence and significant morbidity resulting from estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast adenocarcinomas, there are only a few models of this cancer subtype available for drug development and arguably none for studying etiology. Those models that do exist have questionable clinical relevance. Given our goal of developing luminal models, we focused on six cell lines derived by minimal mutagenesis from normal human breast cells, and asked if any could generate clinically relevant xenografts, which we then extensively characterized. Xenografts of one cell line, 184AA3, consistently formed ER+ adenocarcinomas that had a high proliferative rate and other features consistent with “luminal B” intrinsic subtype. Squamous and spindle cell/mesenchymal differentiation was absent, in stark contrast to other cell lines that we examined or others have reported. We explored intratumoral heterogeneity produced by 184AA3 by immunophenotyping xenograft tumors and cultured cells, and characterized marker expression by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. A CD44High subpopulation was discovered, yet their tumor forming ability was far less than CD44Low cells. Single cell cloning revealed the phenotypic plasticity of 184AA3, consistent with the intratumoral heterogeneity observed in xenografts. Characterization of ER expression in cultures revealed ER protein and signaling is intact, yet when estrogen was depleted in culture, and in vivo, it did not impact cell or tumor growth, analogous to therapeutically resistant ER+ cancers. This model is appropriate for studies of the etiology of ovarian hormone independent adenocarcinomas, for identification of therapeutic targets, predictive testing, and drug development.",

    "abstract": "A Re-containing sample is irradiated with thermal neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The following reactions occur with high cross sections: 185Re(n, γ)186Re and 187Re(n, γ)188Re. Both 186Re (half-life 90.6 h) and 188Re (16.7 h) β-decay to the stable isotopes 186Os and 188Os. Thus 186Os and 188Os are enriched in proportion to the neutron fluence and Re/Os ratio of the sample being irradiated. Analysing merely the isotopic composition of the sample, we get two ages that should be consistent. In one irradiated molybdenite sample from Kingsgate molybdenum mine in New South Wales, Australia, the measured  186Os 192Os and  188Os 192Os are 0.3284 and 0.6299, whereas in an unirradiated sample they are assumed to be 0.0390 and 0.3248. These ratios are measurable with negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry (N-TIMS) to a precision of 1‰. The derived ages for this sample are t186 = 220.5 ± 8.7 Ma and t188 = 214.9 ± 8.9 Ma, respectively (or ±1.4 Ma and ±1.7 Ma, respectively, when excluding the uncertainty of 187Re half-life). These values are in close agreement with the 221-238 Ma K-Ar ages of the leucogranites emplacement that causes the Mo mineralization at Kingsgate (Evernden and Richards, 1962; Kleeman, 1988; Gilligan and Barnes, 1990). The major limiting factor on the precision of this age determination is the uncertainty in the half-life of 187Re. The errors associated with the irradiation parameters are greatly reduced by choosing an appropriate neutron flux monitor. The advantage of this method is that the Re Os ratio is determined on the same sample and that only one measurement of the isotopic composition of osmium is required, thus overcoming some of the experimental difficulties of the conventional Re-Os analysis. The problem of sample inhomogeneity (which is a serious problem for the Re-Os system) and the need to measure the absolute concentrations of rhenium and osmium are thus eliminated. With this method, it is potentially possible to obtain an age spectrum of the disturbed Re-Os system with selective leaching steps or by in situ analysis. © 1993.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanners are characterized by higher signal collection efficiency and greater spatial resolution compared to conventional scanners, allowing for delayed imaging and improved image quality. These advantages may also lead to better detection of physiological processes that diagnostic imaging professionals should be aware of. The gallbladder (GB) is not usually visualized as an 18F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-avid structure in routine clinical PET/CT studies; however, with the total-body PET/CT, we have been increasingly visualizing GB activity without it being involved in an inflammatory or neoplastic process. The aim of this study was to report visualization rates and characteristics of GB 18F-FDG uptake observed in both healthy and oncological subjects scanned on a total-body PET/CT system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scans from 73 participants (48 healthy and 25 with newly diagnosed lymphoma) who underwent 18F-FDG total-body PET/CT were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were scanned at multiple timepoints up to 3 h post-injection. Gallbladder 18F-FDG activity was graded using liver uptake as a reference, and the pattern was qualified as present in the wall, lumen, or both. Participants' characteristics, such as age, sex, body-mass index, blood glucose, and other clinical parameters, were collected to assess for any significant correlation with GB 18F-FDG uptake. RESULTS: All 73 subjects showed GB uptake at one or more imaging timepoints. An increase in uptake intensity overtime was observed up until the 180-min scan, and the visualization rate of GB 18F-FDG uptake was 100% in the 120- and 180-min post-injection scans. GB wall uptake was detected in a significant number of patients (44/73, 60%), especially at early timepoint scans, whereas luminal activity was detected in 71/73 (97%) subjects, especially at later timepoint scans. No significant correlation was found between GB uptake intensity/pattern and subjects' characteristics. CONCLUSION: The consistent observation of GB 18F-FDG uptake recorded in this study in healthy participants and subjects with a new oncological diagnosis indicates that this is a normal physiologic finding rather than representing an exception.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with chemoradiotherapy can now accomplish excellent locoregional disease control, but patient overall survival (OS) remains limited by development of distant metastases (DM). We investigated the prognostic value of staging (18)F-FDG PET/CT, beyond clinical risk factors, for predicting DM and OS in 176 patients after definitive chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: The PET parameters maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were recorded. Univariate Cox regression was used to examine the prognostic value of these variables and clinical prognosticators for local treatment failure (LTF), OS, and DM. Multivariate analysis examined the effect of SUVmax, TLG, and MTV in the presence of other covariates. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate prognostic values of PET/CT parameters. RESULTS: Primary tumors were distributed across all stages. Most patients underwent chemoradiotherapy only, and 11 also underwent tonsillectomy. On univariate analysis, primary tumor MTV was predictive of LTF (P = 0.005, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.4 for a doubling of MTV), DM and OS (P < 0.001 for both, HR = 1.9 and 1.8, respectively). The primary tumor TLG was associated with DM and OS (P < 0.001, HR = 1.6 and 1.7, respectively, for a doubling of TLG). The primary tumor SUVmax was associated with death (P = 0.029, HR = 1.1 for a 1-unit increase in standardized uptake value) but had no relationship with LTF or DM. In multivariate analysis, TLG and MTV remained associated with death after correcting for T stage (P = 0.0125 and 0.0324, respectively) whereas no relationship was seen between standardized uptake value and death after adjusting for T stage (P = 0.158). CONCLUSION: Parameters capturing the volume of (18)F-FDG-positive disease (MTV or TLG) provide important prognostic information in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy and should be considered for risk stratification in this disease.",

Plantar fibromatosis is a locally invasive neoplasm, with the development of fibrous nodules on the plantar aspect of the feet, which can remain asymptomatic for years. (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT has been more prevalent as the imaging modality of choice for cancer patients, but the imaged field of view is often from the base of the skull to the upper thighs. Therefore, the feet are typically not included in the field. However, true whole-body imaging from the top of the skull to the bottom of the feet is performed at some institutions and can provide clinically useful findings. One such finding is the presence of (18)F-FDG-avid plantar nodules.

Purpose To assess the role of 18F-FSPG PET/CT in intracranial malignancies. Materials and Methods Twenty-six patients (mean age, 54 years ± 12; 17 men; 48 total lesions) with primary brain tumors (n = 17) or brain metastases (n = 9) were enrolled in this prospective, single-center study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02370563) between November 2014 and March 2016. A 30-minute dynamic brain 18F-FSPG PET/CT scan and a static whole-body (WB) 18F-FSPG PET/CT scan at 60-75 minutes were acquired. Moreover, all participants underwent MRI, and four participants underwent fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging. PET parameters and their relative changes were obtained for all lesions. Kinetic modeling was used to estimate the 18F-FSPG tumor rate constants using the dynamic and dynamic plus WB PET data. Imaging parameters were correlated to lesion outcomes, as determined with follow-up MRI and/or pathologic examination. The Mann-Whitney U test or Student t test was used for group mean comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used for performance comparison of different decision measures. Results 18F-FSPG PET/CT helped identify all 48 brain lesions. The mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) on the whole-brain PET images at the WB time point was 26.6 ± 24.9 (range: 2.6-150.3). When 18F-FDG PET was performed, 18F-FSPG permitted visualization of non-18F-FDG-avid lesions or allowed better lesion differentiation from surrounding tissues. In participants with primary brain tumors, the predictive accuracy of the relative changes in influx rate constant Ki and maximum standardized uptake value to discriminate between poor and good lesion outcomes were 89% and 81%, respectively. There were significant differences in the 18F-FSPG uptake curves of lesions with good versus poor outcomes in the primary brain tumor group (P < .05) but not in the brain metastases group. Conclusion PET/CT imaging with (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate (18F-FSPG) helped detect primary brain tumors and brain metastases with a high tumor-to-background ratio. Relative changes in 18F-FSPG uptake with multi-time-point PET appear to be helpful in predicting lesion outcomes. Clinical trial registration no.

METHODS: In this feasibility proof-of-concept study, 18F-NaF μPET scan and μCT scan were obtained on Hispaniolan (Amazona ventralis) and orange-winged Amazon parrots (A amazonica). A different μPET scan protocol was used for each species. Images were reviewed by 3 observers for arterial calcification and radiotracer uptake indicative of atherosclerosis. A blood lipid profile was also performed. A subset of Hispaniolan Amazon parrots were euthanized after completion of the study, and the heart and arteries were collected for histopathology. RESULTS: 10 adult Hispaniolan and 8 adult orange-winged Amazon parrots were scanned. Atherosclerotic lesions were detected on both μCT and μPET scan in various arteries. The presence of streak artifacts and increased noise on μCT scan limited the ability to detect high-attenuation areas of arteries and obtain observer consensus except for 1 case of severe arterial calcification. μPET scan was overall more sensitive, had higher interobserver agreement in lesion scoring, and detected a higher number of lesions in both species, including in coronary arteries. On histopathology on 5 Amazon parrots, the majority (5/6) of clinically relevant atherosclerotic lesions and some preatheromatous lesions (1/3) were identified on μPET scan. No association between atherosclerosis detection on μPET scan and the lipid profile was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study established a safe and effective protocol for 18F-NaF molecular imaging of psittacine atherosclerosis, which proved to be more sensitive than CT scan. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 18F-sodium fluoride PET scan allows for a more reliable and earlier diagnosis of atherosclerotic lesions in Amazon parrots.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a cross-sectional, functional imaging modality that has recently become available to the horse. The use of 18 F-sodium fluoride (18 F-NaF), a PET bone tracer, has not previously been reported in this species. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of 18 F-NaF PET in the equine distal limb and explore possible applications in the horse in comparison with other imaging modalities. STUDY DESIGN: Exploratory descriptive study involving three research horses. METHODS: Horses were placed under general anaesthesia prior to intravenous (i.v.) administration of 1.5 MBq/kg of 18 F-NaF. Positron emission tomography imaging of both front feet and fetlocks was performed using a portable scanner. Computed tomography (CT) of the distal limb was performed under a separate anaesthetic episode. Bone scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were subsequently performed under standing sedation. Images obtained from PET and other imaging modalities were independently assessed and the results correlated. RESULTS: Positron emission tomography images were obtained without complication. The radiation exposure rate was similar to equine bone scintigraphy. Positron emission tomography detected focal 18 F-NaF uptake in areas where other imaging modalities did not identify any abnormalities. This included sites of ligamentous attachment, subchondral compact bone plate and the flexor cortex of the navicular bone. 18 F-NaF uptake was identified in some, but not all, osseous fragments and areas of osseous formation, suggesting a distinction between active and inactive lesions. MAIN LIMITATIONS: A small number of horses were included and histopathology was not available. CONCLUSIONS: 18 F-NaF PET imaging of the equine distal limb provides useful additional information when compared with CT, MRI and scintigraphy and has the potential for both research and clinical applications in the horse.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early and accurate detection of stress remodelling in racehorses is of utmost importance to prevent catastrophic injuries. Current imaging techniques have limitations in assessing early changes predisposing to catastrophic breakdowns. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18 F-sodium fluoride (18 F-NaF) is a sensitive method for the detection of early bone turnover and may improve early recognition of subtle injuries. OBJECTIVES: To validate the clinical use of 18 F-NaF PET in Thoroughbred racehorses, to assess the value of PET in the detection of bone lesions and to compare PET results with findings of other advanced imaging modalities, clinical examination and pathology. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental exploratory study. METHODS: Twenty fetlocks from nine Thoroughbred racehorses were imaged using 18 F-NaF PET, computed tomography (CT) and scintigraphy. Five fetlocks were also imaged with magnetic resonance imaging and four fetlocks were also examined histologically. Imaging findings were independently reviewed by three board certified radiologists. Imaging, clinical and histopathological findings were correlated. RESULTS: PET imaging was well-tolerated by all horses. PET detected focal areas of 18 F-NaF uptake in instances where other imaging modalities did not identify abnormalities, in particular in the proximal sesamoid bones. Maximal standardised uptake values could be measured to quantify the activity of lesions. Areas of 18 F-NaF uptake corresponded to regions of increased vascularity and increased osteoblastic activity. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: 18 F-NaF PET imaging of the Thoroughbred fetlock is feasible and compares favourably with other imaging modalities in detecting stress remodelling in Thoroughbred racehorses. PET appears to be a beneficial imaging modality when used for early detection of stress remodelling in an effort to prevent catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries in this population of horses.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) for imaging the tarsus and proximal metatarsus and compare it with CT and lameness evaluation. ANIMALS: 25 horses with lameness localized to the tarsal and proximal metatarsal regions that underwent 18F-NaF PET/CT between 2016 and 2021. METHODS: 18F-NaF PET and CT images were retrospectively independently evaluated by 3 observers. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were used to characterize 18F-NaF uptake. Correlation between PET and CT findings with subjective and objective maximum (Max-D) and minimum pelvic height lameness data was estimated. RESULTS: The inter-observer Kappa-weighted value (κ) was higher for PET (κ = 0.66) than CT (κ = 0.6). CT and PET scores were fairly correlated (R = 0.49; P < 0.05). PET SUVratio (SUV of the main lesion/SUV talus) had the highest correlation with Max-D (R = 0.71; P < .05). PET and CT scores for the plantar region were significantly higher in Quarter Horses (P < .05) and showed consistently higher correlation with objective lameness data (CT plantar grade - Max-D [R = 0.6; P < .05], PET plantar grade - Max-D [R = 0.47; P = .04]) than other regions of the distal tarsal joints. Three Warmbloods presented marked uptake at the medial cochlea of the distal tibia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PET had a moderate correlation with CT for assessment of tarsal lesions. The degree of PET uptake can help differentiate active versus inactive lesions. Specific location of the uptake is important in determining clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Lesions of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) are a cause for foot lameness in horses. Positron emission tomography (PET) could provide valuable information regarding the metabolic activity of these lesions. The aims of this exploratory, prospective, methods comparison study were to assess the ability of 18 fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET to detect DDFT lesions and to compare the PET findings with CT and MRI findings. Eight horses with lameness due to pain localized to the front feet were included. Both front limbs of all horses were imaged with 18 F-FDG PET, noncontrast CT, and arterial contrast-enhanced CT; 11 limbs were also assessed using MRI. Two observers graded independently 18 F-FDG PET, noncontrast CT, arterial contrast CT, T1-weighted (T1-w) MRI, and T2-weighted (T2-w)/STIR MRI. Maximal standardized uptake values were measured. Lesions were found in seven of 16 DDFT on PET, 12 of 16 DDFT on noncontrast CT, six of 15 DDFT on arterial contrast CT, eight of 11 DDFT on T1-w MRI, and six of 11 DDFT on T2-w/STIR MRI. Positron emission tomography was in better agreement with arterial contrast CT (Kappa-weighted 0.40) and T2-w/STIR MRI (0.35) than with noncontrast CT (0.28) and T1-w MRI (0.20). Maximal standardized uptake values of lesions ranged from 1.9 to 4.6 with a median of 3.1. Chronic lesions with scar tissues identified on noncontrast CT or T1-w MRI did not have increased 18 F-FDG uptake. These results demonstrated that 18 F-FDG PET agreed more closely with modalities previously used to detect active tendon lesions, i.e. arterial contrast CT and T2-w/STIR MRI. 18 Fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose PET can be used to identify metabolically active DDFT lesions in horses.",

The underlying assumption of this comparative approach is that traditionally-bred animals have a well-established history of safe use. The goal of this project was to provide empirical data on the development and nutritional composition of animal products derived from the offspring of a genome edited dairy bull, homozygous for the dominant PC Celtic POLLED allele. The bull was crossed with horned Hereford (HH) cows (pp) to obtain five male and one female heterozygous hornless (RC) calves. Hereford, Angus and Holstein bulls were also bred to Hereford cows to produce five HH calves, two polled Angus/Hereford (AH) calves, and three horned Holstein/Hereford (HO) calves (with 25% genetic identity to the hornless offspring), respectively as contemporary controls. Weights were recorded at 8 months, 1 year and slaughter (n = 9–16). Following calving, individual quarters of the RC heifer (RC.calf1), one HO heifer (HO.calf2), two horned HH heifers, and one contemporaneous hornless AH cow (3113) were milked at varying timepoints during the first seven weeks of lactation. Meat samples were collected from the 6 hornless RC calves and 3 horned HO comparator offspring after slaughter. Proximate analysis was conducted for meat and milk samples. Cattle that inherited a POLLED allele from the genome-edited bull showed no differences in their overall growth (Figure 1) or meat composition (Figure 2) when compared to contemporary controls. Milk composition varied between animals and by days in milk (DIM), although values were within the normal range reported in peer-reviewed literature (Figure 3). Bovine milk composition is known to be influenced by breed, nutrition, parity, and DIM, making it difficult to obtain appropriate comparators in experiments with a limited number of GM animals.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p />\n               <jats:p />\n               <jats:p />\n               <jats:p />",

The AMS blocks excite the main VCOs to operate in two distinct frequency bands. An overlap between the two frequency bands has extended the tuning range of the VCO. By turning the AMS blocks off, low-loss and low-capacitance behaviors of these blocks result in wide tuning range and high harmonic output power at high millimeter-wave frequencies. On the other hand, by turning the AMS blocks on, their loss-canceling and capacitance-tuning behaviors yield to higher power and wider tuning range with a lower center frequency. By having sufficient frequency overlap between the two modes, the implemented VCO achieves record tuning range of 20.7% at 190.5 GHz with a maximum output power of -2.1 dBm. This tuning range is significantly higher than reported silicon-based VCOs with center frequencies higher than 120 GHz.",

Alternatively, we demonstrate that fluorine (19F) MRI of cells labeled with different types of liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoparticles produces unique and sensitive cell markers distinct from any tissue background signal. To define the utility for cell tracking, mononuclear cells harvested from human umbilical cord blood were grown under proendothelial conditions and labeled with nanoparticles composed of two distinct PFC cores (perfluorooctylbromide and perfluoro-15-crown-5 ether). The sensitivity for detecting and imaging labeled cells was defined on 11.7T (research) and 1.5T (clinical) scanners. Stem/progenitor cells (CD34+ CD133+ CD31+) readily internalized PFC nanoparticles without aid of adjunctive labeling techniques, and cells remained functional in vivo. PFC-labeled cells exhibited distinct 19F signals and were readily detected after both local and intravenous injection. PFC nanoparticles provide an unequivocal and unique signature for stem/progenitor cells, enable spatial cell localization with 19F MRI, and permit quantification and detection of multiple fluorine signatures via 19F MR spectroscopy. This method should facilitate longitudinal investigation of cellular events in vivo for multiple cell types simultaneously.",

To understand the effects of ACP feeding, different numbers of ACP [0 ACP (control), 5 ACP (low), 15–20 ACP (medium), and 25–30 ACP (high)] were allowed to feed on Citrus macrophylla greenhouse plants. After 7 days of feeding, leaves were collected and analyzed using 1H NMR. Metabolite concentrations from leaves of trees with ACP feeding had higher variability than control trees. Many metabolites were higher in concentration in the low ACP feeding group relative to control; however, leaves from trees with high ACP feeding had lower concentrations of many metabolites relative to control, including many amino acids such as phenylalanine, arginine, isoleucine, valine, threonine, and leucine. These results suggest ACP density-dependent changes in primary metabolism that can be measured by 1H NMR. The implications in plant defense are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A proton nuclear magnetic resonance study of the reaction of apohemoglobin A with both oxidized and reduced hemes reveals that at least two slowly interconverting species are initially formed, only one of which corresponds to the native proteins. Reconstitutions with isotope-labeled hemes reveal that the hyperfine-shift patterns for heme resonances in the metazido derivatives differ for the two species by interchange of heme environment characteristic of heme orientational disorder about the alpha, gamma-meso axis, as previously demonstrated for myoglobin [La Mar, G. N., Davis, N. L., Parish, D. W., & Smith, K. M. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 168, 887-896]. Careful scrutiny of the 1H NMR spectrum of freshly prepared hemoglobin A (Hb A) reveals that characteristic resonances for the alternate heme orientation are present in both subunits, clearly demonstrating that \"native\" Hb A possesses an important structure heterogeneity. It is observed that this heterogeneity disappears with time for one subunit but remains unchanged in the other. This implies that a metastable disordered state in vivo involves the alpha subunit and an equilibrium disordered state both in vivo and in vitro is involved within the beta subunit. The presence of metastable disorder in fresh blood suggests an in vivo hemoglobin assembly from apoprotein and heme that is similar to the in vitro reconstitution process. The slow equilibration and known lifetimes for erythrocytes provide a rationalization for the presence of detectable metastable states. The implications of such heme disorder for Hb function are discussed.",

In this study, we have used 1H NMR spectroscopy to compare the binding of this inhibitory TnI peptide to a synthetic peptide heterodimer representing site III and site IV of the C-terminal domain of troponin C (TnC) and to calcium-saturated skeletal TnC. The residues whose 1H NMR chemical shifts are perturbed upon TnIp binding are the same in both the site III/site IV heterodimer and TnC. These residues include F102, I104, F112, I113, I121, I149, D150, F151, and F154, which are all found in the C-terminal domain hydrophobic pocket and antiparallel beta-sheet region of the synthetic site III/site IV heterodimer and of TnC. Further, the affinity of TnIp binding to the heterodimer (Kd = 192 +/- 37 microM) was found to be similar to TnIp binding to TnC (48 +/- 18 microM [Campbell, A.P., Cachia, P.J., & Sykes, B.D., 1991, Biochem. Cell Biol. 69, 674-681]). The results indicate that binding of the inhibitory region of TnI is primarily to the C-terminal domain of TnC. The results also indicate how well the synthetic peptide heterodimer mimics the C-terminal domain of TnC in structure and functional interactions.",

The method employs selective DANTE pulses, which avoid exciting the water signal and at the same time control the J modulation effect in the homonuclear spin-echo experiment. By difference spectroscopy, we have suppressed the background signals from lipids and water and have resolved the CH3 resonance of lactate at 1.33 ppm. Moreover, the technique is highly selective and allows us to select the CH3 resonance of alanine at 1.47 ppm in the presence of the CH3 resonance of lactate at 1.33 ppm, even though the latter was much larger before editing. We have applied this technique to study the metabolic effect of ethanol in perfused mouse liver and have observed that the rate of formation of lactate from pyruvate is increased by a factor of 2.8 when ethanol is added.",

The meat quality and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics of breast meat from Pekin and Linwu ducks at 2 different ages (42 and 72d) was analyzed. The results showed that age exerted a greater effect on the observed meat quality traits of breast meat than breed, and its interaction (breed × age) effect on pH values and yellowness (b*) of duck breast meat was significant. Total of 32 metabolites were detected in breast meat of Pekin and Linwu duck. The difference of metabolite profiles in breast meat between Pekin and Linwu duck at 72 d was greater than that at 42 d, while the effects of age on metabolites of duck meat from both breeds were similar. Anserine, aspartate, and carnosine were the most relevant metabolites of duck breast meat quality, and nicotinamide in duck breast meat was negatively correlated with cooking loss. ﻿These results provide an overall perspective for bridging the gap between the breed and age on duck meat quality and metabolome, and improve the understanding of the relationship between metabolites and duck meat quality.",

    "abstract": "Key questions on how intertidal animals adapt to hypoxic stress center on the high energy phosphate response to decreasing oxygenation. With recent 1H/31P-NMR techniques to monitor mammalian tissue metabolism, a novel approach has emerged to observe potentially the intracellular oxygen interaction in invertebrates. The present study indicates that Arenicola marina, a standard model for intertidal animals, exhibits a distinct set of Mb 1H-NMR signals in vivo, corresponding to the two isolated Mb isoforms. Specifically both deoxy-Mb I and deoxy-Mb II exhibit paramagnetically shifted signals at 93.4 ppm and 92.5 ppm at 25 degrees C, respectively, which arise from the proximal histidyl NdeltaH. These signals reflect the cellular oxygenation state and indicate clearly that the phosphotaurocyamine level begins to drop at the onset of anoxia and declines gradually to 50% of control after 3.5 h. 1H Mb spectra indicate protein heterogeneity originating from heme as well as structural disorder.",

The signal appears in a clear spectral region of the 1H spectrum and is sensitive to various hypoxic and ischemic conditions. In perfused heart, the deoxymyoglobin's response to tissue oxygenation precedes the one reflected in the 31P phosphocreatine or ATP signals, suggesting that oxidative energy metabolism is still sufficient even when the myoglobin is partially saturated with oxygen.

    "abstract": "Sclerostin, the SOST gene product, is a negative regulator of bone formation and a positive regulator of bone resorption. In this study, treatment of human primary osteoblasts, including cells differentiated to an osteocyte-like stage, with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25D) resulted in the dose-dependent increased expression of SOST mRNA. A similar effect was observed in human trabecular bone samples cultured ex vivo, and in osteocyte-like cultures of differentiated SAOS2 cells. Treatment of SAOS2 cells with 1,25D resulted in the production and secretion of sclerostin protein. In silico analysis of the human SOST gene revealed a single putative DR3-type vitamin D response element (VDRE) at position -6216 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). This sequence was confirmed to have strong VDRE activity by luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA). Sequence substitution in the VDR/RXR half-sites abolished VDRE reporter activity and binding of nuclear proteins. A 6.3 kb fragment of the human proximal SOST promoter demonstrated responsiveness to 1,25D. The addition of the evolutionary conserved region 5 (ECR5), a known bone specific enhancer region, ahead of the 6.3 kb fragment increased basal promoter activity but did not increase 1,25D responsiveness. Site-specific mutagenesis abolished the responsiveness of the 6.3 kb promoter to 1,25D. We conclude that 1,25D is a direct regulator of human SOST gene and sclerostin protein expression, extending the pathways of control of sclerostin expression. At least some of this responsiveness is mediated by the identified classical VDRE however the nature of the transcriptional regulation by 1,25D warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Vit-D) limits its topical use despite its profound effects on cellular differentiation, proliferation, and immunomodulation. Therefore, in search for a more effective analog of Vit-D, in this study we have evaluated the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-3-bromoacetate (BE). Proliferation and apoptosis studies in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were conducted by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), CFSE (carboxy fluorescein succinimidyl ester) dilution, and Annexin V assays. Western blot analysis and real-time PCR were performed to determine its effect on signal transduction. A reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model was used to further validate the therapeutic role of BE in psoriasis. BE was significantly more potent than an equivalent concentration of Vit-D in inhibiting growth and survival of human keratinocytes. The antimitotic effect was found to be due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) and its downstream target, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In the RHE model, BE reversed IL-22-induced psoriasiform changes more effectively than Vit-D. Interestingly, BE inhibited the IL-22-induced gene expression of AKT1, MTOR, chemokines [IL-8 and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted)], and psoriasin (S100A7) more significantly than Vit-D. These results suggest the potential of BE as a prospective therapeutic agent for psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic organic chemists have a large toolbox of named reactions to form structural motifs through a retrosynthetic approach when targeting a complex molecule. On the other hand, a comparatively complex inorganic compound may be made through simple mechanochemical reactions of the elements followed by annealing. For complex phases that involve more than two elements, the simple mechanochemical process can be complex with many competing phases, which can negatively impact desired properties. This point has been made recently with a revelation of improved properties of thermoelectric materials upon the removal of impurities. Compounds of the Yb14AlSb11 structure type represent complex Zintl phases with exceptional high-temperature thermoelectric properties but are difficult to prepare in high purity. In this work, a quenching study was used to elucidate the pathway taken by reactions from the elements to form the complex ternary phase, Yb14AlSb11. Through that study, two Yb-Sb binary phases, Yb11Sb10 and Yb4Sb3, were identified as intermediates in the reaction. These two Yb-Sb binaries were investigated for use as reactive precursors to form Yb14MnSb11 in reactions with MnSb. Through this pseudoretrosynthetic approach, reactions from Yb4Sb3 allowed for the synthesis of high-purity Yb14MnSb11 and Yb14MgSb11 through balanced, stoichiometric reactions. The apparent Yb2O3 (∼1%) impurity found in these products was systematically reduced with x in the series Yb14-xMnSb11 (x = 0-0.05), suggesting that the main phase is inherently Yb-deficient and showing the high degree of control obtained through this synthetic approach. The stoichiometric sample of Yb14MgSb11 has a peak zT of 1.3 at 1175 K, and the stoichiometric sample of Yb14MnSb11 has a peak zT of 1.2 at 1275 K. This approach to solid-state synthesis provides reproducible products from balanced stoichiometric reactants to form high-purity complex structure types and can be adapted to other difficult ternary systems.",

    "abstract": "This chapter discusses the genetic and the molecular analysis of leaf development. The pattern of successive leaves on a meristem, called phyllotaxis, has provided experimental systems for the studies of whole-plant pattern formation. Within the leaf itself, bilateral symmetry, precise and orderly vascular differentiation, and stomata1 patterns within the leaf epidermis all exemplify patterned differentiation. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the complex process of pattern generation in plants. The two most prominent hypotheses state: that the genetic mechanisms operate at supracellular levels to generate form and that the patterns are progressively determined in a “differentiation-dependent” manner. Plants often express a heteroblastic variation in leaf shape and size on the axis. It is, therefore, important in developmental studies to have designations for specific leaves. Leaf shape can be studied, by combining the morphological analysis with genetic clonal analysis, utilizing the somatically marked cells and the cellular site of gene action can be elucidated, by combining the clonal analysis with mutational analysis in studies of interactions between mutant and wild-type cells. © 1993, Academic Press Inc.",

Perchloric acid extraction and deproteinization of this fraction permitted subsequent analysis of nucleotide identity and content by high performance liquid chromatography. PC12 cells grown in the absence of nerve growth factor (NGF) contained ADP, ATP, GDP, and GTP at levels consistent with the actin and tubulin content of the cytoskeletal fraction. Microtubules from PC12 cells cultured in the presence of NGF contain an additional nucleotide that we have identified as dGTP. Analysis of whole cell nucleotide extracts from PC12 cells grown in the absence or presence of NGF revealed no evidence for the presence of dGTP at 4 and 14 days, respectively. We have determined that embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion neurons also contain this deoxyribonucleotide, and we found virtually no ADP or ATP in the extracted dorsal root ganglion cytoskeletal fraction. On the basis of metabolic labeling studies with [14C] guanine, we have inferred that the presence of dGTP in NGF-treated PC12 cells probably arises either from binding to the nonexchangeable nucleotide site of tubulin undergoing dynamic assembly/disassembly or from binding to the exchangeable site of tubulin subsequently incorporated into highly stabilized microtubules.",

The hydantoins are excellent substrates for the NEIL glycosylases in a variety of DNA contexts beyond canonical duplex DNA, implicating the potential impact of repair activity on a multitude of cellular processes. In order to prepare stable derivatives as chemical biology tools, oligonucleotides containing fluorine at the 2'-position of the sugar of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine2'-F-OG) were synthesized in ribo and arabino configuration. Selective oxidation of 2'-F-OG within a DNA oligonucleotide provided the corresponding 2'-F-Gh or 2'-F-Sp containing DNA. The 2'-F-hydantoins in duplex DNA were found to be highly resistant to the glycosylase activity of Fpg and NEIL1 compared to the unmodified lesion substrates. Surprisingly, however, some glycosylase-mediated base removal from both the 2'-F-ribo- and 2'-F-arabinohydantoin duplex DNA was observed. Notably, the associated β-lyase strand scission reaction of the 2'-F-arabinohydantoins was inhibited such that the glycosylases were \"stalled\" at the Schiff-base intermediate. Fpg and NEIL1 showed high affinity for the 2'-F-Gh duplexes in both ribo and arabino configurations. However, binding affinity assessed using catalytically inactive variants of Fpg and NEIL1 indicated higher affinity for the 2'-F-riboGh-containing duplexes. The distinct features of glycosylase processing of 2'-F-ribohydantoins and 2'-F-arabinohydantoins illustrate their utility to reveal structural insight into damage recognition and excision by NEIL and related glycosylases and provide opportunities for delineating the impact of lesion formation and repair in cells.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by fat accumulation, chronic inflammation and impaired satiety signaling, which may be due in part to gut microbial dysbiosis. Manipulations of the gut microbiota and its metabolites are attractive targets for obesity treatment. The predominant oligosaccharide found in human milk, acts as a prebiotic with beneficial effects on the host. However, little is known about the beneficial effects of 2'-FL in obesity. The aim of this study was to determine the beneficial effects of 2'-FL supplementation on the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the diet-induced obese phenotype in high fat (HF)-fed mice. Male C57/BL6 mice (n = 6/group; six weeks old) were counter-balanced into six weight-matched groups and fed either a low-fat (LF; 10% kcal as fat), HF (45% kcal as fat) or HF diet with 2'-FL (HF_2'-FL) at 1, 2, 5 and 10% (w/v) in drinking water for six weeks. General phenotypes (body weight, energy intake, fat and lean mass), cecal microbiome and metabolites, gut-brain signaling, intestinal permeability and inflammatory and lipid profiles were assessed. Only 10% 2'-FL, but not 1, 2 or 5%, decreased HF diet-induced increases in energy intake, fat mass and body weight gain. A supplementation of 10% 2'-FL changed the composition of cecal microbiota and metabolites compared to LF- and HF-fed mice with an increase in Parabacteroides abundance and lactate and pyruvate, respectively, whose metabolic effects corresponded to our study findings. In particular, 10% 2'-FL significantly reversed the HF diet-induced impairment of cholecystokinin-induced inhibition of food intake. Gene expressions of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 in the cecum were significantly downregulated by 10% 2'-FL compared to the HF group. Furthermore, 10% 2'-FL suppressed HF diet-induced upregulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, a transcription factor for adipogenesis, at the gene level. In conclusion, 10% 2'-FL led to compositional changes in gut microbiota and metabolites associated with improvements in metabolic profiles and gut-brain signaling in HF-fed mice. These findings support the use of 2'-FL for modulating the hyperphagic response to HF diets and improving the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

Similar aromatic compounds that do not induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (pyrene, dibenzofuran) did not exhibit this suppressive effect. The concentration dependence on TCDD for induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase was nearly identical to that for its suppression of transglutaminase induction, with half-maximal effects observed at approximately 20 pM in each instance. Similarly, the concentrations of 3-MC giving half-maximal stimulation of the hydroxylase and suppression of the transglutaminase were comparable (0.9 and 0.3 microM, respectively), although this agent was almost five orders of magnitude less potent than TCDD.

A toxicity increase was also evident in the several-fold stimulation by TCDD of protein and DNA adducts formed by Trp-P-1. In contrast, the cells were insensitive to toxicity from 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole. DNA damage mediated by Trp-P-1 was capable of producing inheritable effects, as judged by the induction of hprt mutants in a TCDD-stimulated fashion.

In marine environments, TBP is incorporated into shellfish and consumed by predatory fish. Food processing and water treatment facilities produce TBP as a byproduct. 2,4,6-Tribromophenol has been detected in human blood and breast milk. Biologically, TBP interferes with estrogen and thyroid hormone signaling, which regulate important transporters of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a selectively permeable barrier characterized by brain microvessels which are composed of endothelial cells mortared by tight-junction proteins. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters on the luminal membrane facilitate the removal of unwanted endobiotics and xenobiotics from the brain. In this study, we examined the in vivo and ex vivo effects of TBP on two important transporters of the BBB: P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2), using male and female rats and mice. 2,4,6-Tribromophenol exposure ex vivo resulted in a time- (1-3 h) and dose- (1-100 nM) dependent decrease in P-gp transport activity. MRP2 transport activity was unchanged under identical conditions. Immunofluorescence and western blotting measured decreases in P-gp expression after TBP treatment. ATPase assays indicate that TBP is not a substrate and does not directly interact with P-gp. In vivo dosing with TBP (0.4 µmol/kg) produced decreases in P-gp transport. Co-treatment with selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors prevented the TBP-mediated decreases in P-gp transport activity.",

A previous meta-analysis found no clear association overall but did not specifically examine high-exposure groups. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies of the associations between 2,4-D and NHL, with a particular focus on high-exposure groups, and evaluations of heterogeneity, dose-response, and bias. A total of 12 observational studies, 11 case-control studies, and one cohort study, were included. The summary relative risk for NHL using study results comparing subjects who were ever versus never exposed to 2,4-D was 1.38 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.77). However, in analyses focusing on results from highly exposed groups, the summary relative risk for NHL was 1.73 (95% CI, 1.10-2.72). No clear bias based on study design, exposure assessment methodology, or outcome misclassification was seen. Overall, these findings provide new evidence for an association between NHL and exposure to the herbicide 2,4-D.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a common surgery to treat cervical degenerative disc disease. Use of an anterior spacer and plate system (ASPS) results in increased disc height, higher fusion rate, lower subsidence rate, and lower complication rate than a spacer alone.1,2 However, anterior cervical plating is associated with complications, such as dysphagia, plate-screw dislodgment, soft tissue injury, neural injury, and esophageal perforation.3-9 To potentially reduce these drawbacks, integrated spacer and plate (ISP) systems have gained popularity. METHODS: From November 2009 to October 2013, a total of 84 consecutive patients who underwent 2-level ACDF using ISP or ASPS were reviewed for clinical and radiographic outcomes. Patient-reported visual analog scale (VAS) and Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores, fusion rates, and hardware failure were determined at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. RESULTS: Forty-three patients received ISP and 41 patients received ASPS. There were no significant differences in patient demographics between the 2 groups. Perioperative characteristics were similar, except for operative time. Postoperatively, no significant differences in VAS or NDI scores or fusion status were found. At the proximal surgical level only, there was a trend toward an earlier observed radiographic fusion rate in ASPS vs ISP, but this finding was not statistically significant (P = 0.092). One case of long-term dysphagia was reported in each group. Neither group had implant failures up to 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: The ISP system for 2-level ACDF compared to traditional ASPS has comparable clinical and radiographic outcomes up to 2 years postoperatively. There may be a trend toward an earlier observed radiographic fusion in the ASPS group, but there was no difference in long-term dysphagia rate. CLINICAL RELAVANCE: Integrated spacer and traditional anterior spacer for 2-level ACDF has similar clinical and radiographical outcome.",

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) develop a procedure using headspace solid phase micro-extraction combined with GC-MS in the selected ion monitoring mode (HS-SPME-GC-MS-SIM) for analysis of MIBP in grape berries, and (2) determine the location of MIBP biosynthesis in grapevines by approach grafting clusters of Vitis vinifera L. cvs Cabernet Sauvignon and Muscat blanc onto each other. The soluble solids and pH of the grape juice/homogenate matrix from different grape berry developmental stages influenced the method precision; therefore, quantification via the method of standard addition was used. Using our developed method, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of MIBP were 0.1 ng L(-1) and 2 ng L(-1), respectively, measured in a model juice and non-MIBP containing Chardonnay juice. Spiked recoveries averaged between 91% and 112% in Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir homogenates and the overall relative standard deviation was less than 10%. The method was used to analyze MIBP in 29 grape cultivars and in fruit from clusters grafted to Cabernet Sauvignon or Muscat vines. Quantifiable levels were found only in Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc and Semillon, providing information on the genetic connection for the occurrence of MIBP in grapes. No MIBP was detected in the berries of Muscat blanc clusters grafted onto Cabernet Sauvignon vines when sampled at fruit maturity. MIBP was detected in all berries of Cabernet Sauvignon regardless the graft configuration. The data indicate that MIBP or its precursors originate in the berry and its formation depends upon grape genotype.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) remains fatal despite all available therapies. Initial treatment with conventional drugs such as, Dexamethasone (Dex) effectively induces MM cell death; however, prolonged drug exposures results in the development of chemoresistance. Our prior study demonstrated that 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) induces apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells resistant to Dexamethasone (Dex). Here, we show the mechanism whereby 2ME2 overcomes Dex-resistance. The oligonucleotide array analysis demonstrates that Heat Shock Protein-27 (Hsp27) is upregulated in Dex-resistant, but not in Dex-sensitive MM cells. Proteomics analysis of Hsp27-immunocomplexes revealed the presence of actin in Dex-resistant, but not in Dex-sensitive cells. Biochemical interaction between Hsp27 and actin was examined by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Hsp27 or actin Abs. Far western blot analysis using GST-Hsp27 fusion protein showed a direct association with actin both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, 2ME2- or Bortezomib/Proteasome inhibitor (PS-341)-induced apoptosis in Dex-resistant MM cell lines and MM patient cells is associated with disruption of the Hsp27-actin complexes. Finally, blockade of Hsp27 by anti-sense strategy enhanced anti-MM activity of both 2ME2 and PS-341. These findings provide the clinical application of novel therapeutics targeting Hsp27 to improve patient outcome in MM.",

    "abstract": "The effect of a ketogenic diet (KD) on middle aged female mice is poorly understood as most of this work have been conducted in young female mice or diseased models. We have previously shown that an isocaloric KD started at middle age in male mice results in enhanced mitochondrial mass and function after 2 months on diet and improved cognitive behavior after being on diet for 14 months when compared with their control diet (CD) fed counterparts. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of an isocaloric 2-month KD or CD on healthy 14-month-old female mice. At 16 months of age cognitive behavior tests were performed and then serum, skeletal muscle, cortex, and hippocampal tissues were collected for biochemical analysis. Two months on a KD resulted in enhanced cognitive behavior associated with anxiety, memory, and willingness to explore. The improved neurocognitive function was associated with increased PGC1α protein in the gastrocnemius (GTN) muscle and nuclear fraction. The KD resulted in a tissue specific increase in mitochondrial mass and kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) levels in the GTN and soleus muscles, with a corresponding decrease in kynurenine and increase in kynurenic acid levels in serum. With KAT proteins being responsible for converting kynurenine into kynurenic acid, which is unable to cross the blood brain barrier and be turned into quinolinic acid-a potent neurotoxin, this study provides a potential mechanism of crosstalk between muscle and brain in mice on a KD that may contribute to improved cognitive function in middle-aged female mice.",

Although 2NB has been used in a number of solution and ice experiments in the laboratory, the quantum efficiencies and molar absorptivities of 2NB have not been critically evaluated, especially on ice. Using a series of laboratory and field measurements we have measured the light absorbance and photochemical properties of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde in solution (water and/or acetonitrile) and in/on water ice. Our results show that the molar absorptivities of 2NB are only weakly dependent upon temperature and that the quantum yield is independent of temperature in water; the quantum yield is also independent of wavelength, as shown by past reports. Furthermore, we find that the photochemistry of 2NB in/on water ice is the same as in liquid water. While most studies employing 2NB cite and use a quantum yield of 0.50, based on a review of the literature, and on our new experimental data, we recommend a quantum yield of 0.41 for 2NB photolysis for both solution and water ice. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "In vivo pharmacological inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) reduces inflammatory diseases, including acute pancreatitis (AP). Adamantyl ureas are very potent sEH inhibitors, but the lipophilicity and metabolism of the adamantane group compromise their overall usefulness. Herein, we report that the replacement of a methylene unit of the adamantane group by an oxygen atom increases the solubility, permeability, and stability of three series of urea-based sEH inhibitors. Most of these oxa-analogues are nanomolar inhibitors of both the human and murine sEH. Molecular dynamics simulations rationalize the molecular basis for their activity and suggest that the presence of the oxygen atom on the adamantane scaffold results in active site rearrangements to establish a weak hydrogen bond. The 2-oxaadamantane 22, which has a good solubility, microsomal stability, and selectivity for sEH, was selected for further in vitro and in vivo studies in models of cerulein-induced AP. Both in prophylactic and treatment studies, 22 diminished the overexpression of inflammatory and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers induced by cerulein and reduced the pancreatic damage.",

Cognitive status ranged from normal to demented and AD neuropathology ranged from none to severe. Confirmatory factor analysis identified a best-fitting 4-factor solution to describe interrelationships among plaques and tangles: a global neuritic plaque factor; a global diffuse plaque factor; a factor defined by medial temporal neurofibrillary tangles; and a neocortical tangle factor. Results supported a hypothesis that neuritic plaques mediate the association of age and APOE with neocortical tangles, and similarly mediate the effect of APOE on medial temporal tangles. However, medial temporal tangles were related to age independent of neuritic plaques. These results support a primary amyloid-based AD process that accounts for neocortical tangles and makes the largest contribution to medial temporal tangles. A second, age-related but non-amyloid process likely contributes to medial temporal lobe tangles.",

    "abstract": "Arctic tundra vegetation communities are spatially heterogeneous and may vary dramatically from one meter to the next. Consequently, representing Arctic tundra vegetation communities accurately requires very high resolution raster maps (<5 m grid cell size). However, using remotely sensed data to produce maps with sufficient spatial detail at an extent appropriate for understanding landscape-scale ecological patterns is challenging. In this study, we used predictor layers derived from airborne lidar and high-resolution (∼5 cm) 4-band airborne imagery to classify vegetation communities at 20 cm spatial resolution for three landscapes (12.5 km2 total) near the Toolik Lake research area in the Alaskan Low Arctic. The maps were built using a Random Forest model that was trained and tested on 800 ground reference plots, using classes derived from commonly used legends on existing polygon maps of the area. Withheld test plots (25% of dataset) had a balanced map accuracy of 0.57, kappa of 0.47, and weighted (fuzzy) kappa of 0.65. These maps provide high-resolution plant community information that can serve as important baseline reference data for vegetation monitoring and change detection in this rapidly changing tundra ecosystem, and as validation for coarser scale maps. They also permit fine-scale characterization of landscape phenomena such as community-level nutrient dynamics and wildlife habitat suitability in an important Arctic research site. Our approach demonstrates that very high resolution mapping results can be achieved and validated by integrating high-resolution remote-sensing datasets from multiple sensors in a machine learning model trained on simple field reference data.",

OBJECTIVES: Catalogue published applications and indications for noncardiac therapeutic IR/IE in animals and describe type and quality of veterinary IR/IE research over 20 years. METHODS: Highly-cited veterinary journals were searched to identify articles published 2000 to 2019 involving therapeutic IR/IE applications for clinical veterinary patients. Articles were assigned a level of evidence (LOE) according to published standards. Authorship, animal data, study design, and interventions were described. Change in publication rate, study size, and LOE of IR/IE articles over time was analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-nine of 15 512 (1%) articles were eligible, including 2972 animals. All studies were low LOE and 43% were case reports with ≤5 animals. Number of IR/IE articles per year (P < .001), proportion of journals' articles pertaining to IR/IE (P = .02), and study size (P = .04) all increased over time, but LOE (P = .07) did not. Common target body systems were urinary (40%), digestive (23%) respiratory (20%), and vascular (13%). Common indications were nonvascular luminal obstructions (47%), object retrieval (14%), and congenital anomalies (13%). Most procedures involved indwelling medical devices or embolic agents, whereas tissue resection and other procedures were less common. Procedures utilized fluoroscopy (43%), endoscopy (33%), ultrasound (8%), digital radiography (1%), or fluoroscopy in combination with other modalities (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatments involving IR/IE have wide applicability in veterinary medicine but large, rigorous, and comparative studies describing these procedures are lacking.",

This is the frequency range where matching loss becomes comparable with the gain of the amp-cell in most silicon technologies. By deriving power equations of embedded amp-cell, power contours are plotted in the gain plane and an optimum embedding is designed to maximize the output power for a desired gain. To showcase the theory, a high-frequency, high-power amp-cell, called matched cascode, is introduced and subsequently embedded to boost both power gain and output power.

Clinical signs of leptospirosis in dogs relate to development of renal disease, hepatic disease, uveitis, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Disease may follow periods of high rainfall, and can occur in dogs roaming in proximity to water sources, farm animals, or wildlife, or dogs residing in suburban environments. Diagnosis is based on acute and convalescent phase antibody titers by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), with or without use of polymerase chain reaction assays. There is considerable interlaboratory variation in MAT results, and the MAT does not accurately predict the infecting serogroup. The recommended treatment for optimal clearance of the organism from renal tubules is doxycycline, 5 mg/kg p.o. q12h, for 14 days. Annual vaccination can prevent leptospirosis caused by serovars included in the vaccine and is recommended for dogs at risk of infection.",

Professor Annabeth Rosen served as director of graduate studies for this class.The catalogue design is by Rudy Garibay of the Arts Administrative Group, veteran designer for campus publications in Music and Theatre and more recently the California Lighting Technology Center at UCD.I am especially pleased that the electronic version of the catalogue will represent our inaugural deposition to the University of California's eScholarship project at the California Digital Library. Visit www.escholarship.org/uc/aah.Additionally we are very grateful to the entire staff of the Nelson Gallery: Renny Pritikin, director; Katrina Wong, assistant to the director and designer of the promotional materials; Robin Bernhard, collection manager; and Kyle Monhollen, senior preparator; to the staff of the Pence Gallery: Natalie Nelson, director; Eileen Hendren, office manager; to the musicians for Robert Machoian's work, led by Richard Chowenhill of the Department of Music; and, always, to the donors whose generosity to the Department of Art and Art History has resulted in the endowments that enable our program to attract and support artists of the caliber presented here: family of Robert Arneson, Marcia Cary, Freemon Gadberry, Richard and Fay Nelson, Mary Lou Osborne, Wayne Thiebaud and family, and Nettie Weber.D.

    "abstract": "Conventional descriptive analysis (DA) has been widely applied to describe the sensory characteristics of products. An analysis of the scientific literature was performed to better understand the context in which descriptive methods are utilized. When DA is used in methodological research, either to test the method itself, or to compare to new methods, is that representative of its use in application studies aiming at obtaining sensory descriptions? Web of Science was queried using “sensory profile” and “descriptive analysis” as search terms from 2010 to 2015. For each generated result, the following metadata were extracted: number and type of products, number of panelists, training and evaluation methods, and data analysis. The data were analyzed according to the goals of the study (using or developing sensory methods) and type of journal publishing the article (sensory specific journal or other). Out of 360 selected entries using DA, 20 used DA in conjunction with rapid methods, and 5 with temporal methods. 93% of DA experiments were used to obtain information about products in non-sensory specific journals. Alcoholic beverages, produce, and dairy were the top 3 categories assessed. Some product categories, such as starches and condiments/oil were only represented in application studies. Some results thus suggest a discrepancy in context between experiments designed to test methodological aspects of DA or new methods, or to obtain sensory information. Context of use should be considered when testing new methods.",

    "abstract": "Questions concerning longitudinal data quality and reproducibility of proteomic laboratories spurred the Protein Research Group of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF-PRG) to design a study to systematically assess the reproducibility of proteomic laboratories over an extended period of time. Developed as an open study, initially 64 participants were recruited from the broader mass spectrometry community to analyze provided aliquots of a six bovine protein tryptic digest mixture every month for a period of nine months. Data were uploaded to a central repository, and the operators answered an accompanying survey. Ultimately, 45 laboratories submitted a minimum of eight LC-MSMS raw data files collected in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. No standard operating procedures were enforced; rather the participants were encouraged to analyze the samples according to usual practices in the laboratory. Unlike previous studies, this investigation was not designed to compare laboratories or instrument configuration, but rather to assess the temporal intralaboratory reproducibility. The outcome of the study was reassuring with 80% of the participating laboratories performing analyses at a medium to high level of reproducibility and quality over the 9-month period. For the groups that had one or more outlying experiments, the major contributing factor that correlated to the survey data was the performance of preventative maintenance prior to the LC-MSMS analyses. Thus, the Protein Research Group of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities recommends that laboratories closely scrutinize the quality control data following such events. Additionally, improved quality control recording is imperative. This longitudinal study provides evidence that mass spectrometry-based proteomics is reproducible. When quality control measures are strictly adhered to, such reproducibility is comparable among many disparate groups. Data from the study are available via ProteomeXchange under the accession code PXD002114.",

    "abstract": "Dr. Bernard Brodie's legacy is built on fundamental discoveries in pharmacology and drug metabolism that were then translated to the clinic to improve patient care. Similarly, the development of a novel class of therapeutics termed the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors was originally spurred by fundamental research exploring the biochemistry and physiology of the sEH. Here, we present an overview of the history and current state of research on epoxide hydrolases, specifically focusing on sEHs. In doing so, we start with the translational project studying the metabolism of the insect juvenile hormone mimic R-20458 [(E)-6,7-epoxy-1-(4-ethylphenoxy)-3,7-dimethyl-2-octene], which led to the identification of the mammalian sEH. Further investigation of this enzyme and its substrates, including the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, led to insight into mechanisms of inflammation, chronic and neuropathic pain, angiogenesis, and other physiologic processes. This basic knowledge in turn led to the development of potent inhibitors of the sEH that are promising therapeutics for pain, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, arthritis, and other disorders.",

    "abstract": "Twitter, a popular social media platform, has surfaced as a dominant political communication and campaign tool across Western democracies. However its role in politics, particularly in electoral campaigns, in economically developing democracies with low internet accessibility, is largely unknown. This study conducts an investigation of Twitter's use as a campaign tool during the 2014 Indian general elections, which was the country's first experiment with using social media for political campaigning. We present a multi-level manual and computer-aided analysis of 98,363 tweets posted by eleven political parties during the two-month run up to the elections, to present the topical, functional and interaction strategies of their Twitter campaigns. This analysis is complemented by a macro analysis of electoral outcomes' relationship with first-time voter population and internet accessibility information at the state level. Our findings suggest that the new-and-upcoming parties used Twitter for self-promotion and media validation, while established parties used it to supplement their offline strategies. It is also observed that the winning party's electoral success is significantly associated with their use of Twitter for engaging voters, the large population of first-time voters and levels of internet accessibility. The implications of these findings and the limitations of the study are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The initial study, ADNI-1, enrolled 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 with early AD, and 200 cognitively normal elderly controls. ADNI-1 was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and by a competitive renewal, ADNI-2, which enrolled an additional 550 participants and will run until 2015. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results to the end of 2013. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are largely consistent with disease trajectories predicted by β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimer's Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers select and combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, amyloid PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of blood biomarkers for AD as potentially noninvasive and low-cost alternatives to CSF biomarkers for AD diagnosis and the assessment of α-syn as an additional biomarker; (5) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (6) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Multimodal methods incorporating APOE status and longitudinal MRI proved most highly predictive of future decline. Refinements of clinical tests used as outcome measures such as clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes further reduced sample sizes; (7) the pioneering of genome-wide association studies that leverage quantitative imaging and biomarker phenotypes, including longitudinal data, to confirm recently identified loci, CR1, CLU, and PICALM and to identify novel AD risk loci; (8) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Japan, Australia, Argentina, Taiwan, China, Korea, Europe, and Italy; (9) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker and clinical data to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (10) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world.",

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of GIOP prevention and treatment options. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. We used a group consensus process to determine the final recommendations and grade their strength. The guideline addresses initial assessment and reassessment in patients beginning or continuing long-term (≥3 months) glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, as well as the relative benefits and harms of lifestyle modification and of calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab treatment in the general adult population receiving long-term GC treatment, as well as in special populations of long-term GC users. RESULTS: Because of limited evidence regarding the benefits and harms of interventions in GC users, most recommendations in this guideline are conditional (uncertain balance between benefits and harms). Recommendations include treating only with calcium and vitamin D in adults at low fracture risk, treating with calcium and vitamin D plus an additional osteoporosis medication (oral bisphosphonate preferred) in adults at moderate-to-high fracture risk, continuing calcium plus vitamin D but switching from an oral bisphosphonate to another antifracture medication in adults in whom oral bisphosphonate treatment is not appropriate, and continuing oral bisphosphonate treatment or switching to another antifracture medication in adults who complete a planned oral bisphosphonate regimen but continue to receive GC treatment. Recommendations for special populations, including children, people with organ transplants, women of childbearing potential, and people receiving very high-dose GC treatment, are also made. CONCLUSION: This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions. Clinicians and patients should use a shared decision-making process that accounts for patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A survey of California (CA) dairies was performed in spring 2018 to characterize antimicrobial stewardship practices, antimicrobial drug (AMD) use, and health management of adult cows on CA dairies since the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) and the CA Senate Bill 27 (SB 27). Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented regulatory changes requiring veterinary oversight for therapeutic uses of medically-important antimicrobial drugs (MIADs) administered in feed (VFD) and water (veterinary prescription). Similarly, effective January 1, 2018, the CA legislature enacted California Food and Agricultural Code (FAC) 14400-14408, formerly known as Senate Bill 27 (SB 27) requiring veterinary prescriptions for all other dosage forms of MIADs. METHODS: The questionnaire consisted of 43 questions partitioned into three sections to assess herd information, management practices, and AMD use and perspectives. The questionnaire was mailed to 1,282 grade A licensed dairies in CA and 149 responses (11.6%) were collected from 19 counties across the three defined regions of CA: Northern CA (NCA), Northern San Joaquin Valley (NSJV), and Greater Southern CA (GSCA). RESULTS: Most dairies reported treating all dry cows with intramammary AMD and/or teat sealant at the end of a lactation (87.2%). In 92.3% of dairies, producers relied on the veterinarian for information about AMD used to treat cows. Treatment duration for cows treated with AMD was based on the drug manufacturer's label and veterinarian's instructions in most dairies (98.6%). Most respondents to the survey confirmed having a valid veterinarian-client-patient-relationship (VCPR) for their dairies (91.7%), participated in animal welfare audit programs (81.8%) and dairy quality assurance programs (52.9%). Approximately 98.6% respondents were aware that all uses of MIADs in livestock required a veterinary feed directive (VFD) or prescription and are no longer sold over-the-counter (OTC) in CA since January 1, 2018. Multiple factor analysis (MFA) was performed and identified seven components composed of 21 variables (questions) that explained 99.7% of the total variance in the data. Hierarchical cluster analysis on the principal coordinates of the MFA based on conventional dairy survey responses identified two clusters characterized as large conventional dairies (median herd size: 1,265 cows) and mid-sized conventional dairies (median herd size: 715 cows) mostly in GSCA and NSJV. The organic dairies grouped into a single cluster of median herd size of 325 cows mostly in NCA. CONCLUSIONS: The survey results contribute to the knowledge of AMD use and antimicrobial stewardship practices on CA dairies since the implementation of the SB 27 and VFD laws and provide useful information for future evaluation of resistance-related risk in adult cows.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial drugs (AMD) are critical for the treatment, control, and prevention of diseases in humans and food-animals. Good AMD stewardship practices and judicious use of AMD are beneficial to the preservation of animal and human health from antimicrobial resistance threat. This study reports on changes in AMD use and stewardship practices on California (CA) dairies, following the implementation of CA Senate Bill 27 (SB 27; codified as Food and Agricultural Code, FAC 14400-14408; here onward referred to as SB 27), by modeling the associations between management practices on CA conventional dairies and seven outcome variables relating to AMD use and stewardship practices following SB 27. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was mailed to 1,282 grade A licensed dairies in CA in spring of 2018. Responses from 132 conventional dairies from 16 counties were included for analyses. Multivariate logistic regression models were specified to explore the associations between survey factors and six outcome variables: producers' familiarity with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA), Silver Spring, WA, USA medically important antimicrobial drugs (MIAD) term; change in over-the-counter (OTC) AMD use; initiation or increased use of alternatives to AMD; changes to prevent disease outbreaks; changes in AMD costs; and better animal health post SB 27. We employed machine learning classification models to determine which of the survey factors were the most important predictors of good-excellent AMD stewardship practices of CA conventional dairy producers. RESULTS: Having a valid veterinary-client-patient-relationship, involving a veterinarian in training employees on treatment protocols and decisions on AMDs used to treat sick cows, tracking milk and/or meat withdrawal intervals for treated cows, and participating in dairy quality assurance programs were positively associated with producers' familiarity with MIADs. Use or increased use of alternatives to AMDs since 2018 was associated with decreased use of AMDs that were previously available OTC prior to SB 27. Important variables associated with good-excellent AMD stewardship knowledge by CA conventional dairy producers included having written or computerized animal health protocols, keeping a drug inventory log, awareness that use of MIADs required a prescription following implementation of SB 27, involving a veterinarian in AMD treatment duration determination, and using selective dry cow treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified management factors associated with reported AMD use and antimicrobial stewardship practices on conventional dairies in CA within a year from implementation of SB 27. Producers will benefit from extension outreach efforts that incorporate the findings of this survey by further highlighting the significance of these management practices and encouraging those that are associated with judicious AMD use and stewardship practices on CA conventional dairies.",

The Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities conducted a large interlaboratory study to evaluate DIA performance in proteomics laboratories with various instrumentation. Participants were supplied with generic methods and a uniform set of test samples. The resulting 49 DIA datasets act as benchmarks and have utility in education and tool development. The sample set consisted of a tryptic HeLa digest spiked with high or low levels of 4 exogenous proteins. Data are available in MassIVE MSV000086479. Additionally, we demonstrate how the data can be analyzed by focusing on 2 datasets using different library approaches and show the utility of select summary statistics. These data can be used by DIA newcomers, software developers, or DIA experts evaluating performance with different platforms, acquisition settings, and skill levels.",

Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemics.",

In January 2018, California (CA) implemented legislation (Senate Bill 27; SB 27) requiring veterinary prescriptions for medically important AMD use in food animals. The objective of our survey was to characterize AMD use, health management, and AMD stewardship practices of adult cows on CA dairies since the implementation of SB 27. In 2019, we mailed a questionnaire to 1282 California dairies. We received a total of 131 (10.2%) survey responses from 19 counties in CA. Our results showed that 45.6% of respondents included a veterinarian in their decision on which injectable AMD to purchase. Additionally, 48.8% of dairy producers included a veterinarian in their decision on which AMDs were used to treat sick cows. The majority (96.8%) of dairy producers were aware that all uses of medically important AMDs require a prescription. Approximately 49% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that AMD use in livestock does not cause problems in humans. The survey documents antimicrobial use and stewardship practices in CA's dairy industry and focus areas for future research and education.",

The Neonatal Life Support Task Force generally determined by consensus the type of evidence evaluation to perform; the topics for the evidence updates followed consultation with International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation member resuscitation councils. The 2020 CoSTRs for neonatal life support are published either as new statements or, if appropriate, reiterations of existing statements when the task force found they remained valid.Evidence review topics of particular interest include the use of suction in the presence of both clear and meconium-stained amniotic fluid, sustained inflations for initiation of positive-pressure ventilation, initial oxygen concentrations for initiation of resuscitation in both preterm and term infants, use of epinephrine (adrenaline) when ventilation and compressions fail to stabilize the newborn infant, appropriate routes of drug delivery during resuscitation, and consideration of when it is appropriate to redirect resuscitation efforts after significant efforts have failed.All sections of the Neonatal Resuscitation Algorithm are addressed, from preparation through to postresuscitation care. This document now forms the basis for ongoing evidence evaluation and reevaluation, which will be triggered as further evidence is published.Over 140 million babies are born annually worldwide (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/births-and-deaths-projected-to-2100). If up to 5% receive positive-pressure ventilation, this evidence evaluation is relevant to more than 7 million newborn infants every year. However, in terms of early care of the newborn infant, some of the topics addressed are relevant to every single baby born.",

    "abstract": "Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) offers several advantages over alternative irrigation systems when it is designed and installed correctly and when best management practices are adopted. These advantages include the ability to apply water and nutrients directly and efficiently within the crop root zone. Disadvantages of SDI in commercial agriculture relative to alternative irrigation systems include greater capital cost per unit land area (except for small land parcels), unfamiliar management and maintenance protocols that can exacerbate the potential for emitter clogging, the visibility of system attributes (components and design characteristics) and performance, and the susceptibility to damage (i.e., rodents and tillage) of the subsurface driplines. Despite these disadvantages, SDI continues to be adopted in commercial agriculture in the U.S., and research efforts to evaluate and develop SDI systems continue as well. This article summarizes recent progress in research (2010 to 2020) and the status of commercial adoption of SDI, along with a discussion of current challenges and future opportunities.",

The current expert consensus document offers an update in areas for which new evidence has emerged. In the light of published literature, modular minimal invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC) has been established as a safe and effective perfusion technique that increases biocompatibility and ultimately ensures perfusion safety in all adult cardiac surgical procedures, including re-operations, aortic arch and emergency surgery. Moreover, it was recognized that incorporation of MiECC strategies advances minimal invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) by combining reduced surgical trauma with minimal physiologic derangements. Minimal Invasive Extracorporeal Technologies International Society considers MiECC as a physiologically-based multidisciplinary strategy for performing cardiac surgery that is associated with significant evidence-based clinical benefit that has accrued over the years. Widespread adoption of this technology is thus strongly advocated to obtain additional healthcare benefit while advancing patient care.",

Recognizing pain is fundamental to successful treatment, and diagnostic guides and algorithms are included for assessment of both acute and chronic pain. Particularly for chronic pain, capturing owner evaluation is important, and pain-assessment instruments for pet owners are described. Expert consensus emphasizes proactive, preemptive pain management rather than a reactive, \"damage control\" approach. The guidelines discuss treatment options centered on preemptive, multimodal analgesic therapies. There is an extensive variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for the management of acute and chronic pain in cats and dogs.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to update recommendations for prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) for patients with rheumatic or nonrheumatic conditions receiving >3 months treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) ≥2.5 mg daily. METHODS: An updated systematic literature review was performed for clinical questions on nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic treatments, discontinuation of medications, and sequential therapy. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A Voting Panel achieved ≥70% consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations. RESULTS: For adults beginning or continuing >3 months of GC treatment, we strongly recommend as soon as possible after initiation of GCs, initial assessment of fracture risks with clinical fracture assessment, bone mineral density with vertebral fracture assessment or spinal x-ray, and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool if ≥40 years old. For adults at medium, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend pharmacologic treatment. Choice of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab, or parathyroid hormone analogs should be made by shared decision-making. Anabolic agents are conditionally recommended as initial therapy for those with high and very high fracture risk. Recommendations are made for special populations, including children, people with organ transplants, people who may become pregnant, and people receiving very high-dose GC treatment. New recommendations for both discontinuation of osteoporosis therapy and sequential therapies are included. CONCLUSION: This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions for management of GIOP. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to update recommendations for prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) for patients with rheumatic or nonrheumatic conditions receiving >3 months treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) ≥2.5 mg daily. METHODS: An updated systematic literature review was performed for clinical questions on nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic treatments, discontinuation of medications, and sequential therapy. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A Voting Panel achieved ≥70% consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations. RESULTS: For adults beginning or continuing >3 months of GC treatment, we strongly recommend as soon as possible after initiation of GCs, initial assessment of fracture risks with clinical fracture assessment, bone mineral density with vertebral fracture assessment or spinal x-ray, and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool if ≥40 years old. For adults at medium, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend pharmacologic treatment. Choice of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab, or parathyroid hormone analogs should be made by shared decision-making. Anabolic agents are conditionally recommended as initial therapy for those with high and very high fracture risk. Recommendations are made for special populations, including children, people with organ transplants, people who may become pregnant, and people receiving very high-dose GC treatment. New recommendations for both discontinuation of osteoporosis therapy and sequential therapies are included. CONCLUSION: This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions for management of GIOP. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The field of genetics and genomics continues to expand at an unprecedented pace. As scientific knowledge is translated to clinical practice, genomic information is routinely being used in preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic decision-making across a variety of clinical practice areas. As adoption of genomic medicine further evolves, health professionals will be required to stay abreast of new genetic discoveries and technologies and implementation of these advances within their scope of practice will be indicated. METHODS: The Association of Professors of Human and Medical Genetics previously developed medical school genetics core competencies, last updated in 2013. The competencies were reviewed and updated through a structured approach incorporating a modified Delphi method. RESULTS: The updated Association of Professors of Human and Medical Genetics core competencies are presented. Current revisions include competencies that are concise, specific, and assessable. In addition, they incorporate recent advances in clinical practice and promote equity and inclusion in clinical care. CONCLUSION: The 2022 competencies will serve as a guide for medical school leadership and educators involved in curriculum development, implementation, and assessment. Use of these competencies across the undergraduate medical curricula will foster knowledge, skills, and behaviors required in medical practice across a wide range of specialties.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Certified Flight Registered Nurse (CFRN) credential independently validates a registered nurse's advanced knowledge, skills, and abilities in the unique specialty of flight nursing. Introduced in 1993 and celebrating its 30th anniversary in July 2023, the CFRN is held by over 5,500 registered nurses. The purpose of the 2022 CFRN pulse survey was to better understand the ways CFRN-certified registered nurses value this national flight nursing specialty credential. The CFRN survey is a companion to the 2022 Certified Transport Registered Nurse pulse survey, which focused on the Certified Transport Registered Nurse critical care ground transport nursing credential. METHODS: The Board of Certification for Emergency Nursing e-mailed individuals in its database of CFRN credential holders and asked them to respond to a 14-question online survey between October 17, 2022, and November 8, 2022. Participation in the survey was voluntary. Of the 5,275 verified CFRN holders who received the survey, 992 responded, for a response rate of 18.8%. The survey instrument included discrete field and open-ended questions. Data were deidentified for analysis, and institutional review board exemption was received. Counts and percentages were reported, and descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: The highest percentage of flight nurses who responded have more than 10 years of experience in flight nursing (35.3%) and are employed by a stand-alone transport program (42.7%). Flight nurses reported they spent a mean of 70% of their work hours transporting via rotor wing aircraft, with a predominantly adult patient population. The top perceived benefits of being a CFRN-certified nurse were a sense of accomplishment and pride (90.7%) followed by flight physiology knowledge (85.4%), flight nursing clinical knowledge (83.4%), and confidence as a flight nurse (80.6%). CONCLUSION: The 2022 CFRN pulse survey identified current CFRN demographics, practice environments including transport percentage by mode and patient population types, and perceived benefits of the CFRN credential. The findings suggest CFRNs are very experienced, provide care for patients across the age continuum, and perceive multiple intrinsic and extrinsic benefits of CFRN certification, all of which are essential to safe, evidence-based advanced nursing practice in the unique, complex, autonomous, and dynamic flight environment.",

After multiple years of mostly modest growth, the number of CTRNs surged in 2020 and 2021 and continues to post strong growth into 2022. The aim of the 2022 Certified Transport Registered Nurse Pulse Survey was to better understand the ways in which CTRN-certified registered nurses value this national ground transport specialty credential and gain insight into factors that may have contributed to the recent surge in CTRN certification. METHODS: The Board of Certification for Emergency Nursing e-mailed individuals in its database of CTRN credential holders and invited them to complete an 11-question online survey between March 15 and March 28, 2022. Participation in the survey was voluntary. Sixty-three of 297 verified CTRN holders who received the survey responded for a response rate of 21.2%. The survey instrument included discrete field and open-ended questions. Data were deidentified for analysis, and institutional review board exemption was received. Descriptive statistics were used, and counts and percentages are reported. RESULTS: The highest percentage of respondents (42.9%) have 10 or more years of experience in ground transport nursing, and nearly half (46%) are employed by a stand-alone transport program. Forty-three percent of all respondents reported that ground transport makes up at least 50% of their current role, whereas one third (33.3%) indicated they do ground transport 100% of the time. Critical thinking (87.5%) in the ground transport environment, confidence as a ground transport nurse (87.5%), and a sense of accomplishment and pride (94.6%) were the top 3 perceived benefits of being a CTRN-certified nurse. CONCLUSION: The 2022 CTRN pulse survey identified current CTRN demographics, practice environments, and perceived benefits of the CTRN credential. The findings suggest CTRNs are highly experienced and perceive multiple intrinsic and extrinsic benefits of CTRN certification, many of which are essential to safe, evidence-based nursing practice in the autonomous, complex, and dynamic ground transport environment.",

To understand the current state of research on racism in EM health care research, we developed a consensus working group on this topic, which concluded a year of work with a consensus-building session as part of the overall Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) consensus conference on diversity, equity, and inclusion: \"Developing a Research Agenda for Addressing Racism in Emergency Medicine,\" held on May 10, 2022. In this article, we report the development, details of preconference methods and preliminary results, and the final consensus of the Healthcare Research Working Group. Preconference work based on literature review and expert opinion identified 13 potential priority research questions that were refined through an iterative process to a list of 10. During the conference, the subgroup used consensus methodology and a \"consensus dollar\" (contingent valuation) approach to prioritize research questions. The subgroup identified three research gaps: remedies for racial bias and systematic racism, biases and heuristics in clinical care, and racism in study design, and we derived a list of six high-priority research questions for our specialty.",

    "abstract": "Integrated photonics will play a key role in quantum systems as they grow from few-qubit prototypes to tens of thousands of qubits. The underlying optical quantum technologies can only be realized through the integration of these components onto quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs) with accompanying electronics. In the last decade, remarkable advances in quantum photonic integration have enabled table-top experiments to be scaled down to prototype chips with improvements in efficiency, robustness, and key performance metrics. These advances have enabled integrated quantum photonic technologies combining up to 650 optical and electrical components onto a single chip that are capable of programmable quantum information processing, chip-to-chip networking, hybrid quantum system integration, and high-speed communications. In this roadmap article, we highlight the status, current and future challenges, and emerging technologies in several key research areas in integrated quantum photonics, including photonic platforms, quantum and classical light sources, quantum frequency conversion, integrated detectors, and applications in computing, communications, and sensing. With advances in materials, photonic design architectures, fabrication and integration processes, packaging, and testing and benchmarking, in the next decade we can expect a transition from single- and few-function prototypes to large-scale integration of multi-functional and reconfigurable devices that will have a transformative impact on quantum information science and engineering.",

    "abstract": "Renewable fuel generation is essential for a low carbon footprint economy. Thus, over the last five decades, a significant effort has been dedicated towards increasing the performance of solar fuels generating devices. Specifically, the solar to hydrogen efficiency of photoelectrochemical cells has progressed steadily towards its fundamental limit, and the faradaic efficiency towards valuable products in CO2 reduction systems has increased dramatically. However, there are still numerous scientific and engineering challenges that must be overcame in order to turn solar fuels into a viable technology. At the electrode and device level, the conversion efficiency, stability and products selectivity must be increased significantly. Meanwhile, these performance metrics must be maintained when scaling up devices and systems while maintaining an acceptable cost and carbon footprint. This roadmap surveys different aspects of this endeavor: system benchmarking, device scaling, various approaches for photoelectrodes design, materials discovery, and catalysis. Each of the sections in the roadmap focuses on a single topic, discussing the state of the art, the key challenges and advancements required to meet them. The roadmap can be used as a guide for researchers and funding agencies highlighting the most pressing needs of the field.",

DESIGN: A population exposure comparison outcome format was used to represent patient, exposure, comparison, and outcome. Population Exposure Comparison Outcome questions were distributed to worksheet authors who performed comprehensive searches, summarized the evidence, and created guideline recommendations that were reviewed by domain chairs. The revised guidelines then underwent the Delphi survey process to reach consensus on the final guidelines. Diseases evaluated in this iteration included heartworm disease (dogs and cats), immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (cats), protein-losing nephropathy (cats), protein-losing enteropathy (dogs and cats), sepsis (cats), hyperadrenocorticism (cats), liver disease (dogs), congenital portosystemic shunts (dogs and cats) and the following interventions: IV catheters (dogs and cats), arterial catheters (dogs and cats), vascular access ports (dogs and cats), extracorporeal circuits (dogs and cats) and transvenous pacemakers (dogs and cats). RESULTS: Of the diseases evaluated in this iteration, a high risk for thrombosis was defined as heartworm disease or protein-losing enteropathy. Low risk for thrombosis was defined as dogs with liver disease, cats with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, protein-losing nephropathy, sepsis, or hyperadrenocorticism. CONCLUSIONS: Associations with thrombosis are outlined for various conditions and interventions and provide the basis for management recommendations. Numerous knowledge gaps were identified that represent opportunities for future studies.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Precision medicine is data-driven health care tailored to individual patients based on their unique attributes, including biologic profiles, disease expressions, local environments, and socioeconomic conditions. Emergency medicine (EM) has been peripheral to the precision medicine discourse, lacking both a unified definition of precision medicine and a clear research agenda. We convened a national consensus conference to build a shared mental model and develop a research agenda for precision EM. METHODS: We held a conference to (1) define precision EM, (2) develop an evidence-based research agenda, and (3) identify educational gaps for current and future EM clinicians. Nine preconference workgroups (biomedical ethics, data science, health professions education, health care delivery and access, informatics, omics, population health, sex and gender, and technology and digital tools), comprising 84 individuals, garnered expert opinion, reviewed relevant literature, engaged with patients, and developed key research questions. During the conference, each workgroup shared how they defined precision EM within their domain, presented relevant conceptual frameworks, and engaged a broad set of stakeholders to refine precision EM research questions using a multistage consensus-building process. RESULTS: A total of 217 individuals participated in this initiative, of whom 115 were conference-day attendees. Consensus-building activities yielded a definition of precision EM and key research questions that comprised a new 10-year precision EM research agenda. The consensus process revealed three themes: (1) preeminence of data, (2) interconnectedness of research questions across domains, and (3) promises and pitfalls of advances in health technology and data science/artificial intelligence. The Health Professions Education Workgroup identified educational gaps in precision EM and discussed a training roadmap for the specialty. CONCLUSIONS: A research agenda for precision EM, developed with extensive stakeholder input, recognizes the potential and challenges of precision EM. Comprehensive clinician training in this field is essential to advance EM in this domain.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The trauma mortality rate is higher in the elderly compared with younger patients. Ageing is associated with physiological changes in multiple systems and correlated with frailty. Frailty is a risk factor for mortality in elderly trauma patients. We aim to provide evidence-based guidelines for the management of geriatric trauma patients to improve it and reduce futile procedures. METHODS: Six working groups of expert acute care and trauma surgeons reviewed extensively the literature according to the topic and the PICO question assigned. Statements and recommendations were assessed according to the GRADE methodology and approved by a consensus of experts in the field at the 10th international congress of the WSES in 2023. RESULTS: The management of elderly trauma patients requires knowledge of ageing physiology, a focused triage, including drug history, frailty assessment, nutritional status, and early activation of trauma protocol to improve outcomes. Acute trauma pain in the elderly has to be managed in a multimodal analgesic approach, to avoid side effects of opioid use. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in penetrating (abdominal, thoracic) trauma, in severely burned and in open fractures elderly patients to decrease septic complications. Antibiotics are not recommended in blunt trauma in the absence of signs of sepsis and septic shock. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH should be administrated as soon as possible in high and moderate-risk elderly trauma patients according to the renal function, weight of the patient and bleeding risk. A palliative care team should be involved as soon as possible to discuss the end of life in a multidisciplinary approach considering the patient's directives, family feelings and representatives' desires, and all decisions should be shared. CONCLUSIONS: The management of elderly trauma patients requires knowledge of ageing physiology, a focused triage based on assessing frailty and early activation of trauma protocol to improve outcomes. Geriatric Intensive Care Units are needed to care for elderly and frail trauma patients in a multidisciplinary approach to decrease mortality and improve outcomes.",

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of literature pertinent to ALS following Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Prioritized questions were each reviewed by Evidence Evaluators, and findings were reconciled by ALS Domain Chairs and Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) Co-Chairs to arrive at treatment recommendations commensurate to quality of evidence, risk:benefit relationship, and clinical feasibility. This process was implemented using an Evidence Profile Worksheet for each question that included an introduction, consensus on science, treatment recommendations, justification for these recommendations, and important knowledge gaps. A draft of these worksheets was distributed to veterinary professionals for comment for 4 weeks prior to finalization. SETTING: Transdisciplinary, international collaboration in university, specialty, and emergency practice. RESULTS: Seventeen questions pertaining to vascular access, vasopressors in shockable and nonshockable rhythms, anticholinergics, defibrillation, antiarrhythmics, and adjunct drug therapy as well as open-chest CPR were reviewed. Of the 33 treatment recommendations formulated, 6 recommendations addressed the management of patients with nonshockable arrest rhythms, 10 addressed shockable rhythms, and 6 provided guidance on open-chest CPR. We recommend against high-dose epinephrine even after prolonged CPR and suggest that atropine, when indicated, is used only once. In animals with a shockable rhythm in which initial defibrillation was unsuccessful, we recommend doubling the defibrillator dose once and suggest vasopressin (or epinephrine if vasopressin is not available), esmolol, lidocaine in dogs, and/or amiodarone in cats. CONCLUSIONS: These updated RECOVER ALS guidelines clarify the approach to refractory shockable rhythms and prolonged CPR. Very low quality of evidence due to absence of clinical data in dogs and cats continues to compromise the certainty with which recommendations can be made.",

This process was implemented using an Evidence Profile Worksheet for each question that included an introduction, consensus on science, treatment recommendations, justification for these recommendations, and important knowledge gaps. A draft of these worksheets was distributed to veterinary professionals for comment for 4 weeks prior to finalization. SETTING: Transdisciplinary, international collaboration in university, specialty, and emergency practice. RESULTS: Twenty questions regarding animal position, chest compression point and technique, ventilation strategies, as well as the duration of CPR cycles and chest compression pauses were examined, and 32 treatment recommendations were formulated. Out of these, 25 addressed chest compressions and 7 informed ventilation during CPR. The recommendations were founded predominantly on very low quality of evidence and expert opinion. These new treatment recommendations continue to emphasize the critical importance of high-quality, uninterrupted chest compressions, with a modification suggested for the chest compression technique in wide-chested dogs. When intubation is not possible, bag-mask ventilation using a tight-fitting facemask with oxygen supplementation is recommended rather than mouth-to-nose ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: These updated RECOVER BLS treatment recommendations emphasize continuous chest compressions, conformation-specific chest compression techniques, and ventilation for all animals. Very low quality of evidence due to absence of clinical data in dogs and cats consistently compromised the certainty of recommendations, emphasizing the need for more veterinary research in this area.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodology used by the Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) to re-evaluate the scientific evidence relevant to CPR in small and large animals, to newborn resuscitation, and to first aid and to formulate the respective consensus-based clinical guidelines. DESIGN: This report describes the evidence-to-guidelines process employed by RECOVER that is based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and includes Information Specialist-driven systematic literature search, evidence evaluation conducted by more than 200 veterinary professionals, and provision of clinical guidelines in the domains of Preparedness and Prevention, Basic Life Support, Advanced Life Support, Post-cardiac Arrest Care, Newborn Resuscitation, First Aid, and Large Animal CPR. SETTING: Transdisciplinary, international collaboration in academia, referral practice, and general practice. RESULTS: For this update to the RECOVER 2012 CPR guidelines, we answered 135 Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) questions with the help of a team of Domain Chairs, Information Specialists, and more than 200 Evidence Evaluators. Most primary contributors were veterinary specialists or veterinary technician specialists. The RECOVER 2024 Guidelines represent the first veterinary application of the GRADE approach to clinical guideline development. We employed an iterative process that follows a predefined sequence of steps designed to reduce bias of Evidence Evaluators and to increase the repeatability of the quality of evidence assessments and ultimately the treatment recommendations. The process also allowed numerous important knowledge gaps to emerge that form the foundation for prioritizing research efforts in veterinary resuscitation science. CONCLUSIONS: Large collaborative, volunteer-based development of evidence- and consensus-based clinical guidelines is challenging and complex but feasible. The experience gained will help refine the process for future veterinary guidelines initiatives.",

Of these, 5 recommendations pertained to aspects of end-tidal CO2 (ETco2) measurement. The recommendations were founded predominantly on very low quality of evidence, with some based on expert opinion. CONCLUSIONS: The Monitoring Domain authors continue to support initiation of chest compressions without pulse palpation. We recommend multimodal monitoring of patients at risk of cardiopulmonary arrest, at risk of re-arrest, or under general anesthesia. This report highlights the utility of ETco2 monitoring to verify correct intubation, identify return of spontaneous circulation, evaluate quality of CPR, and guide basic life support measures. Treatment recommendations further suggest intra-arrest evaluation of electrolytes (ie, potassium and calcium), as these may inform outcome-relevant interventions.",

DESIGN: These RECOVER CPR Guidelines were generated using a modified version of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system for evidence evaluation and translation of this evidence into clear and actionable clinical instructions. Prioritized clinical questions in the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format were used as the basis to conduct systematic literature searches by information specialists, to extract information from relevant publications, to assess this evidence for quality, and finally to translate the findings into treatment recommendations. These recommendations were reviewed by the RECOVER writing group and opened for comment by veterinary professionals for 4 weeks. SETTING: Transdisciplinary, international collaboration in university, specialty, and emergency practice. RESULTS: A total of 40 worksheets were prepared to evaluate questions across the 3 domains of BLS, ALS and Monitoring, resulting in 90 individual treatment recommendations. High-dose epinephrine is no longer recommended, and atropine, if used, is only administered once. Bag-mask ventilation is prioritized over mouth-to-nose ventilation in nonintubated animals. In addition, an algorithm for initial assessment, an updated CPR algorithm, a rhythm diagnosis tool, and an updated drug dosing table are provided. CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of the BLS and ALS recommendations remain unchanged, some noteworthy changes were made due to new evidence that emerged over the past 10 years. Indirectness of evidence remains the largest impediment to the certainty of guidelines formulation and underscores an urgent need for more studies in the target species of dogs and cats.",

These proteins are essential to many physiological functions, including replication, recombination, and repair, in a host of organisms ranging from bacteriophage to higher eukaryotes. Thus, single-stranded DNA binding proteins represent systems that have evolved substantially beyond primitive precursors, which may only have been capable of direct and uncontrolled nucleic acid binding. The chapter describes molecular aspects of the involvement of DNA binding proteins in entire systems of DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Nature and measurement of DNA–protein interactions along with general purification strategies for single-stranded DNA binding proteins are also presented. In addition, the chapter discusses the ways in which the single-stranded DNA binding proteins have been exploited as tools in molecular biological research, particularly in the electron microscopy of biological macromolecules and in certain biochemical assays. All DNA binding proteins seem to operate stoichiometrically (as opposed to catalytically), in that they are present at intracellular levels sufficient to effectively saturate the single-stranded DNA intermediates produced during replication, recombination, and repair. Binding cooperativity is essential in permitting complete coverage of single-stranded sequences and also in effectively destabilizing the small duplex hairpins formed by intrastrand base pairing in single-stranded DNA. © 1981, Academic Press, Inc.",

But now society is faced with a new set of nutrition problems related to energy imbalance and metabolic disease, which require new kinds of solutions. Recent developments in the area of new analytical tools enable us to systematically study large quantities of detailed and multidimensional metabolic and health data, providing the opportunity to address current nutrition problems through an approach called Precision Nutrition. This approach integrates different kinds of \"big data\" to expand our understanding of the complexity and diversity of human metabolism in response to diet. With these tools, we can more fully elucidate each individual's unique phenotype, or the current state of health, as determined by the interactions among biology, environment, and behavior. The tools of precision nutrition include genomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, phenotyping, high-throughput analytical chemistry techniques, longitudinal tracking with body sensors, informatics, data science, and sophisticated educational and behavioral interventions. These tools are enabling the development of more personalized and predictive dietary guidance and interventions that have the potential to transform how the public makes food choices and greatly improve population health.",

He received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant with cells harboring an HIV-resistant genotype. To mimic this result, we have initiated a Phase I to evaluate the safety of an autologous stem cell gene therapy bone marrow transplant in HIV-related lymphoma patients. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The first cohort of patients will receive a 1:1 ratio of unmanipulated CD34 hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and lentivector modified CD34 HSC expressing a combination of HIV-resistant genes and a selectable marker for cell sorting prior to transplantation. Safety of the HIV-resistant stem cells will be assessed by evaluating engraftment, expression of the anti-HIV genes, and the stability and sequence of the vector. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: One patient has been enrolled and transplanted with the HIV-resistant stem cells. After 1 and 2 months post-transplant, patient blood samples were received, processed for genomic DNA, analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and displayed successful engraftment of 16 and 12 vector copies per 100 cells, respectively. Expression of all anti-HIV genes was confirmed by qPCR. PCR on genomic DNA confirmed the correct sizes and sequences of the integrated vector and confirmed the successful engraftment of our gene modified cells. Currently, we are enrolling more patients into the trial. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: If successful, this therapy has the potential to change HIV treatment.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) can lead to pain, disability, and permanent spinal cord impairment. Timely diagnosis and surgical intervention is essential to optimize functional outcomes for patients with CSM. Here, we compared patients who were admitted through clinic versus the emergency department (ED) for surgical management of DCM. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Patients aged ≥18 years admitted for surgery for DCM through clinic (elective cohort) were compared to a surgical cohort who were evaluated through the ED (call cohort). Basic demographics included age, gender, race, ethnicity, and insurance payor. Sociodemographic characteristics were estimated using the Social Deprivation Index (SDI) and the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) for the state of California, which were obtained through aggregated Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). Cervical MRI was reviewed to assess severity of spinal cord compression. Other outcomes included number of motion segments operated on, functional outcome using the Nurick classification, length of stay (LOS), disposition, and 30-day reoperation and readmission rates. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: From 2015 to 2021, 327 DCM patients received surgery (227 Elective Cohort, 100 Call Cohort). Elective cohort was mainly female (48.0 vs 30.0%, p=0.002) and white (72.7 vs 51.0%, p=0.0001). Call cohort was mainly uninsured/covered by Medicare/Medicaid (78.0 vs 67.0%, p=0.04), had higher SDI (68.0 vs 56.2, p=0.0003), ADI (7.9 vs 7.2, p=0.009), and cervical cord compression on MRI (78.0 vs 42.3% Grade III, p DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to DCM patients undergoing elective surgery, those admitted through the ED were more likely to be male, non-White, and socioeconomically disadvantaged, as measured by SDI and ADI. Postoperative outcomes were less favorable for these patients, including longer hospital stay, discharge disposition, and less Nurick grading improvement.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundSkin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) are common infections seen in the Emergency Department (ED). However, adherence to IDSA guidelines for treatment, in terms of antibiotic selection and duration, is poor. . To evaluate the ability of a multifaceted intervention to improve adherence to the 2014 IDSA guidelines for the management of SSTIs in an academic adult and pediatric ED.MethodsA non-randomized study of a multifaceted intervention for SSTI in the ED was employed which included educational presentations, implementation of an electronic order set based on 2014 IDSA guidelines, dissemination of ED-specific antibiograms, monthly departmental peer comparisons, and bimonthly individual feedback. SSTI visits were identified using ICD-10 codes L00, L02.x1, L03, L08.89, and L08.9. The primary endpoint was adherence to IDSA guidelines. Outcomes during the preintervention and intervention periods, adjusting for patient demographics and infection characteristics, were compared with the same time periods at a control site (CS) that did not implement the intervention.ResultsThere were 583 SSTIs included in the study [intervention site (IS) =283, CS =300] split over three time periods: preintervention (October 2015–March 2016; IS = 130, CS = 150), intervention (October 2016–March 2017; IS = 99, CS = 150), and postintervention (April 2017–July 2017; IS = 54, CS = 0). At the IS, adherence was 41% prior to the intervention and 51% during the intervention. At the CS adherence was 19% and 25% during the two time periods. In the adjusted model, adherence at the IS was higher during the intervention compared with the preintervention period [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.26 (95% CI 1.24–4.10)]. Adherence in the postintervention period was similar to the preintervention period [aOR 0.94 (0.45–1.97)]. No changes were seen during the two time periods at the CS [aOR 1.00 (0.53–1.89)].ConclusionImplementation of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention for SSTI significantly improved adherence to IDSA guidelines; however, adherence regressed after the intervention ended. Additionally, adherence was generally poor in all time periods and at both sites. Further research is needed to understand barriers and challenges to implementation of SSTI guidelines in ED settings.Disclosures , Merck: Grant Investigator, Research grant",

    "abstract": "Excesses of 226Ra in arc magmas have been interpreted as resulting from flux melting of the mantle above subducting slabs, followed by fast ascent rates of magma from slab to surface (up to 1000 m/yr). However, we demonstrate that incongruent melting of the lower crust could either maintain or augment mantle-derived 226Ra excesses, and so reduce inferred vertical transport rates. We developed an incongruent, continuous melting model, and both the incongruent melting reaction and ingrowth effects contribute to the 226Ra excess. In particular, we found that dehydration melting of amphibolite can produce modeled 226Ra excesses greater than 300%. Mixtures of such amphibolite dehydration melts with mantle melts will likely retain a 238U excess (subducted slab) signature. This amphibolite dehydration melting process will also produce elevated ratios of light rare earth elements to heavy rare earth elements, similar to those observed in several arc settings, which may distinguish these magmas from those with 226Ra excesses produced by slab dewatering alone. © 2005 Geological Society of America.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a 230-GHz wideband harmonic voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with large output power based on a compact and low-loss structure of coupled standing wave oscillators. In order to boost the output power, oscillators are coupled together without adding extra passive loss to the circuit. Transistors with inductive drain impedances provide the necessary negative resistance to the oscillators while simultaneously acting as active variable capacitors for frequency tuning and generate the desired second-harmonic power through their nonlinearities. Transmission lines at the drains are responsible for creating the inductive impedance as well as coupling adjacent oscillators and routing and combining the output power. Therefore, the circuit has a compact structure that minimizes passive losses. A varactor-less frequency tuning scheme is used and allows for wideband operation without sacrificing the output power. In addition to oscillator coupling and minimizing the losses, the output power has been boosted by engineering the harmonic impedance that is seen by the transistors in the circuit. The prototype chip was implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process. The output power of the VCO covers 219-238 GHz frequency band (8.35% tuning range) and delivers 3.4-dBm maximum output power. The minimum measured phase noise is -105.8 dBc/Hz (at 10-MHz offset) while consuming 195 mW from a 1.5-V supply.",

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Human exhaled breath is rich in metabolomic content that represents pulmonary function and gas exchange with blood. It contains a mixture of compounds that offer insight into an individual’s state of health. Here, we present two novel non-invasive breath sampling devices for use in basic medical practice. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The two breath samplers have a disposable mouthpiece, a set of inhale and exhale one-way flap valves to allow condensation of exhaled breath only, and a saliva filter. The housing is constructed out of Teflon®, a chemically inert material to reduce chemical absorbance. The first device condenses exhaled breath into a frozen condensate using dry ice pellets and the other is a miniaturized design that liquifies exhaled breath on a condenser surface with micropatterned features on a cooling plate. Both designs have individual strategic and analytical advantages: frozen exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has high retention of analytes and sample volume; EBC collected in liquid phase offers facilitated sample collection and device portability. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We investigated if breath aerosol size distribution affects the types or abundances of metabolites. We modified the geometry of the first device to redirect aerosol trajectories based on size. The trapping of larger aerosols increases with filter length, thus altering the aerosol size distribution although no significant changes in the metabolite profiles were found. With the miniaturized device, metabolite abundances were measured in a small cohort of healthy control and mild asthmatic subjects. Differences among subjects were found, as well as main differences between control and asthmatic groups. All analyses of EBC were performed with liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. Inflammatory suppression found in asthmatic subjects can be explained by prescribed daily use of inhaled corticosteroids. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Breath collection devices can be used in intensive care units, outpatient clinics, workplaces, and at home. EBC analysis has been used to monitor asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It can be applied to infectious respiratory diseases (e.g. influenza, COVID-19) and for monitoring environmental and occupational chemical exposures.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Humans rapidly adapt reaching movements in response to perturbations (e.g., manipulations of movement dynamics or visual feedback). Following a break, when reexposed to the same perturbation, subjects demonstrate savings, a faster learning rate compared with the time course of initial training. Although this has been well studied, there are open questions on the extent early savings reflects the rapid recall of previous performance. To address this question, we examined how the properties of initial training (duration and final adaptive state) influence initial single-trial adaptation to force-field perturbations when training sessions were separated by 24 h. There were two main groups that were distinct based on the presence or absence of a washout period at the end of day 1 (with washout vs. without washout). We also varied the training duration on day 1 (15, 30, 90, or 160 training trials), resulting in 8 subgroups of subjects. We show that single-trial adaptation on day 2 scaled with training duration, even for similar asymptotic levels of learning on day 1 of training. Interestingly, the temporal force profile following the first perturbation on day 2 matched that at the end of day 1 for the longest training duration group that did not complete the washout. This correspondence persisted but was significantly lower for shorter training durations and the washout subject groups. Collectively, the results suggest that the adaptation observed very early in reexposure results from the rapid recall of the previously learned motor recalibration but is highly dependent on the initial training duration and final adaptive state.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The extent initial readaptation reflects the recall of previous motor performance is largely unknown. We examined early single-trial force-field adaptation on the second day of training and distinguished initial retention from recall. We found that the single-trial adaptation following the 24-h break matched that at the end of the first day, but this recall was modified by the training duration and final level of learning on the first day of training.",

Converging evidence from both experimental and epidemiological studies indicates that there is a bidirectional association between depression and cardiovascular disease; however, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying this relationship are not well understood. Disruptions in the social environment may influence this relationship. METHODS: Depression-relevant behaviors and ambulatory electrocardiographic and activity data were measured in 12 adult, socially monogamous prairie voles (rodents) during a period of chronic social isolation or social pairing (control conditions). RESULTS: Prairie voles exposed to 4 weeks of social isolation versus control conditions (social pairing) exhibited anhedonia, increased 24-hour heart rate, reduced 24-hour heart rate variability, and predictable correlations between the behavioral measure (anhedonia) and the autonomic measures. CONCLUSIONS: Social isolation is associated with depressive behaviors, 24-hour autonomic dysfunction, and predictable interrelationships between these variables in prairie voles but does not seem to be associated with rhythmicity changes in activity level or autonomic function. These findings have implications for understanding the role of the social environment in mediating the association of mood and cardiovascular disorders in humans.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The complete mitochondrial respiratory chain is a precondition for maintaining cellular energy supply, development, and metabolic balance. Due to the evolutionary differentiation of complexes and the semi-autonomy of mitochondria, respiratory chain subunits have become critical targets for crop improvement and fungal control. In fungi, mitochondrial complex I mediates growth and metabolism. However, the role of this complex in the pathogenesis of phytopathogenic fungi is largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we identified the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase 24-kDa subunit (VdNuo1) of complex in vascular wilt pathogen, Verticillium dahliae, and examined its functional conservation in phytopathogenic fungi. Based on the treatments with respiratory chain inhibitors, the mitochondria-localized VdNuo1 was confirmed to regulate mitochondrial morphogenesis and homeostasis. VdNuo1 was induced during the different developmental stages in V. dahliae, including hyphal growth, conidiation, and melanized microsclerotia development. The VdNuo1 mutants displayed variable sensitivity to stress factors and decreased pathogenicity in multiple hosts, indicating that VdNuo1 is necessary in stress tolerance and full virulence. Comparative transcriptome analysis demonstrated that VdNuo1 mediates global transcriptional effects, including oxidation and reduction processes, fatty acid, sugar, and energy metabolism. These defects are partly attributed to impairments of mitochondrial morphological integrity, complex assembly, and related functions. Its homologue (CgNuo1) functions in the vegetative growth, melanin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides; however, CgNuo1 does not restore the VdNuo1 mutant to normal phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that VdNuo1 plays important roles in growth, metabolism, microsclerotia development, stress tolerance, and virulence of V. dahliae, sharing novel insight into the function of complex I and a potential fungicide target for pathogenic fungi.",

By integrating RNA and small RNA profiling plus single-molecule and small RNA FISH (smFISH or sRNA-FISH) spatial detection, we demonstrate that the tapetum is the primary site of 24-PHAS precursor and Dcl5 transcripts and the resulting 24-nt phasiRNAs. Interestingly, 24-nt phasiRNAs accumulate in all cell types, with the highest levels in meiocytes, followed by tapetum.

In grasses, two pathways yield abundant phasiRNAs during anther development; miR2275 triggers one class, 24-nt phasiRNAs, coincident with meiosis, while a second class of 21-nt phasiRNAs are present in premeiotic anthers. Here we report that the 24-nt phasiRNA pathway is widely present in flowering plants, indicating that 24-nt reproductive phasiRNAs likely originated with the evolutionary emergence of anthers. Deep comparative genomic analyses demonstrated that this miR2275/24-nt phasiRNA pathway is widely present in eudicots plants, however, it is absent in legumes and in the model plant Arabidopsis, demonstrating a dynamic evolutionary history of this pathway. In Solanaceae species, 24-nt phasiRNAs were observed, but the miR2275 trigger is missing and some loci displaying 12-nt phasing. Both the miR2275-triggered and Solanaceae 24-nt phasiRNAs are enriched in meiotic stages, implicating these phasiRNAs in anther and/or pollen development, a spatiotemporal pattern consistent in all angiosperm lineages that deploy them.",

This paper explores the lessons from past attempts at galvanising international efforts to expand energy efficiency activities through the use of international-level recommendations. Drawing on these lessons, the paper outlines the IEA response to the call for policy advice on energy efficiency through the G8 Gleneagles Plan of Action. Specifically, the paper outlines a 'necessary conditions' framework that was used to develop a set of energy efficiency policy priorities and describes the subsequent recommendations presented to the G8 in Hokkaido-Toyako Summit in 2008. The recommendations cover 25 fields of action in seven priority areas: buildings, appliances, lighting, transport, industry, energy utilities and cross-sectoral issues. Together, the suite of recommendations sets out an ambitious road map for global energy efficiency improvement. If implemented globally without delay, they could save around 8.2GtCO2/yr or 96EJ/yr by 2030.

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Why only some osteoporotic patients maintain response to prolonged bisphosphonate therapy is unknown. We examined bisphosphonate response and its association with serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) level in a \"real world\" setting. Serum 25(OH)D level was strongly associated with maintaining bisphosphonate response arguing that vitamin D may be involved in optimizing prolonged bisphosphonate therapy. INTRODUCTION: This study examined the maintenance of bisphosphonate response in the \"real world\" setting and the association between 25(OH)D and bisphosphonate response using an established composite definition of response. METHODS: Postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density (BMD) treated with bisphosphonates were identified from two New York City practices. Patients were excluded for a history of chronic steroid use, metabolic bone disease, or bisphosphonate non-adherence. Patients were categorized as bisphosphonate non-responders if they had a T-score < -3 that persisted between dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans, a >3% decrease in BMD, or an incident fracture on bisphosphonate therapy, criteria based on the EUROFORS trial. Demographic and clinical data including mean 25(OH)D levels between DEXA scans were obtained. Mean 25(OH)D levels were compared between responders and non-responders and multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with non-response. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were studied. A favorable response to bisphosphonate therapy was seen in 47% (N = 99/210). Patients with a mean 25(OH)D ≥33 ng/ml had a ~4.5-fold greater odds of a favorable response (P < 0.0001). 25(OH)D level was significantly associated with response - a 1 ng/ml decrease in 25(OH)D was associated with ~5% decrease in odds of responding (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-0.98; P = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a mean 25(OH)D ≥33 ng/ml had a substantially greater likelihood of maintaining bisphosphonate response. This threshold level of 25(OH)D is higher than that considered adequate by the Institute of Medicine, arguing that higher levels may be required for specific therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To analyze the outcomes and risk factors associated with endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) in children less than one year of age. BACKGROUND: EMB has proven to be an integral diagnostic tool to evaluate suspected myocarditis, identify tumor histology, and provide tissue-graft surveillance after cardiac transplantation. The morbidity and mortality of EMB has been well established in the adult literature and reviewed in the general pediatric population, but there remains limited data for children in the first year of life. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cardiology database at our institution to identify patients less than one year of age who underwent EMB between 1984 and 2008. Cardiac catheterization reports were reviewed for patient demographics, biopsy indication, procedural details, and complications. RESULTS: A total of 99 EMBs were performed, 49 for evaluation of suspected myocarditis, 43 for transplant rejection surveillance, 3 to identify tumor histology, and 4 for suspected endocardial fibroelastosis. Forty procedures were performed in children age < 6 months with 11 complications and 59 procedures performed in children age ≥ 6 months with four complications. In total, there were 12 EMB procedures (12.1%) with associated complications: 9 arrhythmias, 4 perforations requiring pericardiocentesis, 1 pneumothorax, and 1 death. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between perforation and both weight <8 kg (P = 0.05) and age <6 months (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Endomyocardial biopsies can be performed safely in infants, although children under 6 months of age and less than 8 kg represent a high risk group and deserve special consideration due to the incidence of complications in this cohort.",

A relatively higher number of loci were mapped on chromosome 5B (38%) compared to 5A (34%) and 5D (28%). Differences in the levels of polymorphism among the three chromosomes were partially responsible for these differences. A higher number of duplicated loci was found on chromosome 5B (42%). Three times more loci were mapped on the long arms than on the short arms, and a significantly higher number of probes, loci, and duplicated loci were mapped on the distal halves than on the proximal halves of the chromosome arms. Good overall colinearity was observed among the three homoeologous group 5 chromosomes, except for the previously known 5AL/4AL translocation and a putative small pericentric inversion in chromosome 5A. Statistically significant colinearity was observed between low-copy-number ESTs from wheat homoeologous group 5 and rice chromosomes 12 (88 ESTs), 9 (72 ESTs), and 3 (84 ESTs).",

Expressed sequence tags facilitate the analysis of gene-coding regions and provide a rich source of molecular markers for mapping and comparison with model organisms. The objectives of this study were to construct a high-density EST chromosome bin map of wheat homoeologous group 2 chromosomes to determine the distribution of ESTs, construct a consensus map of group 2 ESTs, investigate synteny, examine patterns of duplication, and assess the colinearity with rice of ESTs assigned to the group 2 consensus bin map. A total of 2600 loci generated from 1110 ESTs were mapped to group 2 chromosomes by Southern hybridization onto wheat aneuploid chromosome and deletion stocks. A consensus map was constructed of 552 ESTs mapping to more than one group 2 chromosome. Regions of high gene density in distal bins and low gene density in proximal bins were found. Two interstitial gene-rich islands flanked by relatively gene-poor regions on both the short and long arms and having good synteny with rice were discovered. The map locations of two ESTs indicated the possible presence of a small pericentric inversion on chromosome 2B. Wheat chromosome group 2 was shown to share syntenous blocks with rice chromosomes 4 and 7.",

    "abstract": "The precise knowledge of the initial 26Al/27Al ratio [(26Al/27Al)0] is crucial if we are to use the very first solid objects formed in our Solar System, calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) as the \"time zero\" age-anchor and guide future work with other short-lived radio-chronometers in the early Solar System, as well as determining the inventory of heat budgets from radioactivities for early planetary differentiation. New high-precision multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) measurements of 27Al/24Mg ratios and Mg-isotopic compositions of nine whole-rock CAIs (six mineralogically characterized fragments and three micro-drilled inclusions) from the CV carbonaceous chondrite, Allende yield a well-defined 26Al-26Mg fossil isochron with an (26Al/27Al)0 of (5.23 ± 0.13) × 10- 5. Internal mineral isochrons obtained for three of these CAIs (A44A, AJEF, and A43) are consistent with the whole-rock CAI isochron. The mineral isochron of AJEF with (26Al/27Al)0 = (4.96 ± 0.25) × 10- 5, anchored to our precisely determined absolute 207Pb-206Pb age of 4567.60 ± 0.36 Ma for the same mineral separates, reinstate the \"canonical\" (26Al/27Al)0 of 5 × 10- 5 for the early Solar System. The uncertainty in (26Al/27Al)0 corresponds to a maximum time span of ± 20 Ka (thousand years), suggesting that the Allende CAI formation events were culminated within this time span. Although all Allende CAIs studied experienced multistage formation history, including melting and evaporation in the solar nebula and post-crystallization alteration likely on the asteroidal parent body, the 26Al-26Mg and U-Pb-isotopic systematics of the mineral separates and bulk CAIs behaved largely as closed-system since their formation. Our data do not support the \"supra-canonical\" 26Al/27Al ratio of individual minerals or their mixtures in CV CAIs, suggesting that the supra-canonical 26Al/27Al ratio in the CV CAIs may have resulted from post-crystallization inter-mineral redistribution of Mg isotopes within an individual inclusion. This redistribution must be volumetrically minor in order to satisfy the mass balance of the precisely defined bulk CAI and bulk mineral data obtained by MC-ICP-MS. The radiogenic 208Pb*/206Pb* ratio obtained as a by-product from the Pb-Pb age dating is used to estimate time-integrated 232Th/238U ratio (κ value) of CAIs. Limited κ variations among the minerals within a single CAI, contrasted by much larger variations among the bulk CAIs, suggest Th/U fractionation occurred prior to crystallization of igneous CAIs. If interpreted as primordial heterogeneity, the κ value can be used to calculate the mean age of the interstellar dust from which the CAIs condensed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Nonigneous CV CAIs yield well-defined internal 26Al-26Mg isochrons consistent with the canonical value. These observations indicate that the canonical 26Al/27Al ratio records initial Al/Mg fractionation by evaporation and condensation in the CV CAI-forming region. The internal isochrons of igneous CV CAIs show a range of inferred initial 26Al/27Al ratios, (4.2-5.2) × 10-5, indicating that CAI melting continued for at least 0.2 Ma after formation of their precursors. A similar range of initial 26Al/27Al ratios is also obtained from the internal isochrons of many CAIs (igneous and nonigneous) in other groups of carbonaceous chondrites. Some CAIs and refractory grains (corundum and hibonite) from unmetamorphosed or weakly metamorphosed chondrites, including CVs, are significantly depleted in 26Al. At least some of these refractory objects may have formed prior to injection of 26Al into the protosolar molecular cloud and its subsequent homogenization in the protoplanetary disk. Bulk aluminum and magnesium-isotope measurements of various types of chondrites plot along the bulk CV CAI isochron, suggesting homogeneous distribution of 26Al and magnesium isotopes in the protoplanetary disk after an epoch of CAI formation. The inferred initial 26Al/27Al ratios of chondrules indicate that most chondrules formed 1-3 Ma after CAIs with the canonical 26Al/27Al ratio. © The Meteoritical Society, 2013.",

However, it is still unclear whether proteasomes regulate fruit development and ripening. In this study, we investigated the function of a core proteasome subunit, SlPBB2, in tomato fruit. We found that silencing the SlPPB2 gene through virus-induced gene silencing resulted in tomato seedling death, while SlPPB2 RNA interference (RNAi-SlPBB2) plants driven by a fruit-specific promoter PP2C present normal development. Further observation reveals that silencing SlPBB2 in fruits impaired the chloroplast development and chlorophyll metabolism of fruits, increased the fruit size, and delayed fruit ripening. These findings provide novel insights into the role of proteasomes in regulating fruit development and ripening.",

This hormone is not secreted via the classical vesicular pathway, and the identification of intracellular proteins that facilitate its release remains lacking. Transfection and expression of the 27-kDa human heat shock protein in bovine arterial endothelial cells doubles the rate of estrogen-induced basic fibroblast growth factor secretion, preferentially inducing the release of high molecular weight forms of the hormone. The secreted basic fibroblast growth factor is mitogenic to breast adenocarcinoma cells cultured in the conditioned medium obtained from the transfected endothelial cells. In contrast, decreasing the level of the endogenous heat shock protein homolog with an antisense vector markedly decreases basic fibroblast growth factor release. Anti-heat shock protein or anti-basic fibroblast growth factor antibodies co-precipitate both proteins from endothelial cell extracts, demonstrating a direct association between the two proteins.

Primary polydipsia is differentiated from psychogenic polydipsia by the lack of a clear psychotic disturbance. We present a case of a 27-month-old boy who presented with polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies, imaging, and an observed water deprivation test were consistent with primary polydipsia. Polydipsia resolved after family limited his fluid intake and began replacing water drinking with other transition objects and behaviors for self-soothing. This case highlights the importance of water deprivation testing to differentiate between causes of polyuria, thereby avoiding misdiagnosis and iatrogenic hyponatremia. Secondly, primary polydipsia can result during the normal stages of child development without overt psychiatric disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference, if any, in lesion detection in ATN and NATN images.Methods: Sixty-one consecutive patients having clinical whole body FDG PET scans for oncologic indications were included. The patients were administered 10-20 mCi FDG intravenously, and imaging on the Advance (GE Medical Systems) was started 45 min-1 h after injection. The emission images were acquired for 4 min and the transmission images for 3 min per bed position. The images were reviewed on the vendor-provided workstation. Four of the interpreting physicians read the ATN images first, and the other read the NATN images first. The interpreting physicians were asked to determine if any lesions were seen on only the ATN or NATN images (discordant findings) and to describe differences in the images not affecting overall interpretation.Results: In the 61 patients, 3 discordant findings with abnormalities on the ATN images but not on the NATN images included the following: lung nodule, AP window node, and small para-aortic node. Observations that did not affect overall interpretation include the following: transmission scan helped localize lesion to be below instead of above the diaphragm; AT-N image better demonstrated liver metastasis; benign lung lesion seen only on ATN image (3 cases); pretracheal node seen better on NATN images; and low grade hilar activity on NATN not seen on ATN images.Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the ATN images detect more lesions than the NATN images, and that reviewing NATN images may not be necessary. A different method for performing this evaluation is now being undertaken.",

Dual-secreting Th17 T cells presumably are the predominant sources of the psoriasis phenotype-driving cytokines, IL-17A and IL-22. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of independently acquired RNA-seq psoriasis datasets to explore the relationship between the expression of IL17A and IL22. This analysis failed to support the existence of dual secreting IL-17A/IL-22 Th17 cells as a major source of these cytokines. However, variable relationships amongst the expression of psoriasis susceptibility genes and of IL17A, IL22, and IL23A were identified. Additionally, to shed light on gene expression relationships in psoriasis, we applied a machine learning nonlinear dimensionality reduction strategy (t-SNE) to display the entire psoriasis transcriptome as a 2-dimensonal image. This analysis revealed a variety of gene clusters, relevant to psoriasis pathophysiology but failed to support a relationship between IL17A and IL22. These results support existing theories on alternative sources of IL-17A and IL-22 in psoriasis such as a Th22 cells and non-T cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Wheat blast is a serious disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (Triticum pathotype) (MoT). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of the 2NS translocation from Aegilops ventricosa (Zhuk.) Chennav on wheat head and leaf blast resistance. Disease phenotyping experiments were conducted in growth chamber, greenhouse, and field environments. Among 418 cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), those with 2NS had 50.4 to 72.3% less head blast than those without 2NS when inoculated with an older MoT isolate under growth chamber conditions. When inoculated with recently collected isolates, cultivars with 2NS had 64.0 to 80.5% less head blast. Under greenhouse conditions when lines were inoculated with an older MoT isolate, those with 2NS had a significant head blast reduction. With newer isolates, not all lines with 2NS showed a significant reduction in head blast, suggesting that the genetic background and/or environment may influence the expression of any resistance conferred by 2NS. However, when near-isogenic lines (NILs) with and without 2NS were planted in the field, there was strong evidence that 2NS conferred resistance to head blast.

    "abstract": "REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Although muscle mass strongly influences performance, there is currently no effective means to measure the 3-dimensional muscle mass of horses. We evaluated a 3-dimensional (3D) scanning methodology for its ability to quantify torso and hindquarter volumes as a proxy for regional muscle mass in horses. OBJECTIVES: Determine the repeatability of 3D scanning volume (V) measurements and their correlation to body weight, estimated body volume and muscle/fat ultrasound (US) depth. METHODS: Handheld 3D photonic scans were performed on 16 Quarter Horses of known body weight 56 days apart (n = 32 scans) with each scan performed in duplicate (n = 32 replicates). Tail head fat, gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle depths were measured using US. Processed scans were cropped to isolate hindquarter (above hock, caudal to tuber coxae) and torso (hindquarter plus dorsal thoracolumbar region) segments and algorithms used to calculate V. Torso and hindquarter volume were correlated with body weight and US using Pearson's correlation and with estimated torso volume (50% body weight / body density) with Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Scans took 2 min with < 3.5% error for duplicate scans. Torso volume (R = 0.90, P< 0.001) and hindquarter volume (R = 0.82, P< 0.001) strongly correlated with body weight and estimated BV (R = 0.91) with low bias. Torso volume moderately correlated to mean muscle US depth (R = 0.4, P< 0.05) and tail head fat (R = 0.42, P< 0.01). Mean muscle US depth moderately correlated to body weight (R = 0.50, P< 0.01). MAIN LIMITATIONS: 3D Scans determine body volume not muscle volume. CONCLUSIONS: The hand-held 3D scan provided a rapid repeatable assessment of torso and hindquarter volume strongly correlated to body weight and estimated volume. Superimposition of regional scans and volume measures could provide a practical means to follow muscle development when tail head fat depth remain constant.",

    "abstract": "This chapter discusses the relationship between nuclear order and the association of homologous DNA sequences in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Homologous chromosomes functionally interact with one another to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced either environmentally (e.g., by gamma-irradiation) or deliberately by the cell (e. g., during meiosis). DNA homology recognition in these instances often involves the (RecA) homolog RAD51 and/or the related gene, DMC1. Evidence for interactions between homologous chromosomes occurring independent of DSB formation and (RecA) homolog function has also been described in meiotic, premeiotic, and mitotically dividing cells of yeast. These interactions presumably depend upon DNA homology but the molecular details of such associations are poorly understood. Both DSB-dependent and -independent homolog associations may be facilitated by the nonrandom organization of chromosomes in the nucleus, including centromere and telomere clustering, which are also discussed.",

These presumably cause a loss of gene expression, by removing positive cis regulatory elements or juxtaposing negative DNA sequences. We report two submicroscopic de novo deletions of 11p13 that cause aniridia but are located >11 kb from the 3' end of PAX6. The clinical manifestations are indistinguishable from cases with chain-terminating mutations in the coding region. Using human x mouse retinoblastoma somatic cell hybrids, we show that PAX6 is transcribed only from the normal allele but not from the deleted chromosome 11 homolog.

Four moles of cofactor are bound/mol of tetrameric enzyme; the binding sites are equivalent and independent. The dissociation constants for NAD and NADH are 16 and 0.25 micronM, respectively. As measured by gel filtration in the absence of cofactor, 0.4 mol of estradiol-17 beta is bound/mol of tetrameric enzyme. Data obtained from isotope exchange at equilibrium indicate that the binding of the cofactor to the enzyme is favored over the binding of steroid, although each may bind in the absence of the other. The rates of cofactor dissociation from the ternary complexes are slower than the rates of steroid dissociation; cofactor dissociation is probably the rate-limiting step. Cofactor analogs modified in the pyridine moiety are cosubstrates, whereas modified adenine derivatives are not.

    "abstract": "Disruption of the homeostasis of oxygenated regulatory lipid mediators (oxylipins), potential markers of exposure to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists, such as 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), is associated with a range of diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Here we test the hypothesis that PCB 126 exposure alters the levels of oxylipins in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (5-weeks old) were treated over a 3-month period every 2 weeks with intraperitoneal injections of PCB 126 in corn oil (cumulative doses of 0, 19.8, 97.8, and 390 µg/kg b.w.; 6 injections total). PCB 126 treatment caused a reduction in growth rates at the highest dose investigated, a dose-dependent decrease in thymus weights, and a dose-dependent increase in liver weights. Liver PCB 126 levels increased in a dose-dependent manner, while levels in plasma were below or close to the detection limit. The ratios of several epoxides to diol metabolites formed via the cytochrome P450 (P450) monooxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) pathway from polyunsaturated fatty acids displayed a dose-dependent decrease in the liver and plasma, whereas levels of oxylipins formed by other metabolic pathways were generally not altered by PCB 126 treatment. The effects of PCB 126 on epoxide-to-diol ratios were associated with an increased CYP1A activity in liver microsomes and an increased sEH activity in liver cytosol and peroxisomes. These results suggest that oxylipins are potential biomarkers of exposure to PCB 126 and that the P450/sEH pathway is a therapeutic target for PCB 126-mediated hepatotoxicity that warrants further attention.",

    "abstract": "PCB 11 (3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl), a contemporary congener produced as a byproduct of current pigment production processes, has recently emerged as a prevalent worldwide pollutant. We recently demonstrated that exposure to PCB 11 increases dendritic arborization in vitro, but the mechanism(s) mediating this effect remain unknown. To address this data gap, primary cortical neuron-glia co-cultures derived from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 48 h to either vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or PCB 11 at concentrations ranging from 1 fM to 1 nM in the absence or presence of pharmacologic antagonists of established molecular targets of higher chlorinated PCBs. Reporter cell lines were used to test activity of PCB 11 at the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and thyroid hormone receptor (THR). PCB 11 lacked activity at the AhR and THR, and antagonism of these receptors had no effect on the dendrite-promoting activity of PCB 11. Pharmacologic antagonism of various calcium channels or treatment with antioxidants also did not alter PCB 11-induced dendritic arborization. In contrast, pharmacologic blockade or shRNA knockdown of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) significantly decreased dendritic growth in PCB 11-exposed cultures, suggesting PCB 11 promotes dendritic growth via CREB-mediated mechanisms. Since CREB signaling is crucial for normal neurodevelopment, and perturbations of CREB signaling have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, our findings suggest that this contemporary pollutant poses a threat to the developing brain, particularly in individuals with heritable mutations that promote CREB signaling.",

METHODS: We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal study in patients with LEM who had been on stable regimens of 3,4-diaminopyridine base (3,4-DAP) for ≥ 3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was >30% deterioration in triple timed up-and-go (3TUG) times during tapered drug withdrawal. The secondary endpoint was self-assessment of LEM-related weakness (W-SAS). RESULTS: Thirty-two participants were randomized to continuous 3,4-DAP or placebo groups. None of the 14 participants who received continuous 3,4-DAP had > 30% deterioration in 3TUG time versus 72% of the 18 who tapered to placebo (P < 0.0001). W-SAS similarly demonstrated an advantage for continuous treatment over placebo (P < 0.0001). Requirement for rescue and adverse events were more common in the placebo group.

    "abstract": "Two hundred and seventy-one compounds including benzoylureas, arylureas and related compounds were assayed using recombinant murine soluble epoxide hydrolase (MsEH) produced from a baculovirus expression system. Among all the insect growth regulators assayed, 18 benzoylphenylurea congeners showed weak activity against MsEH. Newly synthesized cyclohexylphenylurea, 1-benzyl-3-phenylurea, and 1,3-dibenzylurea analogues were rather potent. The introduction of a methyl group at the para-position of the phenyl ring of cyclohexylphenylurea enhanced the activity 6-fold, though similar substituent effects were not seen for any of the benzoylphenylureas. The activities of these compounds, including several previously reported compounds, such as dicyclohexylurea, diphenylurea, and their related analogues (Morisseau et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1999, 96, 8849), were quantitatively analyzed using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3-D QSAR) method. Both steric and electrostatic factors contributing to variations in the activity were visualized using CoMFA. CoMFA results showed that one side of the cyclohexylurea moiety having a trans-amide conformation (A-ring moiety) is surrounded by large sterically unfavorable fields, while the other side of A-ring moiety and the other cyclohexyl group (B-ring moiety) is encompassed by sterically favored fields. Electrostatically negative fields were scattered around the entire molecule, and a positive field surrounds the carbon of the carbonyl group. Hydrophobic fields were visualized using Kellogg's hydropathic interaction (HINT) in conjunction with CoMFA. Hydrophobically favorable fields appeared beside the 4- and 4'-carbon atoms of the cyclohexyl groups, and hydrophobically unfavorable fields surrounded the urea bridge. The addition of the molecular hydrophobicity, log P [corrected], to CoMFA did not improve the correlation significantly. The ligand-binding interactions shown by X-ray crystallographic data were rationalized using the results of the CoMFA and HINT analyses, and the essential physicochemical parameters for the design of new MsEH inhibitors were disclosed.",

While robotic surgery offers the added benefit of three-dimensional (3-D) visualization, telestration technology does not currently exist for this modality. This project aimed to develop a video algorithm to accurately translate a mentor's two-dimensional (2-D) telestration into a 3-D telestration in the da Vinci visual field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prototype 3-D telestration system was constructed to translate 2-D telestration from a mentor station into 3-D graphics for the trainee at the robotic console. This system uses fast image correlation algorithms to allow 2-D images to be placed over the same anatomic location in the two separate video channels of the stereoscopic robotic visualization system. Three subjects of varying surgical backgrounds, blinded to the mode of telestration (2-D vs. 3-D), were tested in the laboratory, using a simulated robotic task. RESULTS: There were few technologic errors (2), only one of which resulted in a task error, in 99 total trials. Only the experienced MIS staff surgeon had a significantly faster task time in 2-D than in 3-D (P < 0.05). The MIS fellow recorded the fastest task times in 2-D and 3-D (P < 0.05). There were nine task errors, six of which were committed by the MIS fellow. The nonsurgeon trainee had the least number of errors but also had the slowest times. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic telestration in 3-D is feasible and does not negatively impact performance in laboratory tasks. We plan to refine the prototype and investigate its use in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The investigations reported here were designed to gain insights into the role of 3-monoiodothyronamine (T1AM) in the brain, where the amine was originally identified and characterized. Extensive deiodinase studies indicated that T1AM was derived from the T4 metabolite, reverse triiodothyronine (revT3), while functional studies provided well-confirmed evidence that T1AM has strong adrenergic-blocking effects. Because a state of adrenergic overactivity prevails when triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations become excessive, the possibility that T3's metabolic partner, revT3, might give rise to an antagonist of those T3 actions was thought to be reasonable. All T1AM studies thus far have required use of pharmacological doses. Therefore we considered that choosing a physiological site of action was a priority and focused on the locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic control center in the brain. Site-directed injections of T1AM into the LC elicited a significant, dose-dependent neuronal firing rate change in a subset of adrenergic neurons with an EC(50)=2.7 microM, a dose well within the physiological range. Further evidence for its physiological actions came from autoradiographic images obtained following intravenous carrier-free (125)I-labeled T1AM injection. These showed that the amine bound with high affinity to the LC and to other selected brain nuclei, each of which is both an LC target and a known T3 binding site. This new evidence points to a physiological role for T1AM as an endogenous adrenergic-blocking neuromodulator in the central noradrenergic system.",

These libraries are rapidly screened with enzyme-linked colorimetric, fluorescent, radiometric, or whole-cell binding assays. While fluorescence-based probes are powerful tools in OBOC screening, their utility is greatly limited by the intrinsic fluorescence of many commonly used solid supports, (e.g. TentaGel), residual coupling reagents, and library compounds. To overcome this problem, we topologically partitioned TentaGel resin with a thin Fmoc-protected outer layer and an unprotected inner core. The inner core was derivatized with 3-nitro-tyrosine, followed by random peptide library construction. Spectral scans from a confocal microscope showed a dramatic decrease in the autofluorescence of blank beads and OBOC peptide libraries across a broad range of the optical spectrum. The quenching capacity of 3-nitro-tyrosine was also visualized in fluorescent micrographs. Using biotin/streptavidin as a model ligand/receptor system, we demonstrated a marked increase in visibility of three commercially available fluorescent probes binding to quenched beads, and increased feasibility of using a robust and efficient fluorescence-based, bead sorting platform known as COPAS. These data show that using 3-nitro-tyrosine as an internal quencher greatly enhances the compatibility of fluorescence-based applications and OBOC combinatorial screening.",

With the use of the above inhibitor, it was demonstrated that the classical methods, i.e. Lineweaver and Burk, which are based on the assumptions of a steady state are inadequate for determining the mechanism and the inhibition constants for the reaction of OTFP with JHE. The reaction was shown to be reversible based on the non-steady state kinetics with a dissocation constant (Ki) of ∼ 1.2 × 10-10 M. Values of 3.37 × 107 M-1 min-1 and 4.1 × 10-3 min-1 for the forward and reverse rate constants were calculated and indicate the nature of slow binding inhibition in comparison to ordinary substrate reactions. An application of Ackermann-Potter plots of tight binding inhibition was presented, and their usefulness in measuring the enzyme molar equivalency and its catalytic number towards JH-I and JH-III was evaluated. The molar equivalency of JHE in T. ni haemolymph which hydrolyzes JH-III (at a final concentration of 5.0 × 10-6 M) at a rate of 33.8 nmol/min-ml was found to be 1.6 × 10-6 M. The catalytic numbers for JH-I and JH-III were 37.1 and 19.4 min-1, respectively. These new kinetic parameters, in addition to the Michaelis constant (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) were applied to a study of enzyme-substrate specificity and an evaluation of the role of JHE in the regulation of JH-titre. © 1985.",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe mid-term 3-year clinical outcomes for small vs large BEV and the relationship between discharge echocardiographic mean gradient (MG) and different definitions of prothesis-patient mismatch (PPM) with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Using the TVT Registry with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services linkage, a propensity-matched analysis of patients receiving 20- vs ≥23-mm BEVs was performed. Spline curves and Kaplan-Meier plots with adjusted HRs determined the relationship between MG and 3-year mortality. RESULTS: In total, 316,091 patients were analyzed; after propensity matching, 8,100 pairs of each group were compared. The 20-mm BEV was associated with higher MGs compared with ≥23-mm BEVs (16.2 ± 7.2 mm Hg vs 11.8 ± 5.7 mm Hg; P < 0.0001). At 3 years, there was no difference in mortality between 20- and ≥23-mm BEVs (31.5% vs 32.5%, respectively; HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.90-1.05). Compared with an MG of 10 to 30 mm Hg, an MG <10 mm Hg (HR: 1.25; 95% CI:1.22-1.27) was associated with increased 3-year mortality. Measured severe PPM and predicted no PPM were associated with increased 3-year mortality (33.5% vs 32.9% vs 32.1%; P < 0.0001) and (33.5% vs 31.1% vs 30%; P < 0.0001), respectively. Low MG and severe measured PPM were associated with lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with small-prosthesis BEVs (20 mm) had identical 3-year survival as those with larger (≥23-mm) BEV valves. Severe measured PPM and low MG (<10 mm Hg), but not predicted severe PPM, were associated with lower LVEF and increased mortality, suggesting that LVEF is the culprit for worse outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insufficient data exist on population-based trends in morbidity and mortality to determine the success of prevention strategies and improvements in health care delivery in stroke. The aim of this study was to determine trends in incidence and outcome (1-year mortality, 28-day case-fatality) in relation to management and risk factors for stroke in the multi-ethnic population of Auckland, New Zealand (NZ) over 30-years. METHODS: Four stroke incidence population-based register studies were undertaken in adult residents (aged ≥15 years) of Auckland NZ in 1981-1982, 1991-1992, 2002-2003 and 2011-2012. All used standard World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria and multiple overlapping sources of case-ascertainment for hospitalised and non-hospitalised, fatal and non-fatal, new stroke events. Ethnicity was consistently self-identified into four major groups. Crude and age-adjusted (WHO world population standard) annual incidence and mortality with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated per 100,000 people, assuming a Poisson distribution. RESULTS: 5400 new stroke patients were registered in four 12 month recruitment phases over the 30-year study period; 79% were NZ/European, 6% Māori, 8% Pacific people, and 7% were of Asian or other origin. Overall stroke incidence and 1-year mortality decreased by 23% (95% CI 5%-31%) and 62% (95% CI 36%-86%), respectively, from 1981 to 2012. Whilst stroke incidence and mortality declined across all groups in NZ from 1991, Māori and Pacific groups had the slowest rate of decline and continue to experience stroke at a significantly younger age (mean ages 60 and 62 years, respectively) compared with NZ/Europeans (mean age 75 years). There was also a decline in 28-day stroke case fatality (overall by 14%, 95% CI 11%-17%) across all ethnic groups from 1981 to 2012. However, there were significant increases in the frequencies of pre-morbid hypertension, myocardial infarction, and diabetes mellitus, but a reduction in frequency of current smoking among stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this unique temporal series of studies spanning 30 years, stroke incidence, early case-fatality and 1-year mortality have declined, but ethnic disparities in risk and outcome for stroke persisted suggesting that primary stroke prevention remains crucial to reducing the burden of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Despite several studies and models, much remains unclear about how the human basal ganglia operate. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for complicated Parkinson's disease, but how DBS acts also remains unknown. The clinical benefit of DBS at frequencies >100 Hz suggests the possible importance of neural rhythms operating at frequencies higher than the range normally considered for basal ganglia processing (<100 Hz). The electrodes implanted for DBS also offer the opportunity to record neural activity from the human basal ganglia. This study aimed to assess whether oscillations at frequencies >100 Hz operate in the human STN. While recording local field potentials from the STN of nine patients with Parkinson's disease through DBS electrodes, we found a dopamine- and movement-dependent 300-Hz rhythm. At rest, and in the absence of dopaminergic medication, in most cases (eight out of 11 nuclei) the 100-1000 Hz band showed no consistent rhythm. Levodopa administration elicited (or markedly increased) a 300-Hz rhythm at rest [(mean +/- SD) central frequency: 319 +/- 33 Hz; bandwidth: 72 +/- 21 Hz; power increase (after medication - before medication)/before medication: 1.30 +/- 1.25; n = 11, P = 0.00098]. The 300-Hz rhythm was also increased by apomorphine, but not by orphenadrine. The 300-Hz rhythm was modulated by voluntary movement. Before levodopa administration, movement-related power increase in the 300-Hz rhythm was variably present in different subjects, whereas after levodopa it became a robust phenomenon [before 0.014 +/- 0.014 arbitrary units (AU), after 0.178 +/- 0.339 AU; n = 8, P = 0.0078]. The dopamine-dependent 300-Hz rhythm probably reflects a bistable compound nuclear activity and supports high-resolution information processing in the basal ganglia circuit. An absent 300-Hz subthalamic rhythm could be a pathophysiological clue in Parkinson's disease. The 300-Hz rhythm also provides the rationale for an excitatory--and not only inhibitory--interpretation of DBS mechanism of action in humans.",

Here we present a tree-ring δ18O-based precipitation reconstruction for the South American Altiplano for 1700–2013 C.E., derived from Polylepis tarapacana tree rings. This record explains 56% of December–March instrumental precipitation variability in the Altiplano. The tree-ring δ18O chronology shows interannual (2–5 years) and decadal (~11 years) oscillations that are remarkably consistent with periodicities observed in Altiplano precipitation, central tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, southern-tropical Andean ice core δ18O and tropical Pacific coral δ18O archives. These results demonstrate the value of annual-resolution tree-ring δ18O records to capture hydroclimate teleconnections and generate robust tropical climate reconstructions. This work contributes to a better understanding of global oxygen-isotope patterns, as well as atmospheric and oceanic processes across the tropics.",

The phenotypical findings of this syndrome are variable due to heterogenous aetiology. For that reason, the physician sometimes faces difficulty when making a definite diagnosis of OAVD. We reviewed the clinical and laboratory findings of 31 patients (15 boys and 16 girls) aged from 1 day to 16 years with the clinical diagnosis of GS. The characteristic features were pre-auricular skin tags (90%), microtia (52%), hemifacial microsomia (77%) and epibulbar dermoids (39%). Vertebral anomalies were noted in 70% of the patients. Cardiac malformations were found in 39% while a genitourinary anomaly was noted in 23% and various central nervous system malformations in 47%. There were 3 pregnancies following an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) technique among the 31 patients. Two patients with GS came from the same family. Their relatives had hydrocephaly, myelomeningocele and neural tube defects. It is known that some chromosomal aberrations are seen in GS. We performed chromosome analysis of 29 patients. Among these cases, only one patient with severe mental and motor retardation had a 47,XX,+der(22)t(11,22)(q23; q11 karyotype due to a maternal balanced translocation t(11;22)(q23;q11). This translocation was demonstrated in her sister, brother and maternal uncle. Additionally CATCH 22 analysis in 13 cases with OAVD with a CATCH 22 phenotype revealed no deletion. OAVD patients present with different morphologic features and systemic manifestations. A multidisciplinary approach should be undertaken by departments such as pediatric cardiology, audiology, ophthalmology and plastic surgery when evaluating patients with OAVD. Chromosome analysis should be performed in every patient with Goldenhar syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Methyl phosphite ((CH(3)O)P(H)(O)(2)(-); MeOPH) and methylethyl phosphate ((CH(3)O)P(OCH(2)CH(3))(O)(2)(-); MEP) are two members of a class of anionic ligands whose (31)P T(2) relaxation rates are remarkably sensitive to paramagnetic metal ions. The temperature dependence of the (31)P NMR line broadenings caused by the Mn(H(2)O)(6)(2+) ion and a water-soluble manganese(III) porphyrin (Mn(III)TMPyP(5+)) indicates that the extent of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement is a measure of the rate at which the anionic probes come into physical contact with the paramagnetic center (i.e., enter the inner coordination shell); that is, piDeltanu(par) = k(assn)[M], where Deltanu(par) is the difference between the line widths of the resonance in paramagnetic and diamagnetic solutions, and k(assn) is the second-order rate constant for association of the phosphorus ligand with the metal, M. Comparison of the (31)P T(1) and T(2) relaxation enhancements shows that rapid T(2) relaxation by the metal ion is caused by scalar interaction with the electronic spin. Relaxation of the phosphorus-bound proton of MeOPH ((1)H-P) by Mn(III)TMPyP(5+) displayed intermediate exchange kinetics over much of the observable temperature range. The field strength dependence of (1)H-P T(2) enhancement and the independence of the (31)P T(2) support these assertions. As in the case of the (31)P T(2), the (1)H-P T(2) relaxation enhancement results from scalar interaction with the electronic spin. The scalar coupling interpretation of the NMR data is supported by a pulsed EPR study of the interactions of Mn(H(2)O)(6)(2+) with the P-deuterated analogue of methyl phosphite, CH(3)OP((2)H)(O)(2)(-). The electron to (31)P and (2)H nuclear scalar coupling constants were found to be 4.6 and 0.10 MHz, respectively. In contrast, the effects of paramagnetic ions on the methoxy and ethoxy (1)H resonances of MeOPH and MEP are weak, and the evidence suggests that relaxation of these nuclei occurs by a dipolar mechanism. The wide variation in the relaxation sensitivities of the (1)H and (31)P nuclei of MeOPH and MEP permits us to study how differences in the strengths of the interactions between an observed nucleus and a paramagnetic center affect NMR T(2) relaxations. We propose that these anion ligand probes may be used to study ligand-exchange reactivities of manganese complexes without requiring variable temperature studies. The (31)P T(2) is determined by chemical association kinetics when the following condition is met: (T(2M,P)/T(2M,H))(Deltanu(P)/Deltanu(HP) - 1) < 0.2 where T(2M,P) and T(2M,H) are the transverse relaxation times of the (31)P and (1)H nuclei when the probe is bound to the metal, and Deltanu(P) and Deltanu(HP) are the paramagnetic line broadenings of the (31)P and (1)H-P nuclei, respectively. We assert that the ratio T(2M,P)/T(2M,H) can be estimated for a general metal complex using the results of EPR and NMR experiments.",

In this study we aim to examine the effect of mental health on outcomes following burns less than 20% total body surface area (%TBSA).

Mean total body surface area burn (TBSA) was 6.72±5.5%, and 6.14% had inhalation injury. In this study population 27.6% had drug dependence, and 15.4% had major psychiatric illness. The mean length of stay was 11.4±16.7 days, and 12 patients (1.25%) died. In examining the effects of major psychiatric illness, there was no difference in age (46.4 vs. 46.2 years, p=0.87), no difference in %TBSA (6.30% vs. 6.77%, p=0.328). Length of stay (LOS) (15.2 vs. 10.7 days, p=0.0009) and LOS/TBSA (4.03 vs. 2.90 days, p = 0.03) were increased in patients with major psychiatric illness. There was no difference in the rate of readmissions (8.11% vs. 6.56%, p=0.49). In examining the effects of drug dependence, patients were younger (40.4 vs. 48.4 years, p&amp;lt; 0.0001), suffered a larger %TBSA (7.70% vs. 6.31%, p=0.0008), and had a longer length of stay (13.7 vs. 10.5 days, p=0.04).

Major psychiatric illness does not affect burn size but does increase length of stay. Drug dependence leads to larger burn size which secondarily increases length of stay. Based on these increases in length of stay, it is likely that hospital costs are also higher for these patients. Further work must be done to mitigate the effects of mental illness on burn outcomes, even in small burns.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Applicability of Research to Practice</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Many burn patients have mental health problems.

Mean litter size was 4.1 and did not differ among age classes. The female generation length of 4.49 years was 2.4 times the life expectancy and the median survivorship. The net reproductive rate (R(o)) was 0.67, yet the population did not continually decline; adjustments to these data increased R(o) to 0.85. Reproductive values (V(x)) were approximately equal across the reproductive age classes. The polygynous mating system is both cause and effect of the demography. Marmot population size is affected by weather factors that influence reproduction and survival, by predation, and by movement into and out of the study area.",

(1995) FEBS Lett. 360, 251-254]. Here we report that the photosystem II 33 kDa extrinsic protein is fully removed by HgCl(2) added at micromolar and higher concentrations (0.25, 20, and 50 microM), with the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic proteins and other intrinsic proteins remaining bound to the reaction center. The data presented here put in doubt the \"regulatory cap\" model of PS II, which follows the OEC-33 kDa-23 kDa-17 kDa binding order, as these results directly demonstrate that the 33 kDa protein can be removed without affecting the binding of the 23 and 17 kDa proteins to the intrinsic subunits of PS II. This suggests that each extrinsic protein may possess its own binding site on PS II. A possible mechanism for HgCl(2) upon the release of the 33 kDa protein is discussed.",

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In this longitudinal study, 1,139 participants from the OAI, a multi-center, observational study of the evolution of knee OA, were selected using the following inclusion criteria: right knee Kellgren Lawrence (KL) score (radiographic classification of OA severity) 0-2 indicating no to mild radiographic OA at baseline, no history of rheumatoid arthritis at baseline, available blood pressure measurements at baseline, available T2 measurements in at least three knee compartments at baseline and 48-month follow-up. Linear regression models were performed using standardized values for SBP, DBP and PP as primary predictors and change in cartilage T2 over 48 months, a measure of cartilage matrix quality and degeneration, as the primary outcome. PP was defined as SBP minus DBP. Change in superficial layer and deep layer cartilage T2, which reflect differences in the laminar organization of knee cartilage T2, were also included as outcomes. Statistical models were adjusted for common risk factors for knee OA (baseline age, sex, BMI, KL score) as well as number of currently used anti-hypertensive medications (AHM) reported at baseline. We included AHMs whose primary indication was the treatment of hypertension including beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), thiazides, chlorthalidone, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) and aliskiren. All predictors, outcomes and covariates (except sex) were analyzed as continuous variables. We included interaction terms in the models to evaluate whether the covariates (age, sex, BMI, KL score, number of AHMs) modified the association of SBP, DBP and PP with cartilage T2. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The average age of all study participants was 58.8 years (SD ± 8.6) with a higher proportion of men (59.4%), average body mass index (BMI) was 28.3 (SD ± 4.5), average SBP was 122.4 (SD ± 15.4) mmHg, average DBP was 75.5 (SD ± 9.6) mmHg and 469 (38.1%) study participants were taking at least one AHM. Higher baseline DBP was significantly associated with a faster increase in global T2 (0.22 [0.10,0.35], P &lt; 0.001), global deep layer T2 (0.20 [0.03,0.36], P &lt; 0.022) and global superficial layer T2 (0.39 [0.20,0.58], P &lt; 0.001). These associations were significant in both unadjusted and the models adjusted for age, sex, BMI and KL score. No significant associations were found between SBP or PP and cartilage T2 and no significant interactions were found between SBP, DBP, PP and the covariates. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Higher baseline DBP was associated with a faster increase in knee cartilage T2, suggesting accelerated cartilage degeneration. This association was stronger for the superficial layer of knee cartilage T2 compared to the deep layer. Although further basic mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of this relationship, these results suggest lowering DBP may influence knee OA.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Earlier pubertal timing has been associated with risk for depression, particularly in girls (e.g., Keenan etal., 2014). Evidence suggests pubertal timing in girls also relates to alterations in the microstructural properties of brain white matter tracts in late adolescence (Chahal etal., 2018), and structural connectivity of cingulate and frontal regions (Chahal etal., in prep), though differences in pubertal development in both boys and girls have not been examined in the context of brain functional connectivity (FC). Individual differences in the course of puberty may have enduring effects on functional coupling among brain regions that may contribute to the risk for psychopathology. To address this question, we explored the relation between pubertal timing and tempo with depression symptoms (age 16). Then, we examined whether brain network FC (age 16) associates with pubertal indices and predicts concurrent and later depressive symptoms (age 18). METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Sixty-eight adolescents (37 females) completed the Mini-Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ; Clark &amp; Watson, 1995) at ages 14-18. Gompertz growth curve modelling of pubertal development (age 10-15; Waves 1-6) was used to estimate pubertal timing and tempo per individual, separately for males and females (e.g., Chahal etal., 2018). Resting-state MRI data (age 16) were parcellated into 264 cortical and subcortical regions to create region-to-region FC matrices based on correlations of time-series. Individual matrices were fed to the GraphVar program (Kruschwitz etal., 2015) to assess the interaction of pubertal timing and pubertal tempo with functional network connectivity using Network-based statistic (NBS; Zalesky etal., 2010). Subnetworks showing alterations in relation to pubertal timing and tempo were then examined in association with concurrent (age 16) symptoms and used to predict future depressive symptoms (age 18). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In all youth, earlier pubertal timing was associated with higher depressive symptoms at age 16 (p&lt;.018). This association was stronger in girls with slower pubertal tempo (p&lt;.039). Interregional connectivity analyses revealed that the interaction of earlier pubertal timing and slower tempo was associated with lower FC between the left cingulate gyrus and right precuneus (p&lt;.0001), regions implicated in emotion processing (i.e., Affective Processing Network) and self-referential thinking (i.e., Default Mode Network). FC of the three other emotion- and self-referential processing network regions (i.g., left insula, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus) was lower in youth with greater age 16 depressive symptoms (p&lt;.0001). Finally, lower FC of of the left and right inferior parietal lobule predicted greater depressive symptoms at age 18 (p&lt;.0001). In summary, FC of overlapping affective and default mode network areas was related to earlier pubertal timing and higher concurrent and future depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These findings demonstrate individual differences in pubertal maturation are associated with depressive symptoms and differences in brain connectivity in mid-adolescence. Early pubertal development was associated with greater depression symptoms and lower FC of brain regions involved in emotion regulation and self-referential processing. Further, FC between these regions predicted higher depression symptoms two years later. These neurobiological mechanisms may, in part, underlie the link between off-time pubertal development and the risk for depression. These findings also have important implications for precision psychiatry, as we show that a risk-factor of depression (early pubertal timing) may manifest in developing neurobiology in region-specific ways. Previous network models of depression (e.g., Li etal., 2018) implicated affective network connectivity in sustained negative mood and the default mode/ self-referential network in rumination. Other networks implicated in these past models include the reward network, which may be involved in anhedonia and loss of pleasure. Our study only found associations between affective and self-referential regional connectivity, pubertal maturation, and depression, suggesting that pubertal risk factors may relate more closely with emotion-regulation and self-referential processing deficits.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Herschel Space Observatory photometry and extensive multiwavelength follow-up have revealed that the powerful radio galaxy (PRG) 3C 220.3 at z = 0.685 acts as a gravitational lens for a background submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z = 2.221. At an observed wavelength of 1 mm, the SMG is lensed into three distinct images. In the observed near infrared, these images are connected by an arc of 1″.8 radius forming an Einstein half-ring centered near the radio galaxy. In visible light, only the arc is apparent. 3C 220.3 is the only known instance of strong galaxy-scale lensing by a PRG not located in a galaxy cluster and therefore it offers the potential to probe the dark matter content of the radio galaxy host. Lens modeling rejects a single lens, but two lenses centered on the radio galaxy host A and a companion B, separated by 1″.5, provide a fit consistent with all data and reveal faint candidates for the predicted fourth and fifth images. The model does not require an extended common dark matter halo, consistent with the absence of extended bright X-ray emission on our Chandra image. The projected dark matter fractions within the Einstein radii of A (1″.02) and B (0″.61) are about 0.4 ± 0.3 and 0.55 ± 0.3. The mass to i-band light ratios of A and B, , appear comparable to those of radio-quiet lensing galaxies at the same redshift in the CfA-Arizona Space Telescope LEns Survey, Lenses Structure and Dynamics, and Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey samples. The lensed SMG is extremely bright with observed f(250 μm) = 440 mJy owing to a magnification factor μ 10. The SMG spectrum shows luminous, narrow C IV λ1549 Å emission, revealing that the SMG houses a hidden quasar in addition to a violent starburst. Multicolor image reconstruction of the SMG indicates a bipolar morphology of the emitted ultraviolet (UV) light suggestive of cones through which UV light escapes a dust-enshrouded nucleus. © 2014.

Using two different TBM designs (averaging individual differences versus aligning group average templates), we compared the anatomical distribution of brain atrophy in 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 40 healthy elderly controls, and 40 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a condition conferring increased risk for AD. We created an unbiased geometrical average image template for each of the three groups, which were matched for sex and age (mean age: 76.1 years+/-7.7 SD). We warped each individual brain image (N=120) to the control group average template to create Jacobian maps, which show the local expansion or compression factor at each point in the image, reflecting individual volumetric differences. Statistical maps of group differences revealed widespread medial temporal and limbic atrophy in AD, with a lesser, more restricted distribution in MCI. Atrophy and CSF space expansion both correlated strongly with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Using cumulative p-value plots, we investigated how detection sensitivity was influenced by the sample size, the choice of search region (whole brain, temporal lobe, hippocampus), the initial linear registration method (9- versus 12-parameter), and the type of TBM design. In the future, TBM may help to (1) identify factors that resist or accelerate the disease process, and (2) measure disease burden in treatment trials.",

MTA > or = 2 showed a trend for greater left sided hippocampal atrophy versus MTA < 2 groups at baseline (P(corrected) = 0.08). Higher MTA scores were associated with progressive atrophy of the subiculum and the CA1-3 subregions. The MTA < 2 group demonstrated significant bilateral atrophy progression at follow-up (left P(corrected) = 0.008; right P(corrected) = 0.05). Relative to MTA < 2 nonconverters, MTA < 2 converters showed further involvement of the subiculum and CA1 and additional involvement of CA2-3 at follow-up. Right CA1 atrophy was significantly associated with conversion to dementia (for 1 mm greater right CA1 radial distance subjects had 50% reduced hazard for conversion). Greater CA1 and subicular atrophy can be demonstrated early and is predictive of future conversion to AD, whereas CA2-3 involvement becomes more evident as the disease progresses.",

We find good agreement for the total ejecta mass and for the velocity distribution of the ejecta between simulations and experiments, validating the numerical model and method for predicting the outcomes of low-velocity impacts into granular media. In addition, we analyzed the influences of granular bed size, solid volume fraction and particle density using the DEM and present the results of these simulations that could not readily be reproduced experimentally.

Good agreement of the particle masses in the cup before and after penetration can be found in the simulations and experiments. The effects of particle length (Lp), friction coefficient, and particle configuration on the penetration depth of the impactor, ejecta mass, and solid volume fraction describing the response of the granular bed are discussed. The penetration depth is negatively correlated with Lp as the corresponding solid volume fraction of the granular bed decreases. A smaller friction coefficient leads to a larger penetration depth of the impactor and more ejection of particles. When the impactor is penetrating the Lp = 10 mm elongated particles, the penetration depth is negatively correlated to the order parameter and solid volume fraction.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A diffusion gradient was inserted in a SS 3DPR pulse sequence. The acquisition was synchronized to the cardiac cycle, linear phase errors were corrected along the readout direction, and each projection was weighted by measures of consistency with other data. A new iterative parallel imaging reconstruction method was also implemented for removing off-resonance and undersampling artifacts simultaneously. RESULTS: The contrast and appearance of both the fractional anisotropy and eigenvector color maps were substantially improved after all correction techniques were applied. True 3D DTI datasets were obtained in vivo over the whole brain (240 mm field of view in all directions) with 1.87 mm isotropic spatial resolution, six diffusion encoding directions in under 19 minutes. CONCLUSION: A true 3D DTI pulse sequence with high isotropic spatial resolution was developed for whole brain imaging in under 20 minutes. To minimize the effects of brain motion, a cardiac synchronized, multiecho, DW-SSFP pulse sequence was implemented. Motion artifacts were further reduced by a combination of linear phase correction, corrupt projection detection and rejection, sampling density reweighting, and parallel imaging reconstruction. The combination of these methods greatly improved the quality of 3D DTI in the brain.",

The o v erall scatter in [Fe/H] within a galaxy decreased with time until 7 Gyr ago, after which it increased to today: This arises from a competition between a reduction of azimuthal scatter and a steepening of the radial gradient in abundance o v er time. The radial gradient is generally ne gativ e, and it steepened o v er time from an initially flat gradient 12 Gyr ago. The strength of the present-day abundance gradient does not correlate with when the disc 'settled'; instead, it best correlates with the radial velocity dispersion within the galaxy. The strength of azimuthal variation is nearly independent of radius, and the 360 deg scatter decreased over time, from 0 . 17 dex at t lb = 11 . 6 Gyr to 0 . 04 dex at present-day . Consequently , stars at t lb 8 Gyr formed in a disc with primarily azimuthal scatter in abundances. All stars formed in a vertically homogeneous disc, [Fe/H] 0 . 02 dex within 1 kpc of the galactic mid-plane, with the exception of the young stars in the inner 4 kpc at z 0. These results generally agree with our previous analysis of gas-phase elemental abundances, which reinforces the importance of cosmological disc evolution and azimuthal scatter in the context of stellar chemical tagging. We provide analytic fits to our results for use in chemical-Tagging analyses.",

The model simultaneously tracks fine particle concentrations (PM2.5), inhalable particle concentrations (PM10), ozone, and other gaseous pollutant concentrations yielding a tool that can be used to study the control of all of the regulated contaminants in the atmosphere within a single unified framework. Model predictions identify geographical areas that are influenced by PM2.5 associated with crustal material other than paved road dust, paved road dust, diesel engines, food cooking, noncatalyst equipped gasoline engines, catalyst-equipped gasoline engines, combustion of high sulfur-content fuel, other primary particle sources, sea salt, and marine background sulfate particles. The contribution that each of these source types makes to regional fine particle concentrations is distinct, reflecting the unique chemical composition, spatial distribution, and diurnal trends of primary emissions. The single largest contribution to regional PM2.5 in the South Coast Air Basin surrounding Los Angeles is associated with the accumulation of secondary ammonium nitrate on background marine sulfate particles. This pattern indicates that control of PM2.5 concentrations in Los Angeles must be accomplished through a program that includes both reductions in the emissions of gaseous precursors of secondary PM2.5 as well as control of primary particle emissions.",

    "abstract": "Upwelling can impact water quality dynamics in stratified water bodies. Conceptual models generally classify the upwelling response to winds in lakes into either a non-rotational (2D, closed-basin) model or a rotational (coastal upwelling) counterpart. The non-rotational model is broadly applied in rotationally influenced lakes. The upwelling response to winds in stratified lakes may exhibit elements of both conceptual models. Here, we present the results of simulations with an accurate three-dimensional numerical model of a lake of moderate size (Lake Tahoe, California–Nevada, USA), and focus our analyses on addressing the influence of the Coriolis force during the upwelling setup and relaxation phases. Upwelling was observed at the upwind boundary as well as along the coast to the left of the mean wind direction due to Ekman-driven divergence. On the downwind shoreline, where downwelling occurs, alongshore currents appeared in response to wind forcing. Following the relaxation of the wind, our simulations reveal, for the first time, the existence of powerful cyclonic alongshore currents in lakes of moderate size, which are found to be in quasi-geostrophic balance. These currents followed the characteristics of coastal jets often observed in large lakes and the coastal ocean. Our work leads us to conclude that upwelling setup in lakes with length scales ≈20 km and Burger numbers S < 1, exhibits a combination of dynamics predicted by both the non-rotational, 2D, closed basin model, and the rotational coastal-upwelling conceptual model.",

Gas within 1 kpc of the disc mid-plane is vertically homogeneous to ≲ 0.008 dex at all z ≤ 1.5. We find negative radial gradients (metallicity decreases with galactocentric radius) at all times, which steepen over time from -0.01 dex kpc-1 at z = 1 (tlookback} = 7.8 Gyr) to -0.03 dex kpc-1 at z = 0, and which broadly agree with observations of the MW, M31, and nearby MW/M31-mass galaxies. Azimuthal variations at fixed radius are typically 0.14 dex at z = 1, reducing to 0.05 dex at z = 0. Thus, over time radial gradients become steeper while azimuthal variations become weaker (more homogeneous). As a result, azimuthal variations were larger than radial variations at z ≥ 0.8 (tlookback ≳ 6.9 Gyr). Furthermore, elemental abundances are measurably homogeneous (to ≤0.05 dex) across a radial range of Δ R ≈ 3.5 kpc at z ≥ 1 and Δ R ≈ 1.7 kpc at z = 0. We also measure full distributions of elemental abundances, finding typically negatively skewed normal distributions at z ≥ 1 that evolve to typically Gaussian distributions by z = 0. Our results on gas abundances inform the initial conditions for stars, including the spatial and temporal scales for applying chemical tagging to understand stellar birth in the MW.",

The point spread functions (PSFs) for breath-held He-3 MRI using multiple half-echo trajectories were evaluated using simulations to predict the effects of T(2)* and gas diffusion on image quality. Results from PSF simulations were consistent with imaging results in volunteer studies showing improved image quality with increasing number of echoes using up to 8 half-echoes. The 8-half-echo acquisition is shown to accommodate lost breath-holds as short as 6 sec using a retrospective reconstruction at reduced resolution and also to allow reduced breath-hold time compared with an equivalent Cartesian trajectory. Furthermore, preliminary results from a 3D dynamic inhalation-exhalation maneuver are demonstrated using the 8-half-echo trajectory.

In these networks, when only a few interconnected NWs were measured, multiple MR kinks and local minima were observed, including a significant minimum at a positive field during the descending field sweep. Micromagnetic simulations showed that this unusual feature was due to domain wall (DW) pinning at the NW intersections, which was confirmed by off-axis electron holography imaging. In a complex network with many intersections, sequential switching of nanowire sections separated by interconnects was observed, along with stochastic characteristics. The pinning/depinning of the DWs can be further controlled by the driving current density. These results illustrate the promise of such interconnected networks as integrated multistate memristors.",

This study integrates corrosion expansion and bond degradation models into a discrete analysis framework, 3D RBSM (Rigid Body Spring Model), to simulate post-corrosion loss of tension stiffening. Uniaxial tensile loading is applied to reinforced concrete models with different degrees of corrosion to obtain plots of load versus average strain and surface cracking patterns. Simulated surface cracking patterns due to corrosion and uniaxial loading in uncorroded and corroded models are similar to experimental results. As the degree of corrosion increases, the number of transverse cracks on the concrete surface decrease and the load at first cracking also decreases. Further, internal stress and bond stress investigation directly illustrate the decrease in stress transfer from reinforcing bar to concrete due to corrosion.",

Growing the same varieties under these altered climatic conditions often requires mitigation strategies, but quantitative, generalized understanding of the impacts of such strategies can be difficult or time consuming to determine through field trials. This work developed and validated a detailed three-dimensional (3D) model of grape berry temperature that could fully resolve spatial and temporal heterogeneity in berry temperature, and ultimately predict the impacts of potential high berry temperature mitigation strategies such as the use of alternative trellis systems. A novel experimental data set was generated in which the temperature of exposed grape berry clusters was measured with thermocouples at four field sites with different trellis systems, topography, and climate. Experimental measurements indicated that the temperature of shaded berries closely followed the ambient air temperature, but intermittent periods of direct solar radiation could generate berry temperatures in excess of 10∘C above ambient. Validation results indicated that by accurately representing the 3D vine structure, the model was able to closely replicate rapid spatial and temporal fluctuations in berry temperature. Including berry heat storage in the model reduced the errors by dampening extreme temporal swings in berry temperature.",

A series of 2D radiographs were taken as the cell dropped in temperature capturing the condensation and redistribution of flow field and gas diffusion layer (GDL) water. Immediately after this, 3D tomography was conducted while the cell remained at -5 °C. The image data was reconstructed into a 3D model in order to highlight regions where water/ice formations occur. The tomography results show where ice forms within the flow field and which regions are subject to blockages. Ice is observed predominately under channel areas due to water rejection by the GDL. The cathode side channel exit region displays higher ice content which correlates with elevated saturation levels from reaction water production during operation. Larger ice formations reside in the lower region of the flow field due to gravity. These blockages may pose significant issues to cold start of the cell as well as highlight potential drawbacks to shorter purge durations. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

    "abstract": "Design of column-supported embankments (CSE) requires the evaluation of global stability using the conventional limit equilibrium method (LEM). Yet, for CSEs using unreinforced concrete columns and load transferring geogrids, the failure mechanisms and corresponding soil-structure interactions are not well understood. There is increasing evidence pointing to large bending moments in columns and failure of columns in flexure, as opposed to a failure by shear as assumed in limit equilibrium analyses. In response to these design uncertainties, the failure height, failure mode, and deformations of eight column-supported embankment scenarios were investigated using three-dimensional (3D) numerical analyses. For the same embankment scenarios at failure height, factors of safety (FS) were then calculated using the two-dimensional (2D) LEM for investigating its applicability in evaluating global stability of CSEs. The 3D numerical analyses examined CSE stability for the limiting conditions at undrained end-of-construction and after long-term dissipation of excess pore water pressures. The numerical model included representations of flexural tensile failure in the concrete columns and tensile failure in the geosynthetic reinforcement. Scenarios consisted of a base case with typical concrete column design, five single-parameter variations using base case conditions, and two multiparameter variations using base case conditions. The undrained condition was the most critical, and two failure modes were found: (1) multisurface shearing in the embankment coupled with bending failure of columns and near-circular shear failure in the clay, and (2) multisurface shearing in the embankment coupled with bending failure of columns and shearing in the upper portion of the soft foundation clay. Both failure modes were accompanied by a rupture of the geosynthetic when included in the load transfer platform. Soil-column interactions were complex, and many columns failed in bending at lower embankment heights than those that produced collapse. The factors of safety calculated using the LEM were overstated. This is because the LEM assumes failure by shear, which has limited applicability for examining the complex mechanisms by which CSEs fail. The practical implication is that the LEM should not be used for evaluating global stability of this system type and, by extension, other system types in which soil-structure interactions result in failures controlled by mechanisms other than shear.",

An undrained end-of-construction analysis is followed by a long-term dissipated analysis, in which all excess pore pressures generated in the undrained loading phase were manually dissipated for the calculation of long-term deformations. The two analyses examined limiting cases for lateral spreading, providing results that envelop case history recordings at the end of construction and 125 days after construction, respectively. Numerical calculations were performed for a unit cell and a half-embankment model. Calibration of large-deformation soil arching behavior in the embankment was achieved by reducing the Young's modulus and friction angle of loosened zones whose dimensions were modeled after bench-scale and field-scale tests. Numerical results are in good agreement with case history recordings for vertical load transfer, settlements, and lateral displacements. In addition, numerical results are provided for foundation incremental lateral earth pressure profiles, geogrid strains, column bending moment profiles, and column stresses due to combined effects of bending and axial loading so that they can be related to the fundamental aspects of lateral spreading resistance. The increment of lateral earth pressures in the foundation soil was largest at the undrained end-of-construction condition, geogrid strains were largest in the long-term dissipated condition, and column bending moments and column tensile stresses were very large in both scenarios. Furthermore, the geogrid contributions to increasing vertical load transfer to the columns and reducing lateral spreading of the embankment were insignificant, likely due to the subgrade support provided by the top coarse-grained fill layer in the foundation.",

The particle saltation theoretical/numerical model follows a Lagrangian approach, and addresses the motion of sediment particles in an open channel flow described by a logarithmic velocity profile. The model is validated with experimental data obtained from the literature. In order to evaluate the importance of the phenomenon, simulations with and without particle-particle collisions were carried out. Results for two different sediment concentrations are presented, namely 0. 13% and 2.33%. For each concentration of particles, three different flow intensities were considered, and trajectories of two different particle sizes, within the sand range were computed. Changes in particle rotation, particle velocity, and angle of trajectory before and after particle-particle collisions appear to be relatively important at lower shear stresses, whereas they decrease in significance with increasing flow intensities. Analyses of the evolution in time of the second order moment of particle location suggest that inter-particle collisions introduce transverse diffusion in saltating particles in the span-wise direction. © 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.",

Exosomes derived via Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (TEIR) as well as ultracentrifugation (UC) from the SKOV3 cell line were analyzed. Spectra of exosomes derived via TEIR are dominated by a signal characteristic for the TEIR kit that needs to be subtracted for all measurements. Differences in SERS spectra recorded at different times during the drying of the exosome solution are statistically analyzed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). At the beginning of the drying process, SERS spectra of exosomes exhibit peaks characteristic for both lipids and proteins. Later on during the drying process, new SERS peaks develop, suggesting that the initially intact exosome ruptures over time. This time-dependent evolution of SERS peaks enables analysis of exosomal membrane contents and the contents inside the exosomes.",

To evaluate the limitations and future implications of 3D printing in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies reviewed demonstrated 3D printing applications in surgical planning including accurate anatomic biomodels, surgical cutting guides in reconstruction, and patient-specific implants fabrication. 3D printing technology also offers access to well tolerated, reproducible, and high-fidelity/patient-specific models for surgical training. Emerging research in 3D biomaterial printing have led to the development of biocompatible scaffolds with potential for tissue regeneration in reconstruction cases involving significant tissue absence or loss. Major limitations of utilizing 3D printing technology include time and cost, which may be offset by decreased operating times and collaboration between departments to diffuse in-house printing costs SUMMARY: The current state of the literature shows promising results, but has not yet been validated by large studies or randomized controlled trials. Ultimately, further research and advancements in 3D printing technology should be supported as there is potential to improve resident training, patient care, and surgical outcomes.",

This is especially crucial for California’s almond orchards, which are the most N-hungry nut crop and require substantial N for high productivity. The current practices of uniform and extensive N application lead to N leaching into the groundwater, creating environmental hazards. Traditional remote sensing methods often rely on data-driven approaches that work well statistically (achieving a high R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> value) with one dataset but aren’t adaptable across different datasets. To create a more robust, data-driven model, one would typically need a vast and varied collection of datasets. Our goal, however, is to develop a more universally applicable model using smaller datasets, typical of commercial orchards, that can accurately estimate N content in tree canopies, regardless of differences in spatial, spectral, and temporal data. In this study, we investigate and evaluate multiple remote sensing approaches for estimating N concentration in Californian almonds, utilizing hyperspectral imaging at the canopy level. We assess various classical vegetation indices, machine learning models, and a physics-informed 3D radiative transfer model. While cross-validated results show comparable results for radiative transfer models and best-performing machine learning models, most single vegetation indices are not capable of exceeding the baseline model <jats:inline-formula>\n              <jats:tex-math>$$\\:f\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)=\\bar{y}$$</jats:tex-math>\n            </jats:inline-formula> and thus had R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> value less than 0. Despite being less commonly used, 3D radiative transfer modeling shows promise as a strong and adaptable method, producing results that are comparable to the best machine learning models.</jats:p>",

(iii) Uniqueness for projection tomography—Unique determination of an object of n 3 voxels from generic n projections or n + 1 coded diffraction patterns is proved. This approach of reducing 3D phase retrieval to the problem of (phase) projection tomography has the practical implication of enabling classification and alignment, when relative orientations are unknown, to be carried out in terms of (phase) projections, instead of diffraction patterns.

Curvature can be injected by carefully placing topological singularities in the otherwise regular weaving pattern.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast imaging technology plays an important role in breast cancer planning and treatment. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has become a trending issue in phantom constructions for medical applications, with its advantages of being customizable and cost-efficient. However, there is no current practice in the field of multi-purpose breast phantom for quality control (QC) in multi-modalities imaging. The purpose of this study was to fabricate a multi-purpose breast phantom with tissue-equivalent materials via a 3D printing technique for QC in multi-modalities imaging. METHODS: We used polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based materials and a 3D printing technique to construct a breast phantom. The phantom incorporates structures imaged in the female breast such as microcalcifications, fiber lesions, and tumors with different sizes. Moreover, the phantom was used to assess the sensitivity of lesion detection, depth resolution, and detectability thresholds with different imaging modalities. Phantom tissue equivalent properties were determined using computed tomography (CT) attenuation [Hounsfield unit (HU)] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxation times. RESULTS: The 3D-printed breast phantom had an average background value of 36.2 HU, which is close to that of glandular breast tissue (40 HU). T1 and T2 relaxation times had an average relaxation time of 206.81±17.50 and 20.22±5.74 ms, respectively. Mammographic imaging had improved detection of microcalcification compared with ultrasound and MRI with multiple sequences [T1WI, T2WI and short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR)]. Soft-tissue lesion detection and cylindrical tumor contrast were superior with mammography and MRI compared to ultrasound. Hemispherical tumor detection was similar regardless of the imaging modality used. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a multi-purpose breast phantom using a 3D printing technique and determined its value for multi-modal breast imaging studies.",

An example is the exact endoscopic placement of magnetic field traps for the targeting of therapeutic nanoparticles. Three-dimensional-printed human replicas may be used to overcome these pitfalls. METHODS: We developed a transparent method to fabricate a patient-specific replica, allowing for a broad scope of application. As an example, we then additively manufactured the relevant organs of a patient with locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We performed experimental design investigations for a magnetic field trap and explored the best fixation methods on an explanted porcine stomach wall. RESULTS: We describe in detail the eight-step development of a 3D replica from CT data. To guide further users in their decisions, a morphologic box was created. Endoscopies were performed on the replica and the resulting magnetic field was investigated. The best fixation method to hold the magnetic field traps stably in place was the fixation of loops at the stomach wall with endoscopic single-use clips. CONCLUSIONS: Using only open access software, the developed method may be used for a variety of cancer-related research questions. A detailed description of the workflow allows one to produce a 3D replica for research or training purposes at low costs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glycogen is a branched polysaccharide of glucose residues, consisting of α-1-4 glycosidic linkages with α-1-6 branches that together form multi-layered particles ranging in size from 30 nm to 300 nm. Glycogen spatial conformation and intracellular organization are highly regulated processes. Glycogen particles interact with their metabolizing enzymes and are associated with a variety of proteins that intervene in its biology, controlling its structure, particle size and sub-cellular distribution. The function of glycogen in adipose tissue is not well understood but appears to have a pivotal role as a regulatory mechanism informing the cells on substrate availability for triacylglycerol synthesis. To provide new molecular insights into the role of adipocyte glycogen we analyzed the glycogen-associated proteome from differentiated 3T3-L1-adipocytes. RESULTS: Glycogen particles from 3T3-L1-adipocytes were purified using a series of centrifugation steps followed by specific elution of glycogen bound proteins using α-1,4 glucose oligosaccharides, or maltodextrins, and tandem mass spectrometry. We identified regulatory proteins, 14-3-3 proteins, RACK1 and protein phosphatase 1 glycogen targeting subunit 3D. Evidence was also obtained for a regulated subcellular distribution of the glycogen particle: metabolic and mitochondrial proteins were abundant. Unlike the recently analyzed hepatic glycogen proteome, no endoplasmic proteins were detected, along with the recently described starch-binding domain protein 1. Other regulatory proteins which have previously been described as glycogen-associated proteins were not detected, including laforin, the AMPK beta-subunit and protein targeting to glycogen (PTG). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide new molecular insights into the regulation of glycogen-bound proteins that are associated with the maintenance, organization and localization of the adipocyte glycogen particle.",

    "abstract": "The surface forces apparatus was used to identify the molecular forces that control the interactions of monoclonal 4-4-20 antifluorescyl IgG Fab' fragments with fluorescein-presenting supported planar bilayers. At long range, the electrostatic force between oriented Fab' and fluorescein monolayers was controlled by the composition of the protein exterior surrounding the antigen-combining site rather than by the overall protein charge. The measured positive electrostatic potential of the Fab' monolayer at pH > pI(Fab') was consistent with the structure of the exposed Fab' surface in which a ring of positive charge at the mouth of the antigen-combining site dominates the local electrostatic surface properties. Substantial differences in the electrostatic forces measured with denatured Fab' further demonstrated that the measured electrostatic surface properties and the consequent long-range interaction forces are controlled by the protein surface composition. At short range, the strength of the Fab'-mediated adhesion was modulated not only by the length of the fluorescein tether but also by membrane hydration. Steric hydration barriers at the membrane surface reduced the adhesion strength in proportion to their range of influence. These results provide direct evidence that long-range protein interactions with immobilized ligands are controlled by both the protein and the membrane surface compositions, while short-range, specific binding is modulated by both the protein structure and the membrane interfacial properties.",

Survey data were collected from relatively large and ethnically diverse samples of elementary and high school-aged students in California. Results indicated that although elementary-grade 4-H members are not more interested in science than other youth, by high school, participation in 4-H is associated with a greater number of science classes and higher-level science coursework. These results suggest that the 4-H program may have the ability to influence science interest and participation in the long term among its members. © by Extension Journal, Inc.",

Using 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP, 1), a compound isolated from Ruta graveolens, as a template we previously synthesized 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (PAP-1, 2) which inhibits Kv1.3 with an IC(50) of 2nM. Since PAP-1 is more than 1000-fold more potent than 5-MOP, we here investigated whether attaching a 4-phenoxybutoxy side chain to other heterocyclic systems would also produce potent Kv1.3 blockers. While 4-phenoxybutoxy-substituted quinolines, quinazolines and phenanthrenes were inactive, 4-phenoxybutoxy-substituted quinolinones, furoquinolines, coumarins or furochromones inhibited Kv1.3 with IC(50)s of 150 nM to 10 microM in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. Our most potent new compound is 4-(4-phenoxybutoxy)-7H-furo[3,2-g]chromene-7-thione (73, IC(50) 17 nM), in which the carbonyl oxygen of PAP-1 is replaced by sulfur. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the psoralen system is a crucial part of the pharmacophore of phenoxyalkoxypsoralen-type Kv1.3 blockers.",

    "abstract": "Pain arising from trigeminal systems such as headache is common, debilitating, and current treatments (e.g., sumatriptan) are limited. New treatments that target novel mechanisms of action may be required to innovate both short- and long-term pain therapy. Fatty acid amide hydrolase and soluble epoxide hydrolase are two pain-related enzymes that regulate pain and inflammation via independent pathways. We have previously demonstrated that simultaneous inhibition of these enzymes using a novel dual inhibitor alleviates acute inflammatory pain in the hindpaw and does not depress wheel running in rats. Here, we expanded on these findings and performed structure-activity relationships of our lead compound, the 4-phenyl-thiazole-based dual inhibitor SW-17, to generate 18 analogs and tested them for their inhibition at both enzymes. Conversion of the sulfonamide group to a tertiary amine led to a general decrease in the potency for the sEH enzyme, while this change was well-tolerated at the FAAH enzyme yielding several strong inhibitors. Six selected inhibitors were evaluated in mouse and rat sEH inhibition assays and results showed a species difference, i.e. 4-phenyl-thiazole-based analogs are significantly less or not active in mouse sEH compared to human and rat enzymes. The most potent inhibitor, SW-17, was evaluated in a plasma stability assay in human and rat plasma and showed moderate stability. However, SW-17 did not alleviate orofacial inflammatory pain in female rats compared to the traditional anti-migraine agent sumatriptan. Although modification of 4-phenyl-thiazole-based dual inhibitor SW-17 changes potencies at both FAAH and sEH, these approaches may not produce antinociception against trigeminal pain. Key Words: polypharmacology, formalin, inflammation, enzyme inhibition, structure-activity relationship studies.",

Transmission lines are used to realize the power matching networks at the input, output, and between the stages. Based on foundry-provided models, extensive electromagnetic simulations with Momentum® (a 2.5D simulator by Agilent) are performed on transmission lines, capacitors and I/O pads to model the behavior of the circuit at mm-wave frequencies. Furthermore, body biasing is used as a technique to control gain variability, linearity performance, and input matching of the designed LNA. Post-layout simulation results show that the LNA achieves a maximum gain of 21.3 dB at 60 GHz while consuming 20 mW from a 1.2 V supply. By changing the body bias voltage of the transistors in the two intermediate stages, the overall gain varies from 14 to 21.3 dB providing more than 7 dB of gain range. Adjusting the body biasing of the transistors in the last stage, results in a maximum IIP3 of more than 2 dBm for the overall amplifier. Also, the input return loss of the LNA is controlled by changing the bulk voltage of the input transistor in the first stage.",

An abrupt increase in pCO2 in the Early Permian is followed by a decrease prior to the Permo-Triassic boundary. Carbon dioxide levels increase through the Triassic to approx 3000 ppmV, a level maintained through the Jurassic period. Levels lowered through the Cretaceous, dropping to less than 1000 ppmV prior to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.

The central hypothesis is that CAFEX manipulates the immune response to allow immunoevasion and glycomic approaches can identify the signaling factors involved. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from primary head and neck tumors, expanded, characterized and cryopreserved prior to experimentation and isolation of CAFEX. Sialoglycan expression was determined using lectin-specific staining of cells and bead-captured CAFEX in combination with flow cytometry analysis. Siglec expression and expression of M2-macrophage markers were also determined by flow cytometry analysis and cytokine bead arrays. Inhibition studies involved either the enzymatic removal of cell-surface sialoglycans or alternatively, a specific small molecule analog inhibitor of sialoglycan transferases. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Both CAFs and CAFEX expressed abundant levels of cell-surface sialoglycans. CAFEX induced an M2-macrophage phenotype in primary monocytes, based on surface marker expression and cytokine secretion profiles. The induction of the M2 phenotype in macrophages was attenuated upon the removal of sialoglycans from the surface of CAFEX either by enzymatic removal or via a small molecule inhibitor. CAFEX were also able to directly bind members of the Siglec family, which are sialoglycan specific lectin receptors expressed on immune cells, including macrophages. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these studies suggest that surface presentation of sialoglycans by CAFEX may induce an immunosuppressive phenotype in monocytes/macrophages. Consequently, this may be a novel mechanism by which cells within the tumor bed facilitate immunoevasion during tumor progression.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Access to biostatistics expertise is essential for a successful clinical and translational research program. However, demand for statistical support at academic research centers can strain the capacity of biostatistics units. Our objective was to efficiently increase access to statistical expertise. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In cooperation with the Cancer Center Biostatistics Shared Resource, we replaced an informal 1-hour drop-in consultation program with structured office hours to provide statistical support to clinical and translational researchers at the University of California, Davis Medical Center. We doubled office hours to 2 hours per week and established six 20-minute appointments. Two Ph.D. level statisticians staff office hours. Researchers schedule appointments through Acuity Scheduling, a free on-line resource. Availability of the service is advertised monthly by sending an informational flyer to various university listservs. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Prior to implementing the program in 2014, we averaged 91 office hour consults per year. Subsequently, consultations jumped to 171 in 2014 and have averaged 150 per year since then. Office hours attract students, residents, staff and faculty from a wide range of disciplines including the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Veterinary Medicine and basic science departments. Project types span the clinical and translational spectrum covering lab, animal, clinical and population-level studies. Most consults related to data analysis and interpretation (57%) followed by sample size calculations/study design (29%) and response to reviewers (4%), with general statistical advice as the remainder. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: With 6 micro-consults per week, we can meet with many investigators and triage their statistical support needs. This program has proved very popular and was highly rated in a recent user survey, with several investigators noting that the consults facilitated successful publications and proposals.</jats:p>",

In the adult center, there was increase from 414 total admissions from fiscal year 2019 (7/2018-6/2019) of 414 to 495 for fiscal year 2020 (7/2019-6/2020). The average daily census also increased from 18.33 to 18.36 during the same period. The monthly number of burn admissions increased from 38.5/month for the last six months of 2019 to 44/month for the first six months of 2020. The admission rate continued in July (41) and August (47). In the first 8 months of 2020, there were 356 admissions with a mean TBSA of 11.3%. There were many large burns admitted in late summer. The mean TBSA of the 12 bed ICU on September 11, 2020 was 60.6% (range 25–85%). In the pediatric unit, there were 174 admissions through July 2020, a 6% increase from the preceding same period.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Knocking down the inflammatory response following joint trauma may halt the cytokine cascade and prevent the resulting cyclic degradation of articular cartilage. MK2 inhibiting (MK2i) peptides are an emerging and promising class of pharmaceutical to treat post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA); however, these peptides are susceptible to proteolytic degradation in the extracellular space. Our objective is to encapsulate MK2i in thermoresponsive hollow nanoparticles (hNPs) to knockdown the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to prevent the cyclic degradation of articular cartilage. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: <jats:italic>NP Synthesis:</jats:italic> N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAm) cores was initiated by potassium persulfate (KPS) in aqueous solution with sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) at 70°C under a nitrogen for 2 hours. Then exposed to oxygen for 45 min, followed by a nitrogen purge. NIPAm, 2-acrylamindo-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS), N,N’-bis(acryoyl)cystamine (BAC), and Acrylic Acid (AAc), in fluorescent batches rhodamine b isothiocyanate (RBITC), were polymerized around the core to form the shell. NPs were purified using tangential flow filtration. The NPs were dialyzed at 4°C for 14 days to remove the core and form hNPs. <jats:italic>Loading &amp; Release:</jats:italic> hNPs and MK2i were incubated at 1 mg/ml at 4°C for 24 h. MK2i released into 1x PBS and analyzed on HPLC. <jats:italic>IL-6 Expression</jats:italic>: Bovine chondrocytes seeded at 10,000 cell/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> were stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-1b daily and treated once with 100 µg/ml MK2i loaded-NP or 100 µg/ml free MK2i treatment on day 2. Analyzed on bovine IL-6 ELISA. <jats:italic>In Vivo Intra Articular Injections:</jats:italic> 75 µl of 2 mg/ml hNPsRHB or a PBS control was injected into the right knee of 4-month old Fischer 344 (Envigo) rats. Rats were imaged daily for 7 days then euthanized, legs dissected, and imaged. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Core removal facilitated increased MK2i release from hNPs, Fig 1A, allowing up to 63% after 5 days in PBS. The hNPs generated here offer a continual sustained release of MK2i and hNPs are non-cytotoxic (data not shown) up to 12 mg/ml. MK2i loaded-NPs significantly knocked down IL-6 production after a single treatment after 2 days, Figure 1B, and continued knockdown for up to 4 days. hNPsRBITC was successfully injected into rat joint space and was retained for at least 7-days compared to pre-injection and PBS control, Fig 1 B-C. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: hNPs protect MK2i from ECM degradation and offer continual sustained release into chondrocytes. Core removal allows for MK2i release <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> with further sustained release compared to previous non-degradable model. The single MK2i treatment lead to a significant IL-6 knockdown bovine chondrocytes for up to 4 days in hNPs. We were able to successfully inject and retain fluorescently labeled hNPs within rat knees for 7 days. Our translational therapeutic shows the promise of delivering a degradable, non-cytotoxic hNP into the joint space to knockdown the inflammatory response to halt the cyclic progression of articular cartilage degradation and progression of PTOA.

    "abstract": "We present optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2013ej, in galaxy M74, from 1 to 450 d after the explosion. SN 2013ej is a hydrogen-rich supernova, classified as a Type IIL due to its relatively fast decline following the initial peak. It has a relatively high peak luminosity (absolute magnitude MV = -17.6) but a small 56Ni production of ~0.023 M⊙. Its photospheric evolution is similar to other Type II SNe, with shallow absorption in the Hα profile typical for a Type IIL. During transition to the radioactive decay tail at ~100 d, we find the SN to grow bluer in B - V colour, in contrast to some other Type II supernovae. At late times, the bolometric light curve declined faster than expected from 56Co decay and we observed unusually broad and asymmetric nebular emission lines. Based on comparison of nebular emission lines most sensitive to the progenitor core mass, we find our observations are best matched to synthesized spectral models with a MZAMS = 12-15 M⊙ progenitor. The derived mass range is similar to but not higher than the mass estimated for Type IIP progenitors. This is against the idea that Type IIL are from more massive stars. Observations are consistent with the SN having a progenitor with a relatively low-mass envelope.",

Our objective was to develop a phamacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model relating ALLO plasma concentrations to electroencephalographic (EEG) effects in dogs. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Four healthy dogs and one dog with epilepsy that had implanted intracranial electrodes were utilized. ALLO doses ranging from 1-6 mg/kg were administered IV over 5 min. EEG data were collected during four IM doses (1-2 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected up to 6 hr following dosing. ALLO concentrations were measured using HPLC-MS/MS. Power density was determined in EEG bands using a custom algorithm. A two-compartment link PKPD model was developed to describe the relation between ALLO plasma concentration and change in EEG power in the alpha, beta, delta and theta bands. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: ALLO caused a rapid increase in absolute power density in all EEG bands measured (1-4, &gt;4 – 8, &gt;8 – 12, &gt;12 – 25, and &gt;25 – 100 Hz). The onset of effect was rapid (1-3 min) and demonstrated by frequency band and dose analysis. Concentration-EEG data were best fit by a two-compartment PK model and sigmoidal Emax PD indirect link model. The beta frequency band was most sensitive, showing increases in power at the lowest ALLO concentrations. The EC50 concentration for the beta frequency was ~270 ng/mL. The EC50 values for effects on the other frequency bands were ~500-700 ng /mL. In conclusion, IV ALLO causes a rapid effect on EEG that can be used to determine minimal plasma concentrations associated with target engagement. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Dose selection for future clinical trials will use the effective concentrations determined here in conjunction with studies in animal status epilepticus models. Studies are planned in client owned dogs with epilepsy to evaluate clinical efficacy in dogs and as nonclinical proof-of-concept evidence supporting translational studies in people.

    "abstract": "Experimentally-induced hyperglycemia by prolonged glucose infusion allows investigation of the effects of sustained stimulation of the pancreatic beta-cell on insulin secretion and sensitivity. Hormonal responses to a meal following prolonged glucose infusions have not been investigated. To determine if a 48-h glucose infusion alters hormonal responses to a test meal as well as food intake and hunger in normal weight individuals, 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women, age 18-30 years, mean BMI=21.7+/-1.6 kg/m2) were infused for 48 h with either saline (50 ml/h) or 15% glucose (200 mg/m2/min). Subjects ingested a 600 kcal mixed nutrient meal 3 h after infusion termination. Blood samples were taken during the 48 h and for 4 h following food ingestion. The 48-h glucose infusion elicited a metabolic profile of a glucose intolerant obese subjects, with increased plasma glucose, insulin and leptin (all P<0.01) and increased HOMA-IR (P<0.001). During meal ingestion, early insulin secretion was increased (P<0.05) but post-prandial glucose (P<0.01) and insulin (P<0.01) excursions were lower following the glucose infusion. Post-prandial plasma triglyceride concentrations were increased after glucose compared with saline. Food intake and hunger ratings were not different between the two conditions. Plasma leptin levels were inversely correlated with hunger (P<0.03) in both conditions and with food intake (P<0.003) during the glucose condition only. Thus, a 48-h glucose infusion does not impair post-prandial hormonal responses, alter food intake or hunger in normal weight subjects. The glucose-induced increases in plasma leptin result in a stronger inverse relationship between plasma leptin and hunger as well as food intake. These data are the first to demonstrate a relationship between leptin and hunger in normal weight, non-calorically restricted human subjects.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) ventilation imaging is a novel promising technique for lung functional imaging. The current standard 4D CT technique using phase-based sorting frequently results in artifacts, which may deteriorate the accuracy of ventilation imaging. The purpose of this study was to quantify the variability of 4D CT ventilation imaging due to 4D CT sorting. METHODS: 4D CT image sets from nine lung cancer patients were each sorted by the phase-based method and anatomic similarity-based method, designed to reduce artifacts, with corresponding ventilation images created for each method. Artifacts in the resulting 4D CT images were quantified with the artifact score which was defined based on the difference between the normalized cross correlation for CT slices within a CT data segment and that for CT slices bordering the interface between adjacent CT data segments. The ventilation variation was quantified using voxel-based Spearman rank correlation coefficients for all lung voxels, and Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) for the spatial overlap of low-functional lung volumes. Furthermore, the correlations with matching single-photon emission CT (SPECT) ventilation images (assumed ground truth) were evaluated for three patients to investigate which sorting method provides higher physiologic accuracy. RESULTS: Anatomic similarity-based sorting reduced 4D CT artifacts compared to phase-based sorting (artifact score, 0.45 ± 0.14 vs 0.58 ± 0.24, p = 0.10 at peak-exhale; 0.63 ± 0.19 vs 0.71 ± 0.31, p = 0.25 at peak-inhale). The voxel-based correlation between the two ventilation images was 0.69 ± 0.26 on average, ranging from 0.03 to 0.85. The DSC was 0.71 ± 0.13 on average. Anatomic similarity-based sorting yielded significantly fewer lung voxels with paradoxical negative ventilation values than phase-based sorting (5.0 ± 2.6% vs 9.7 ± 8.4%, p = 0.05), and improved the correlation with SPECT ventilation regionally. CONCLUSIONS: The variability of 4D CT ventilation imaging due to 4D CT sorting was moderate overall and substantial in some cases, suggesting that 4D CT artifacts are an important source of variations in 4D CT ventilation imaging. Reduction of 4D CT artifacts provided more physiologically convincing and accurate ventilation estimates. Further studies are needed to confirm this result.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) show altered hemodynamics in the ascending aorta that can be assessed by 4D flow MRI. PURPOSE: Comprehensive cardiac MRI was applied to test the hypothesis that BAV-mediated changes in aortic hemodynamics (wall shear stress [WSS] and velocity) are associated with parameters of left ventricular (LV) remodeling. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective data analysis. POPULATION: Forty-nine BAV patients (mean age = 50.2 ± 13.5, 62% male). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP)-CINE, pre- and postcontrast T1 mapping with modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI), time-resolved 3D phase-contrast (PC) MRI with three-directional velocity encoding (4D flow MRI) at 1.5 and 3T. ASSESSMENT: Quantification of LV volumetric data and myocardial mass, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), aortic valve stenosis (AS), and regurgitation (AR). 3D aortic segmentation, quantification of peak systolic velocities, and 3D WSS in the ascending aorta (AAo), arch, and descending aorta (DAo). STATISTICAL TESTS: Two-sided nonpaired t-test to compare subgroups. Pearson correlation coefficient for correlations between aortic hemodynamics and LV parameters. RESULTS: Of the 49 BAV patients, 35 had aortic valve dysfunction (AS [n = 7], AR [n = 16], both AS and AR [n = 12]). Mean systolic WSS in the AAo, peak systolic velocities in the AAo and arch, and LV mass were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the AS/AR group compared to the patients without AS/AR. In the complete group, we observed significant relationships between increased LV mass and elevated peak systolic velocity (r = 0.57, r = 0.58; P < 0.001) and WSS in the AAo and arch, respectively (r = 0.54, r = 0.46; P < 0.001). We detected an association between ECV and WSS in the AAo (r = 0.38, P = 0.02). These relations did not hold true for patients without AV dysfunction. DATA CONCLUSION: AS and AR in BAV patients have a major impact on elevated aortic peak velocities and WSS that were associated with parameters of LV remodeling.

These models are inspired by \"deconstructed\" 5D Scherk-Schwarz orbifold models. However, no fine-tuning of parameters or assumption of higher dimensional Lorentz invariance is necessary, and the number of lattice sites can be as low as just two. These models provide simple ways to solve the doublet-triplet splitting problem, change proton decay predictions, and may provide insight into the structure of the CKM matrix. Since the number of fields in these models is finite, the corrections to the unification of gauge couplings can be reliably calculated, and as expected result only in threshold corrections to the differential running of the couplings. Our analysis also suggests new 4D models which can enjoy the benefits of orbifold models but cannot be obtained by deconstruction of a 5D model.",

    "abstract": "Climate change adaptation, mitigation and food security may be addressed at the same time by enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration through environmentally sound land management practices. This is promoted by the \"4 per 1000\" Initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform aiming at increasing SOC storage through sustainable practices. The scientific and technical committee of the Initiative is working to identify indicators, research priorities and region-specific practices needed for their implementation. The Initiative received its name due to the global importance of soils for climate change, which can be illustrated by a thought experiment showing that an annual growth rate of only 0.4% of the standing global SOC stocks would have the potential to counterbalance the current increase in atmospheric CO2. However, there are numerous barriers to the rise in SOC stocks and while SOC sequestration can contribute to partly offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, its main benefits are related to increased soil quality and climate change adaptation. The Initiative provides a collaborative platform for policy makers, practitioners, scientists and stakeholders to engage in finding solutions. Criticism of the Initiative has been related to the poor definition of its numerical target, which was not understood as an aspirational goal. The objective of this paper is to present the aims of the initiative, to discuss critical issues and to present challenges for its implementation. We identify barriers, risks and trade-offs and advocate for collaboration between multiple parties in order to stimulate innovation and to initiate the transition of agricultural systems toward sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Progesterone (P) and prolactin (PRL) fulfill crucial roles during growth and differentiation of the mammary epithelium, and each has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mammary cancer. We previously identified that these hormones synergistically stimulate the proliferation of mouse mammary epithelial cells in vivo, although the mechanism(s) underlying their cooperative effect are unknown. We now report a novel pathway by which P and PRL synergize to activate transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the mouse mammary tumor virus-LTR (MMTV-LTR) in T47D breast cancer cells. Using serial 5' and 3' deletions of the MMTV-LTR, in addition to selective mutations, we identified that a previously uncharacterized inverted palindrome on the distal enhancer (-941/-930), in addition to a signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 site, was essential for the synergistic activation of transcription by P and PRL. Notably, hormone synergy occurred via a mechanism that was independent of the P receptor DNA-binding elements found in the proximal MMTV-LTR hormone-response element. The palindrome specifically recruited a protein complex (herein termed mammary gland-specific complex) that was almost exclusive to normal and cancerous mammary cells. The synergy between P and PRL occurred via a Janus kinase 2 and c-Src/Fyn-dependent signaling cascade downstream of P and PRL receptors. Combined, our data outline a novel pathway in T47D cells that may facilitate the action(s) of P and PRL during mammary development and breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila grows within membrane-bound vacuoles in alveolar macrophages during human disease. Pathogen manipulation of the host cell is driven by bacterial proteins translocated through a type IV secretion system (T4SS). Although host protein synthesis during infection is arrested by the action of several of these translocated effectors, translation of a subset of host proteins predicted to restrict the pathogen is maintained. To identify the spectrum of host proteins selectively synthesized after L. pneumophila challenge, macrophages infected with the pathogen were allowed to incorporate the amino acid analog azidohomoalanine (AHA) during a 2-h time window, and newly synthesized macrophage proteins were isolated by orthogonal chemistry followed by mass spectrometry. Among the proteins isolated were interferon-stimulated genes as well as proteins translated from highly abundant transcripts. Surprisingly, a large number of the identified proteins were from low-abundance transcripts. These proteins were predicted to be among the most efficiently translated per unit transcript in the cell based on ribosome profiling data sets. To determine if high ribosome loading was a consequence of efficient translation initiation, the 5' untranslated regions (5' UTR) of transcripts having the highest and lowest predicted loading levels were inserted upstream of a reporter, and translation efficiency was determined in response to L. pneumophila challenge. The efficiency of reporter expression largely correlated with predicted ribosome loading and lack of secondary structure. Therefore, determinants in the 5' UTR allow selected host cell transcripts to overcome a pathogen-driven translation blockade.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of mental impairment, is generally caused by large expansions of a CGG repeat in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene followed by transcriptional silencing. However, there is growing evidence that translation of the FMR1 message is also impaired, presumably because of the expanded CGG element in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the FMR1 message. To study the properties of the FMR1 5'-UTR, deletions were generated within a normal 5'-UTR with 16 CGG repeats for both monocistronic and dicistronic (luciferase) reporter constructs. Transient transfection experiments revealed a approximately 20-nucleotide region upstream of the CGG repeat element that functions as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The normal CGG element itself does not appear to influence the efficiency of IRES-mediated stimulation of downstream reporter activity (approximately 18-fold over controls). Additional controls indicate that the enhanced activity of the downstream reporter is not due to readthrough from the upstream cistron, nor is it due to translation of cryptic monocistronic transcripts. The role of the FMR1 IRES element is not known at present; however, by analogy to other IRES-containing mRNAs expressed in neurons, the FMR1 IRES element may help to promote translation in dendrites.",

This perspective introduces the chemocatalytic approach to biorefining as the driving force behind the development of multifunctional chemical platforms. The main advantage of CMF over HMF is that it can be produced in high yield under mild conditions directly from raw biomass. Its stability and hydrophobicity markedly facilitate isolation. CMF is also a precursor to levulinic acid (LA), another versatile biobased intermediate. The logistics of CMF production are discussed, including reactor materials, HCl handling and management, byproducts, and the fate of collateral biomass components (hemicellulose, lipids, proteins, lignin). Examples of commercial markets that can be unlocked by synthetic manipulation of CMF are broken out into two derivative manifolds, furanic and levulinic, which are distributed over three product family trees: renewable monomers, fuels, and specialty chemicals. Selected examples of CMF- and LA-based routes to these products are presented. Finally, a model for the integration of the CMF process into biorefinery practice is put forward.",

Patient assessments were also captured using the same instrument as well as scar width and complications. The mean sum of the six components of the POSAS was 10.26 vs 12.74 for PP and FG, respectively, significantly (p < 0.001) in favor of PP.

The aim of this study was to determine whether AICAR stimulates muscle glucose uptake in humans. We studied 29 healthy men (aged 26 +/- 8 years, BMI 25 +/- 4 kg/m(2) [mean +/- SD]). Rates of muscle 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake were determined by measuring accumulation of total muscle 2DG (2DG and 2DG-6-phosphate) during a primed, continuous 2DG infusion. The effects of AICAR and exercise on muscle AMPK activity/phosphorylation and 2DG uptake were determined. Whole-body glucose disposal was compared before and during AICAR with the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Muscle 2DG uptake was linear over 9 h (R(2) = 0.88 +/- 0.09). After 3 h, 2DG uptake increased 2.1 +/- 0.8- and 4.7 +/- 1.7-fold in response to AICAR or bicycle exercise, respectively. AMPK alpha(1) and alpha(2) activity or AMPK phosphorylation was unchanged after 20 min or 3 h of AICAR, but AMPK phosphorylation significantly increased immediately and 3 h after bicycle exercise. AICAR significantly increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, but phosphorylation of beta-acetyl-CoA carboxylase, glycogen synthase, and protein kinase B or insulin receptor substrate-1 level was unchanged. Mean whole-body glucose disposal increased by 7% with AICAR from 9.3 +/- 0.6 to 10 +/- 0.6 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (P < 0.05).

Here, we show that 5-ASA ameliorates colitis in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice by activating PPAR-γ signaling in the intestinal epithelium. DSS-induced colitis was associated with a loss of epithelial hypoxia and a respiration-dependent luminal expansion of Escherichia coli, which could be ameliorated by treatment with 5-ASA. However, 5-ASA was no longer able to reduce inflammation, restore epithelial hypoxia, or blunt an expansion of E. coli in DSS-treated mice that lacked Pparg expression specifically in the intestinal epithelium. These data suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of 5-ASA requires activation of epithelial PPAR-γ signaling, thus pointing to the intestinal epithelium as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in ulcerative colitis.IMPORTANCE An expansion of Enterobacterales in the fecal microbiota is a microbial signature of dysbiosis that is linked to many noncommunicable diseases, including ulcerative colitis. Here, we used Escherichia coli, a representative of the Enterobacterales, to show that its dysbiotic expansion during colitis can be remediated by modulating host epithelial metabolism. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis reduced mitochondrial activity in the colonic epithelium, thereby increasing the amount of oxygen available to fuel an E. coli expansion through aerobic respiration. Activation of epithelial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) signaling with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) was sufficient to restore mitochondrial activity and blunt a dysbiotic E. coli expansion. These data identify the host's epithelial metabolism as a potential treatment target to remediate microbial signatures of dysbiosis, such as a dysbiotic E. coli expansion in the fecal microbiota.",

Commensal bacteria can reestablish microbiota-mediated colonization resistance after completion of antibiotic therapy, but they cannot engraft during antibiotic prophylaxis. Here we use a mouse model to provide a proof of concept for an alternative approach, which replaces commensal bacteria functionally with drugs to restore colonization resistance against C. albicans . Streptomycin treatment, which depletes Clostridia from the gut microbiota, disrupted colonization resistance against C. albicans and increased epithelial oxygenation in the large intestine. Inoculating mice with a defined community of commensal Clostridia species reestablished colonization resistance and restored epithelial hypoxia. Notably, these functions of commensal Clostridia species could be replaced functionally with the drug 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), which activates mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the epithelium of the large intestine. When streptomycin-treated mice received 5-ASA, the drug reestablished colonization resistance against C. albicans and restored physiological hypoxia in the epithelium of the large intestine. We conclude that 5-ASA treatment is a non-biotic intervention that restores colonization resistance against C. albicans without requiring the administration of live bacteria.",

The expression of 5-HT 4 receptor mRNA in duodenal mucosa and epithelial cells was analyzed by RT-PCR. cAMP-dependent signaling pathway inhibitors MDL-12330A, Rp-cAMP, and H-89 and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway inhibitors verapamil and W-13 markedly reduced 5-HT-stimulated duodenal bicarbonate secretion and short-circuit current (Isc, whereas cGMP-dependent signaling pathway inhibitors NS-2028 and KT-5823 failed to alter these responses. Both SB-204070 and high-dose ICS-205930 (selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists) markedly inhibited 5-HT-stimulated bicarbonate secretion and Isc, whereas methiothepine (5-HT1 receptor antagonist), ketanserin (5-HT2 receptor antagonist), and a low concentration of ICS-205930 (5-HT3 receptor antagonist) had no effect. RS-67506 (partial 5-HT4 receptor agonist) concentration-dependently increased bicarbonate secretion and Isc whereas 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-HT1 receptor agonist), a-methyl-5-HT (5-HT2 receptor agonist), and phenylbiguanide (5-HT3 receptor agonist) did not significantly increase bicarbonate secretion or Isc. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of 5-HT4 receptor mRNA in murine duodenal mucosa and epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that 5-HT regulates DMBS via both cAMP- and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways and 5-HT 4 receptors located in the duodenal mucosa and/or epithelial cells.",

The interaction of the 5-HT and FMRFa pathways was recently investigated in Aplysia at the level of gene expression. However, little is known about crosstalk of these pathways at the level of the second messenger cascades. We investigated the potential interaction of the 5-HT and FMRFa pathways at the level of the Erk cascade. We found that FMRFa inhibited basal Erk activity through p38 MAPK. FMRFa also inhibited 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of Erk and nuclear accumulation of phospho-ERK, suggesting that FMRFa may place inhibitory constraints on memory formation through regulation of the Erk MAPK cascade.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelic compounds have displayed antidepressant potential in both humans and rodents. Despite their promise, psychedelics can induce undesired effects that pose safety concerns and limit their clinical scalability. The rational development of optimized psychedelic-related medicines will require a full mechanistic understanding of how these molecules produce therapeutic effects. While the hallucinogenic properties of psychedelics are generally attributed to activation of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs), it is currently unclear if these receptors also mediate their antidepressant effects as several nonhallucinogenic analogues of psychedelics with antidepressant-like properties have been developed. Moreover, many psychedelics exhibit promiscuous pharmacology, making it challenging to identify their primary therapeutic target(s). Here, we use a combination of pharmacological and genetic tools to demonstrate that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is essential for tryptamine-based psychedelics to produce antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Our results suggest that psychedelic tryptamines can induce hallucinogenic and therapeutic effects through activation of the same receptor.",

    "abstract": "The neurotransmitter serotonin plays a pivotal role in mood and depression. It also acts as a vasoconstrictor within blood vessels and is the main neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal system. In neurotransmission, released serotonin is taken up by serotonin transporters, which are principal targets of antidepressants and the psychostimulant, ecstasy. The investigation of serotonin transporters have relied almost exclusively on the use of radiolabeled serotonin in heterogenous end-point assays. Here we adapt the genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, iSeroSnFR, to establish and validate the Serotonin (5-HT) Fluorescence Assay for Transport and Release (5-HT_FAsTR) for functional and pharmacological studies of serotonin transport and release. We demonstrate the applicability of the method for the study of a neuronal, high-affinity, low-capacity serotonin transporter (SERT) as well as an extraneuronal low-affinity, high-capacity organic cation transporter and mutants thereof. 5HT_FAsTR offers an accessible, versatile and reliable semi-homogenous assay format that only relies on a fluorescence plate reader for repeated, real-time measurements of serotonin influx and efflux. 5HT_FAsTR accelerates and democratizes functional characterization and pharmacological studies of serotonin transporters and genetic variants thereof in disease states such as depression, anxiety and ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Although duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion (DMBS) is currently accepted as an important defense mechanism against acid-induced duodenal injury, the mechanism and the regulation of DMBS are largely unknown. 5-HT may regulate DMBS, but little is known about its physiological relevance in DMBS and the underlying mechanism(s). Thus, the aims of the present study were to demonstrate the role of 5-HT in acid-stimulated DMBS and to further elucidate the precise mechanisms involved in this process. Luminal acid stimulation significantly increased 5-HT release from the duodenal mucosa (P<0.01). SB204070, a selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, dose-dependently reduced luminal acid-stimulated HCO3(-) secretion of mice in vivo. In Ussing chamber studies, 5-HT-induced I(SC) and DMBS were abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+, and significantly attenuated by pharmacological blockade of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), intermediate Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IK(Ca)), or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). 5-HT increased cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) in SCBN cells, a duodenal epithelial cell line, and knockdown of NCX1 proteins with a specific siRNA greatly decreased this 5-HT-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that 5-HT plays a physiological role in acid-stimulated DMBS via a Ca2+ signaling pathway, in which the plasma membrane NCX transporter as well as IK(Ca) and CFTR channels may be involved.",

    "abstract": "DNA 5-methylcytosine (5-meC) is an important epigenetic mark for transcriptional gene silencing in many eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, 5-meC DNA glycosylase/lyases actively remove 5-meC to counteract transcriptional gene silencing in a locus-specific manner, and have been suggested to maintain the expression of transposons. However, it is unclear whether plant DNA demethylases can promote the transposition of transposons. Here we report the functional characterization of the DNA glycosylase/lyase DNG701 in rice. DNG701 encodes a large (1,812 amino acid residues) DNA glycosylase domain protein. Recombinant DNG701 protein showed 5-meC DNA glycosylase and lyase activities in vitro. Knockout or knockdown of DNG701 in rice plants led to DNA hypermethylation and reduced expression of the retrotransposon Tos17. Tos17 showed less transposition in calli derived from dng701 knockout mutant seeds compared with that in wild-type calli. Overexpression of DNG701 in both rice calli and transgenic plants substantially reduced DNA methylation levels of Tos17 and enhanced its expression. The overexpression also led to more frequent transposition of Tos17 in calli. Our results demonstrate that rice DNG701 is a 5-meC DNA glycosylase/lyase responsible for the demethylation of Tos17 and this DNA demethylase plays a critical role in promoting Tos17 transposition in rice calli.",

    "abstract": "The inhibition of the mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a promising new therapy in the treatment of hypertention and inflammation. The problems of limited water solubility and high melting points commonly displayed by the active 1,3-disubstituted ureas prevent the further development of potent urea-based sEH inhibitors. Therefore, a new class of potent inhibitors of sEH were designed and synthesized by the introduction of a polar constrained piperazino group in the right side of adasmantyl urea to increase the water solubility. A facile and general synthesis was established to prepare a series of 1-adamantan-1-yl-3-(2-piperazin-2-yl-ethyl)-ureas (1a-d) with various 5-substitutions on the 2-piperazino ring, which will advance the SAR study by the efficient making of structurally diverse analogs. The effect of the 5-substitution on the activity and the water solubility was examined. The best potency was exhibited by the 5-benzyl-substituted-piperazine-containing urea with an IC50 value of 1.37 microM against human sEH and good water solubility (S=7.46 mg/mL) and low melting point, in which the 5-substituted piperazine serves as a favorable secondary pharmacophore and a water-solubility enhancing group. Our present work provides a promising new template for the design of orally available therapeutic agents for the disorders that can be addressed by changing the in vivo concentration of the chemical mediators that contain an epoxide.",

We present herein a citational network analysis of these papers, and touch on some of the important discoveries in plant biology that have been made in this powerful model system, and highlight how these discoveries have then had an impact in crop species. We also look to the future, highlighting some outstanding questions that can be readily addressed in Arabidopsis. Topics that are discussed include Arabidopsis reverse genetic resources, stock centers, databases and online tools, cell biology, development, hormones, plant immunity, signaling in response to abiotic stress, transporters, biosynthesis of cells walls and macromolecules such as starch and lipids, epigenetics and epigenomics, genome-wide association studies and natural variation, gene regulatory networks, modeling and systems biology, and synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myocardial mass is a key determinant of cardiac muscle function and hypertrophy. Myocardial depolarization leading to cardiac muscle contraction is reflected by the amplitude and duration of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Abnormal QRS amplitude or duration reflect changes in myocardial mass and conduction, and are associated with increased risk of heart failure and death. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis sought to gain insights into the genetic determinants of myocardial mass. METHODS: We carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 4 QRS traits in up to 73,518 individuals of European ancestry, followed by extensive biological and functional assessment. RESULTS: We identified 52 genomic loci, of which 32 are novel, that are reliably associated with 1 or more QRS phenotypes at p < 1 × 10(-8). These loci are enriched in regions of open chromatin, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding, suggesting that they represent regions of the genome that are actively transcribed in the human heart. Pathway analyses provided evidence that these loci play a role in cardiac hypertrophy. We further highlighted 67 candidate genes at the identified loci that are preferentially expressed in cardiac tissue and associated with cardiac abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. We validated the regulatory function of a novel variant in the SCN5A/SCN10A locus in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings provide new insights into genes and biological pathways controlling myocardial mass and may help identify novel therapeutic targets.",

There were no frail patients in the under 20-year-old group. In the 21–30 there were 3 patients (0.7%) that had an MFI of 2 or more placing them in the frail group. Frailty was significantly different across the age groups (p&amp;lt; 0.001). As patients age, the proportion of female patients increases (from 17.6% to 37.5%. p&amp;lt; 0.0001). Frailty was also associated with gender with women having a higher percentage of frailty (p=0.0006). With respect to burn size, age category was not associated with burn size (p=0.12), but frail patients had smaller burns than non-frail or pre-frail patients (9.5% vs. 13.3% vs. 12.2%, p=0.0002).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Pre-frail patients were identified in all age groups.

    "abstract": "Radiometric dating of secondary minerals can be used to constrain the timing of aqueous alteration on meteoritic parent bodies. Dolomite is a well-documented secondary mineral in CM chondrites, and is thought to have formed by precipitation from an aqueous fluid on the CM parent body within several million years of accretion. The petrographic context of crosscutting dolomite veins indicates that aqueous alteration occurred in situ, rather than in the nebular setting. Here, we present 53Mn-53Cr systematics for dolomite grains in Sutter's Mill section SM51-1. The Mn-Cr isotope data show well-resolved excesses of 53Cr correlated with 55Mn/52Cr ratio, which we interpret as evidence for the in situ decay of radioactive 53Mn. After correcting for the relative sensitivities of Mn and Cr using a synthetic Mn- and Cr-bearing calcite standard, the data yield an isochron with slope corresponding to an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio of 3.42 ± 0.86 × 10-6. The reported error includes systematic uncertainty from the relative sensitivity factor. When calculated relative to the U-corrected Pb-Pb absolute age of the D'Orbigny angrite, Sutter's Mill dolomites give a formation age between 4564.8 and 4562.2 Ma (2.4-5.0 Myr after the birth of the solar system). This age is contemporaneous with previously reported ages for secondary carbonates in CM and CI chondrites. Consistent carbonate precipitation ages between the carbonaceous chondrite groups suggest that aqueous alteration was a common process during the early stages of parent body formation, probably occurring via heating from internal 26Al decay. The high-precision isochron for Sutter's Mill dolomite indicates that late-stage processing did not reach temperatures that were high enough to further disturb the Mn-Cr isochron.",

Through simultaneously constrained simulations of the CW-EPR and ESE-ENDOR data, we conclude that four effective 55Mn hyperfine tensors (A(X), A(Y), A(Z)) are required to properly simulate the experimental data [untreated and MeOH-treated PS II centers (MHz): -232, -232, -270; 200, 200, 250; -311, -311, -270; 180, 180, 240; ammonia-treated PS II centers (MHz): 208, 208, 158; -150, -150, -112; 222, 222, 172; -295, -315, -390]. We further show that these effective hyperfine tensors are best supported by a trimer/monomer arrangement of three Mn(IV) ions and one Mn(III) ion. In this topology, Mn(A), Mn(B), and Mn(C) form a strongly exchange coupled core (J(AB) and J(BC) < -100 cm-1) while Mn(D) is weakly exchange coupled (J(CD)) to one end of the trinuclear core. For untreated and MeOH-treated PS II centers, the Mn(III) ion is either Mn(A) or Mn(C), with a zero-field-splitting of D = -1.25 to -2.25 cm-1. For ammonia-treated PS II centers, the Mn(III) ion is Mn(D), with a zero-field-splitting of D = +0.75 to +1.75 cm-1. The binding of the ammonia ligand results in a shift of the Mn(III) ion from the trinuclear core to the monomer Mn ion. This structural model can also account for the higher spin of the g = 4.1 signal and the magnetic properties of the S0-state.",

A questionnaire was used to gather information about the participants’ exposure to environmental factors. Saliva samples werecollected from 349 participants. Newborn dried blood spotsfrom probands and parents are still being collected from the California New born Registry. DNA was extracted from 349 saliva samples from 85 families and subjected to whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to analyze DNA methylation. Sequence alignments and bioinformatic analyses will be performed using R packages called DMRichR and Comethyl. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Sequence alignments and bioinformatic analyses are ongoing, utilizing DMRichR to identify individual genomic loci associated with ASD in each of the three generations and Comethyl to compare correlation patterns between methylation marks and selected variables, including grand parental exposures. New born blood spot collections of parents and probands are ongoing and will be used to identify potential ASD epigenomic signatures that are tissue and life-stage independent. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This research will provide new insights into the increased prevalence and underlying etiology of ASD that should pave the way for future research in the field. DNA Methylation signatures can help create molecular biomarkers which can be used together with behavioral clinical tests for diagnosis of ASD.</jats:p>",

We recommend optimizing opioid prescribing practices to reduce over-prescribing opioids to burn injured children and educating families on the need for proper disposal of left-over opioids.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Optical transport network has been demonstrated to play an important role for carrying 5G radio signals. This paper focuses on the future challenges, recent studies and potential solutions for the 5G flexible optical transport networks with the performances on large-capacity, low-latency and high-efficiency. In addition, we discuss the technology development trends of the 5G transport networks in terms of the optical device, optical transport system, optical switching, and optical networking. Finally, we conclude the paper with the improvement of network intelligence enabled by these technologies to deterministic content delivery over 5G optical transport networks.",

    "abstract": "Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) is a successful industry cooperation defining the publicly available specification for the key internal interface of radio base stations between the radio equipment control (REC) and the radio equipment (RE) in the fronthaul of mobile networks. However, CPRI is expensive to deploy, consumes large bandwidth, and currently is statically configured. On the other hand, an Ethernet-based mobile fronthaul will be cost-efficient and more easily reconfigurable. Encapsulating CPRI over Ethernet (CoE) is an attractive solution, but stringent CPRI requirements such as delay and jitter are major challenges that need to be met to make CoE a reality. This study investigates whether CoE can meet delay and jitter requirements by performing FPGA-based Verilog experiments and simulations. Verilog experiments show that CoE encapsulation with fixed Ethernet frame size requires about tens of microseconds. Numerical experiments show that the proposed scheduling policy of CoE flows on Ethernet can reduce jitter when redundant Ethernet capacity is provided. The reduction in jitter can be as large as 1 μs, hence making Ethernet-based mobile fronthaul a credible technology.",

    "abstract": "In vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that the bioactive, 5α-reduced progesterone metabolite, 5α-dihydroprogesterone (DHP) is synthesized in the placenta, supporting equine pregnancy, but its appearance in early pregnancy argues for other sites of synthesis also. It remains unknown if DHP circulates at relevant concentrations in cyclic mares and, if so, does synthesis involve the non-pregnant uterus? Jugular blood was drawn daily from cyclic mares (n = 5). Additionally, ovariectomized mares (OVX) and geldings were administered progesterone (300 mg) intramuscularly. Blood was drawn before and after treatment. Incubations of whole equine blood and hepatic microsomes with progesterone were also investigated for evidence of DHP synthesis. Sample analysis for progesterone, DHP and other steroids employed validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. Progesterone and DHP appeared a day (d) after ovulation in cyclic mares, was increased significantly by d3, peaking from d5 to 10 and decreased from d13 to 17. DHP was 55.5 ± 3.2% of progesterone concentrations throughout the cycle and was highly correlated with it. DHP was detected immediately after progesterone administration to OVX mares and geldings, maintaining a relatively constant ratio with progesterone (47.2 ± 2.9 and 51.2 ± 2.7%, respectively). DHP was barely detectable in whole blood and hepatic microsome incubations. We conclude that DHP is a physiologically relevant progestogen in cyclic, non-pregnant mares, likely stimulating the uterus, and that it is synthesized peripherally from luteal progesterone but not in the liver or blood. The presence of DHP in pregnant perissodactyla as well as proboscidean species suggests horses may be a valuable model for reproductive endocrinology in other exotic taxa.",

    "abstract": "Cbl and folate are both necessary for the metabolism of HCYS, whereas only Cbl is required for MMA metabolism. During the past decade, analytical methods have been developed that are sensitive enough to detect low levels of MMA and HCYS normally present in the plasma. These methods are sufficiently precise to be used in the clinical laboratory and measurements of the serum levels of the metabolites provide sensitive and specific techniques for the identification of Cbl and folate deficiencies. These techniques constitute an important addition to the battery of diagnostic tests that are available for detecting the vitamin deficiencies and for distinguishing each from the other. By virtue of the role of Cbl and folate in the metabolic pathways that involve MMA and HCYS, levels of both metabolites rise in Cbl deficiency, but only HCYS rises in folate deficiency. During the development of Cbl or folate deficiencies, accumulation of these metabolites in the plasma signals the existence of a condition of biochemical vitamin deficiency of sufficient degree to cause impairment in the metabolic pathways which are dependent on these vitamins. Circulating metabolite levels appear to accurately reflect the nutritional status of the vitamins and a rise in serum metabolite levels is therefore one of the earliest and most reliable indicators of developing Cbl and folate deficiencies. Elevations of serum metabolites above the reference range not only precede a fall in the serum vitamin levels but also show a more consistent correlation with objective evidence of vitamin deficiency than do low blood vitamin levels. The advent of serum metabolite measurements has also made it possible to identify subtle or atypical forms of vitamin deficiency that may be associated with unusual or previously undiscovered disease manifestations. Thus, in patients who display only neurological manifestations of disease, underlying Cbl deficiency may be revealed by the finding of raised serum or urine levels of MMA. Similarly, unsuspected folate deficiency may be disclosed by the finding of a raised serum HCYS. This may have important implications with respect to disease risk, since there is mounting evidence that sub-optimal folate nutritional status may be associated with increased risks of vascular disease, neoplasia and birth defects. Finally, the measurement of serum levels of MMA, HCYS and other metabolites that accumulate in Cbl and folate deficiencies may provide important new insights into the mechanism whereby these vitamin deficiencies lead to different patterns and manifestations of disease.",

Included in the series of bromonucleosides studied is the guanosine derivative N(2)-2',3',5'-tetraacetyl-6-bromopurine ribonucleoside, the synthesis of which is reported here for the first time. Brominated nucleosides had not previously been considered optimal substrates for S(N)Ar reactions given the general reactivity trend for halogenated aromatic systems (i.e. F > Cl > Br > I). However, even weakly nucleophilic aromatic amines give high yields of the substitution products in polar solvents with these 6-bromopurine nucleosides. For primary aromatic amines, secondary aliphatic amines, and imidazole, reaction takes place only at C6, with no effect on the acetyl-protected ribose. In addition, we report the first synthesis of 3',5'-di-O-acetyl-6-bromopurine-2'-deoxyribonucleoside and its reaction with an arylamine in MeOH in the absence of added metal catalyst. Thus, C6-arylamine derivatives of both adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine can be prepared via simple S(N)Ar reactions with the corresponding 6-bromo precursor. We also describe high yielding and C6-selective substitution reactions with 6-bromonucleosides using alcohol and thiol nucleophiles in the presence of added base (DBU). Finally, C6-bromonucleosides are shown to be readily hydrogenated to give purine or 2-aminopurine products in good yield. This work increases the arsenal of reactions and strategies available for the synthesis of nucleoside analogues as potential biochemical tools or new therapeutics.",

Sixty HF patients with an ejection fraction ≤ 40% evaluated in 2004 and 2005 were reevaluated in 2008. Six-minute walk distance (6MW), frailty score, and biomarkers (25-hydroxyvitamin D, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured. Participants were categorized at baseline and follow-up into 3 groups: nonfrail/normal endurance (NF/NE), nonfrail/low endurance (NF/LE) and frail/low endurance (F/LE). Survival time was assessed according to frailty/endurance status and associated predictors of mortality. Forty-three men, 17 women (mean age, 78 ± 12 years) were contacted. At follow-up, 20 had died, 20 participated, and 20 did not participate. There were no changes in frailty/endurance status over time (McNemar;P=.19). Deaths occurred in 18% of NF/NE, 45% of NF/LE, and 60% of F/LE persons. The NF/NE group had greater survival rates than the NF/LE (  P=.032) and F/LE (  P=.014) groups. The 6MW and frailty score were independently predictive of mortality, with hazard ratios of 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.94) and 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.26), respectively, as was New York Heart Association class and IL-6. Backward stepwise Cox regression revealed that 6MW and frailty each were associated with mortality (P=.005) and highly correlated. Physical function is an important predictor of mortality in older adults with HF. The 6MW may be useful as a measure of frailty.",

Pretreatment data provide insight into reliability, concurrent validity, and minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and other endpoints. METHODS: Screening and baseline evaluations included the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), timed function tests (TFTs), quantitative strength by myometry, the PedsQL, heart rate-determined energy expenditure index, and other exploratory endpoints. RESULTS: The 6MWT proved feasible and reliable in a multicenter context. Concurrent validity with other endpoints was excellent. The MCID for 6MWD was 28.5 and 31.7 meters based on 2 statistical distribution methods. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of MCID to baseline mean is lower for 6MWD than for other endpoints. The 6MWD is an optimal primary endpoint for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) clinical trials that are focused therapeutically on preservation of ambulation and slowing of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Data is currently lacking anchoring a 30-meter longitudinal change in walking ability by 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy as a minimal clinically important difference and \"clinically meaningful\" person-reported outcomes (PROs) at differing levels of ambulatory ability. METHODS: We describe correlation between measures, 1-year change in measures, and correlation of 1-year changes between measures for the six-minute walk test (6MWT), 10-meter run/walk velocity, PedsQL and POSNA Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) in 24 4-12 year old. ambulatory DMD and 36 typical controls, and determine if minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of PROs contribute to different estimates of 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) change at differing levels of ability. RESULTS: PedsQL total and physical function and PODCI global, transfer/mobility and sports/physical function PROs demonstrated significant differences between DMD and controls (p<0.00001). In DMD, 6MWD and 10-meter run/walk velocity were correlated with PODCI domain scores, with the transfer/mobility scale showing the strongest relationship (r=0.79 and r=0.76). In DMD, 6MWD distance and 10-meter run/walk velocity weakly correlated with PedsQL domain scores. In DMD, 6MWD, 10-meter run/walk velocity, and PODCI global and transfer and basic mobility demonstrated significant one-year change and exceeded the amount of change representing MCID. In DMD, 6MWD change highly correlated with change in PODCI global and PODCI transfer/mobility scores (r=0.76 and r=0.93). PODCI global and PODCI transfer/mobility scales provided the best estimates of 6MWT performance. A \"meaningful\" 4.5 point change in a low PODCI transfer / basic mobility score of 30 to 34.5 was associated with a 5.6m 6MWD change from 150.3 to 155.9m. At PODCI levels closer to normative levels for healthy controls, the change in 6MWD distance associated with a \"meaningful\" change in PODCI scores was almost 46m. DISCUSSION: At lower levels of function, smaller increases in 6MWD result in meaningful change in quality of life (QoL) instrument scores. At higher levels of function, larger increases may be necessary to achieve the same QoL change score.",

    "abstract": "Walking abnormalities are prominent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We modified the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) for use as an outcome measure in patients with DMD and evaluated its performance in 21 ambulatory boys with DMD and 34 healthy boys, ages 4 to 12 years. Boys with DMD were tested twice, approximately 1 week apart; controls were tested once. The groups had similar age, height, and weight. All tests were completed. Boys who fell recovered rapidly from falls without injury. Mean +/- SD [range] 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) was lower in boys with DMD than in controls (366 +/- 83 [125-481] m vs. 621 +/- 68 [479-754] m; P < 0.0001; unpaired t-test). Test-retest correlation for boys with DMD was high (r = 0.91). Stride length (R(2) = 0.89; P < 0.0001) was the major determinant of 6MWD for both boys with DMD and controls. A modified 6MWT is feasible and safe, documents disease-related limitations on ambulation, is reproducible, and offers a new outcome measure for DMD natural history and therapeutic trials.",

The 6MWD was assessed in 18 boys with DBMD and 22 healthy boys, ages 4-12 years, over mean [range] intervals of 58 [39-87] and 69 [52-113] weeks, respectively. Height and weight increased similarly in both groups. At 52 weeks, 6MWD decreased in 12 of 18 (67%) DBMD subjects (overall mean [range]: 357 [125-481] to 300 [0-510] meters; Δ -57 meters, -15.9%), but increased in 14 of 22 (64%) healthy subjects (overall mean [range]: 623 [479-754] to 636 [547-717] meters; Δ +13 meters, +2.1%). Two DBMD subjects lost ambulation. Changes in 6MWD depended on stride length and age; improvements usually occurred by 7-8 years of age; older DBMD subjects worsened, whereas older healthy subjects were stable. The 6MWD changes at 1 year confirm the validity of this endpoint and emphasize that preserving ambulation must remain a major goal of DBMD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Long records of paleoearthquakes are essential for understanding earthquake recurrence behavior of active faults and for evaluating regional seismic hazard. However, paleoseismic data on the Altyn Tagh fault (ATF), one of the longest strike-slip fault in Asia, are scarce. We document a long paleoseismic record along the Xorkoli section of the central ATF. Eight and probably nine earthquakes are identified based on event evidence in the form of open fissures, folds, unconformities, and upward fault terminations, with modeled mean (95% confidence) ages of A.D. 1598 (1491–1741) yr (event A), A.D. 797 (676–926) yr (B), B.C. 668 (732–589) yr (C), B.C. 956 (1206–715) yr (D), B.C. 1301 (1369–1235) yr (E), B.C. 2105 (2233–1987) yr (F, probable), B.C. 2663 (2731–2601) yr (G), B.C. 2818 (2878–2742) yr (H), B.C. 3396 (3522–3205) yr (I). The mean recurrence interval is 620 ± 410 yr with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 0.67, indicating that earthquake recurrence is weakly periodic, with individual intervals ranging from as short as 150 yr to as long as 1460 yr. A global compilation of 35 strike-slip paleoseismic sites yields a similar average COV of 0.69. Synthesis of paleoseismic sites from the central ATF indicates that not all earthquakes ruptured to the eastern end of the Xorkoli section, within the Aksay restraining bend. Given that the 420-yr elapsed time since the most recent event, well within a COV of mean interval, a large surface-rupturing earthquake could occur at any time along the central ATF.",

In order to assess our outcomes in treating these children we have integrated the use of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a standardized, valid and reliable PRO tool funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) into our clinical practice in order to evaluate aspects of the patient’s health-related quality of life. The PROMIS pediatric assessment was developed to capture self-reported anger, depression, peer relationships, pain, and physical function. This study specifically assessed the PROMIS Pediatric Peer Relationship summary scores in burn survivors to assess quality of life. The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between such quality-of-life outcomes and burn injury related factors.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Following IRB approval, we performed a retrospective review of children with burn injuries who had completed the PROMIS at our institution between 2017 and 2019. Data collected includes patient demographics, burn injury information, PROMIS peer relationship T-scores and time since injury. Statistical analysis was conducted using chi-square, t-test ANOVA, or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The PROMIS Peer Relationships Pediatric Item Banks assess self-reported quality of relationships with friends and other acquaintances. A standardized score, or T-score, of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10. A peer relationships T-score of 60 is one standard deviation (SD) above the average while a T-score of 40 is one SD below the average.

The most common obstacles stated were: transportation (143, 41.8%), cost (100, 29.2%), and time off work/school (70, 20.5%). The planned mode of transportation to appointments was being driven by someone else in a personal car (234, 68.4%), the second most common response was that they were unsure of their transportation (29, 8.5%). Patients traveled a great distance to come to the clinic with 188 patients (55%) traveling more than one hour. The most frequent discharge location was the patient’s home (169, 49.4%), with the second most frequent being the home of a friend or family member (95, 27.8%). Sixty-two patients (18.1%) were homeless at the time of admission. When asked about their motivation for following up in clinic the most common response was concern about their injuries/healing (269, 78.7%). The most common levels of educational attainment were high school (149, 43.6%) and College (114, 33.3%). The most common employment status was unemployed (131, 38.3%) and 141 patients (41.2%) made less than $25,000 per year.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT IMPACT: Our research would be the first therapeutic to both prevent and treat osteoarthritis - helping 27 millions U.S. citizens alone immediately. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Our objective is to conjugate hyaluronic acid binding peptides (HABP) to anionic hollow nanoparticle (hNP), and allowing the HABP-hNP complex to penetrate into osteoarthritic cartilage, bind to exposed HA, prevent further degradation, and restore the compressive strength of articular cartilage. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: N-isopropyl acrylamide, 2-acrylamindo-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid, N,N’-bis(acryoyl)cystamine, and Acrylic Acid, in fluorescent batches rhodamine b isothiocyanate (RBITC), were polymerized via precipitation reaction. HA binding peptide, GAHWQFNALTVRGSG-Hydrazide (GAH-Hyd), was covalently bonded to the hNP using DMTMM chemistry. The reaction was halted by diluting the solution 10:1 with milliQ water and purified using tangential flow filtration. The dynamic viscosity of the six treatments were analyzed in a 70 kDa HA. Using a rheometer (Discovery HR-3) with a 20 mm parallel plate geometry, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE), a frequency sweep (0.01 -1000 Hz, 2.512 Pa) was conducted to measure the storage modulus of each solution. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: GAH-Hyd was successfully conjugated to the surface of the hNP and zeta-potential shows a significant increase in surface charge from -21.41 mV for unconjugated hNP to -8.94 mV for 65 GAH conjugated hNP, confirming conjugation. The hNPs need 65 ±10 GAH per nanoparticle to significantly bind to HA, shown by increasing the dynamic viscosity of the solution. The minimum concentration of 65 GAH-hNP required to significantly bind to HA is 313 µM. These data from our study display the ability to functionalized the surface of polymeric hNPs with site specific peptides and their ability to bind to diseased tissue. We expect the GAH-hNP system will restore the compressive strength of OA cartilage and prevent further HA degradation in ex vivo aggrecan depleted cartilage plugs. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Binding to exposed HA within the ECM of cartilage protects the HA from further degradation, halting the progression of OA. 65 GAH-hNP binds to HA at a 313 µM. Our system can be translated and used to treat a multitude of conditions by conjugating tissue specific peptides to the surface of our hNPs and delivery site specific therapeutics to diseases tissue.</jats:p>",

Burned children are frequently critically ill and require prolonged hospitalization with multiple surgical interventions. Pain associated with burns is severe, and failure to appropriately manage burn pain acutely can lead to long term negative consequences for these children. Prolonged opioid use, however, can lead to tolerance. While tolerance is anecdotally observed to develop at different rates in individual patients, the impact of genetic variability on the rate of development of tolerance is not known. This prospective study assesses the impact of genetic variability on opiate requirement in burned children.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A pilot study of pediatric burn patients was performed. Whole exome sequencing was used to evaluate genes involved in the metabolism and response to opioids. Oral morphine equivalents by weight (OME/kg) were calculated by day. Tolerance was determined by evaluating the rate of decline of OME/kg following the final major surgical procedure. Patients in the lowest third for rate of decline of opioid use were compared to other patients.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Nine pediatric burn patients with median total body surface area of burn of 22% (IQR 12–36) and median age 7 years (IQR 5–13) were analyzed. Significant variability in the rate of decline of OME was observed, ranging from a decline 0.0971 OMEs/kg/day to an incline of 0.0057 OME/kg/day. Patients with a rate of decline in the lower third had a high frequency of missense mutations with predicted functional impact in the mu opioid receptor: 67% had a variant predicted to have functional impact, compared to 50% of patients in the upper two thirds. Two patients overall had missense mutations with predicted functional impact in the delta opioid receptor, with one having more rapidly developed tolerance.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The rate at which pediatric burn patients develop tolerance is variable. Variants in the mu opioid receptor may contribute to the rate at which patients develop tolerance. The function of many variants identified in this study is unknown, and their contribution to the development of tolerance requires further studies. Large scale studies to evaluate the rate of variants in the population and their relationship to tolerance development are critical to formulate personalized pain management for burned children.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins arranged as two-dimensional crystals in the lipid environment provide close-to-physiological structural information, which is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms of protein function. Previously, X-ray diffraction from individual two-dimensional crystals did not represent a suitable investigational tool because of radiation damage. The recent availability of ultrashort pulses from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has now provided a means to outrun the damage. Here, we report on measurements performed at the Linac Coherent Light Source XFEL on bacteriorhodopsin two-dimensional crystals mounted on a solid support and kept at room temperature. By merging data from about a dozen single crystal diffraction images, we unambiguously identified the diffraction peaks to a resolution of 7 Å, thus improving the observable resolution with respect to that achievable from a single pattern alone. This indicates that a larger dataset will allow for reliable quantification of peak intensities, and in turn a corresponding increase in the resolution. The presented results pave the way for further XFEL studies on two-dimensional crystals, which may include pump-probe experiments at subpicosecond time resolution.",

In particular, the stacked HBT configuration can improve gain and output power while achieving a very wide bandwidth. To validate the proposed design concept, a quadruple-stacked HBT DA is designed in an indium phosphide (InP) process. The measurement results show an average gain of 16 dB from 7–115-GHz bandwidth with a maximum of 24-dBm saturated output power (Psat).

A 7-ethynyl analog leads to further structural diversification of the RNA via post-automated RNA synthesis azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions. In addition, we report preliminary studies on the effects of eight different purine 7-position modifications on RNA duplex stability and pairing specificity. Finally, the effect on RNAi activity of this type of modification at eight different positions in an siRNA guide strand has been explored. Analogs were identified with large 7-position substituents that maintain adenosine pairing specificity and are well-tolerated at specific positions in an siRNA guide strand.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a significant role in maintaining host metabolic health through the production of metabolites. Comprising one of the most abundant and diverse forms of gut metabolites, bile acids play a key role in blood glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, obesity, and energy expenditure. A central pathway in gut bacterial bile acid metabolism is the production of secondary bile acids via 7-ɑ-dehydroxylation. Despite the important role of 7-ɑ-dehydroxylation in gut bacterial bile acid metabolism and the pathophysiology of metabolic disease, the regulation of this pathway is not completely understood. This review aims to outline our current understanding of 7-ɑ-dehydroxylation and to identify key knowledge gaps that will be integral in further characterizing gut bacterial bile acid metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for treating metabolic dysregulation.",

The median injury age was 5.94 years (interquartile range (IQR)= 6.9) and had a median total body surface area of 15% (IQR = 25.5). Individual burn characteristics did not impact Peer Relationships scores; however, they did have a significant effect on Upper Extremity, Mobility, and to a lesser extent, Pain Interference scores. Older injury age (-0.24, p = 0.02), longer length of stay (-0.25, p = 0.02), larger total body surface area (-0.27, p = 0.009), and more operating room visits (-0.28, p = 0.006), were associated with worse Upper Extremity scores.

Worse Pain Interference scores were correlated with longer length of stay (0.24, p=0.01), and larger total body surface area (0.19, p=0.05).

We suggest a stepwise approach for PIPH management, starting with posaconazole dose reduction and repeat assessment of clinical and laboratory parameters. If resolution of PIPH is not achieved, an alternative triazole antifungal or the addition of an aldosterone antagonist are additional potential interventions. Even with this approach, it is possible for PIPH to persist after therapeutic modification. Thus, early diagnosis and continuous, close monitoring of patients is warranted.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>All Authors: No reported disclosures</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The (77)Se nuclides in Se-Se-Se chain sites relax faster via dipolar coupling fluctuation compared to those in Ge-Se-Ge sites shared by GeSe4 tetrahedra that relax slower via the fluctuation of the chemical shift anisotropy. The relaxation rate for the Se-Se-Se sites decreases markedly with increasing magnetic field, whereas that for the Ge-Se-Ge sites displays no appreciable dependence on the magnetic field such that the extent of differential relaxation between the two Se environments becomes small at high fields on the order of 19.6 T. The corresponding dynamical correlation time is three orders of magnitude shorter (∼10(-9) s) for the Se-Se-Se sites, compared to that for the Ge-Se-Ge sites (∼10(-6) s). The large decoupling in the time scale between these Se environments provides direct experimental support to the commonly made assumption that the selenium chains are mechanically floppy, and the interconnected GeSe4 tetrahedra form the rigid elements in the selenide glass structure.",

Because of the unique nature of burn injury, this population has largely been excluded from studies developing protocols for identification and treatment of sepsis. In our institution, the protocolized approach to sepsis starts with an alert if two SIRS criteria are met, regardless of the patient’s diagnosis. We examined whether the SIRS alert was an effective way to identify and treat sepsis in burn patients.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Patients admitted to the burn surgery service at an academic regional burn center were identified by querying the “SIRS alert” dashboard from the hospital’s quality and safety department. The dashboard is a record of every patient whose clinical status triggered a SIRS alert during hospital admission, and whether a screening order set was opened. The SIRS alert and order set usage data were analyzed directly from the dashboard. Each patient’s chart was then reviewed to decide whether there was clinical suspicion of sepsis at the time an order set was released. We determined that there was clinical suspicion of sepsis if antibiotics were initiated or escalated within 6 hours of a SIRS screening order set being opened.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>From January 1, 2019 until September 14, 2019 there were 225 patients admitted to the burn surgery service at an academic regional burn center. 70 patients, specifically receiving treatment in the burn ICU, met the criteria to trigger a SIRS alert at least once in that time. Across those 70 patients, a total of 1381 SIRS alerts were acknowledged by the nursing staff. Due to a lack of clinical suspicion for sepsis, the SIRS screening order set was opened 8.5% of the time an alert was acknowledged. Only two times in the 1381 alerts was an order set opened and then followed by the initiation or escalation of antibiotics within 6 hours.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>SIRS criteria appear to be ineffective at helping clinicians to identify and treat sepsis in the burn patient population.

However, the need for autologous skin coverage continues to be an unmet need for massive burn injuries. Several attempts have been made to address this with various dermal substitutes, temporary coverage, and skin substitutes. For 25 years, Cultured Epithelial Autografts (CEA) have been used to treat large burn injuries, but this was met with variable success and has a mandatory pre-requisite lab time before it is ready for use. In 2018, Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix (BTM) that can be placed immediately on excised burns was first studied in burn patients, which has led to its increased use in subsequent years.

    "abstract": "The G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) share a conserved heptahelical fold in the transmembrane (TM) region, but the exact arrangements of the seven TM helices vary with receptors and their activation states. The differences or the changes have been observed in the experimentally solved structures, but have not been systematically and quantitatively investigated due to lack of suitable methods. In this work, we describe a novel method, called 7×7 RMSD matrix that is proposed specifically for comparing the characteristic 7TM bundle structures of GPCRs. Compared to the commonly used overall TM bundle RMSD as a single parameter, a 7×7 RMSD matrix contains 49 parameters, which reveal changes of the relative orientations of the seven TMs. We demonstrate the novelty and advantages of this method by tackling two problems that are challenging for the existing methods. With this method, we are able to identify and quantify the helix movements in the activated receptor structures and reveal structural conservation and divergence as well as the structural relationships of different GPCRs in terms of the relative orientations of the seven TMs.",

    "abstract": "Background.Parallel transmit (pTx) has introduced many benefits to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with regard to decreased specific absorption rates and improved transmit field homogeneity, of particular importance in applications at higher magnetic field strengths. PTx has also been proposed as a solution to mitigating dangerous RF induced heating of elongated conductive devices such as those used in cardiac interventions. In this work we present a system that can augment a conventional scanner with pTx, in particular for use in interventional MRI for guidewire safety, by adjusting the amplitude and phase of each channel right before the start of the imaging pulses.Methods.The pTx system was designed to work in-line with a 1.5 T MRI while the RF synthesis and imaging control was maintained on the host MR scanner. The add-on pTx system relies on the RF transmit signal, unblanking pulse, and a protocol driven trigger from the scanner. The RF transmit was split into multiple fully modulated transmit signals to drive an array of custom transceiver coils. The performance of the 8-channel implementation was tested with regards to active and real-time control of RF induced currents on a standard guidewire, heating mitigation tests, and anatomical imaging in sheep.Results. The pTx system was intended to update RF shims in real-time and it was demonstrated that the safe RF shim could be determined while the guidewire is moved. The anatomical imaging demonstrated that cardiac anatomy and neighbouring superficial structures could be fully characterized with the pTx system inline.Conclusion.We have presented the design and performance of a real-time feedback control pTx system capable of adding such capabilities to a conventional MRI with the focus of guidewire imaging in cardiac interventional MRI applications.",

    "abstract": "Leaves, the plant organs responsible for capturing and converting most of the 170 billion metric tons of carbon fixed globally each year, can be broadly grouped into two morphological categories: simple and compound. Although simple-leaved species such as corn and Arabidopsis have traditionally been favored model systems for studying leaf development, recent years have seen an increase in genetic and molecular studies of compound leaf development. Two compound-leaved species in particular have emerged as model systems: tomato and pea. A variety of mutations which alter leaf morphology in these species have been described, and analyses of these mutations have allowed the construction of testable models of leaf development. Also, the knotted-like homeobox (KNOX) genes, which were originally discovered as regulators of meristem function, now appear to have a role in compound leaf development. In addition to the recent genetic and molecular analyses of tomato and pea, insight into the nature of compound leaf development may be gained through the study of (a) heteroblasty and heterophylly, phenomena in which a range of leaf forms can be produced by a single shoot, and (b) the evolutionary origins of compound leaves.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a quantitatively coarse-grained, but wide-ranging evaluation of the frequency recommender algorithms provide ‘good’ and ‘bad’ recommendations, with a focus on the latter. We found 151 algorithmic audits from 33 studies that report fitting risk-utility statistics from YouTube, Google Search, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Amazon, and others. Our findings indicate that roughly 8–10% of algorithmic recommendations are ‘bad’, while about a quarter actively protect users from self-induced harm (‘do good’). This average is remarkably consistent across the audits, irrespective of the platform nor on the kind of risk (bias/ discrimination, mental health and child harm, misinformation, or political extremism). Algorithmic audits find negative feedback loops that can ensnare users into spirals of ‘bad’ recommendations (or being ‘dragged down the rabbit hole’), but also highlight an even larger likelihood of positive spirals of ‘good recommendations’. While our analysis refrains from any judgment of the causal consequences and severity of risks, the detected levels surpass those associated with many other consumer products. They are comparable to the risk levels of generic food defects monitored by public authorities such as the FDA or FSIS in the United States. Consequently, our findings inform the ongoing discussion regarding regulatory oversight of the potential risks posed by recommender algorithms.",

We observed that impaired function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and increased cytokine levels of the IL-23/Th17 pathway were responsible for the psoriatic phenotype in this mouse model. Treatment of K5.hTGF-beta1 transgenic mice with PUVA suppressed the IL-23/Th17 pathway, Th1 milieu, as well as transcription factors STAT3 and orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat. PUVA induced the Th2 pathway and IL-10-producing CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs with disease-suppressive activity that was abolished by anti-CTLA4 mAb treatment. These findings were paralleled by macroscopic and microscopic clearance of the diseased murine skin. Anti-IL-17 mAb treatment also diminished the psoriatic phenotype of the mice. This indicated that both induced Tregs involving CTLA4 signaling and inhibition of the IL-23/Th17 axis are central for the therapeutic action of PUVA.",

The chemically modified base is an N(2)-alkyl-8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (alkyl = propyl, benzyl) that can alternatively pair in a Watson-Crick sense opposite cytosine (C) or as a Hoogsteen pair opposite adenine (A). Cellular delivery with C opposite led to effective targeting of A-containing but not C-containing mRNA sequences in a dual luciferase assay with RNA interference levels that were generally as good as or better than unmodified sequences. The higher activity is ascribed to an inhibitory effect of the alkyl group projecting into the minor groove of double-stranded RNA preventing off-target binding to proteins such as PKR (RNA-activated protein kinase).",

    "abstract": "An 8b 80MSample per second pipelined analog to digital converter (ADC) is designed with background calibration. The reference voltages of first two stages in the background are adjusted using monolithic calibration to compensate the gain error in the first two interstage amplifiers. The use of small capacitors and low op-amp gain is allowed in calibration at 8b level. The power dissipation is reduced, minimum required supply voltage and increase in maximum speed are the advantages offered by background calibration technology. The new technology provides advantages of improving the linearity of pipelined ADC.",
