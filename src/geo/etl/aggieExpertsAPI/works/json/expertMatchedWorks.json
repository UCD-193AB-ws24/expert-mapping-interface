    "abstract": "This study offers an early glimpse of how individuals perceive the advantagesdisadvantages of AVs their mode-use intentions and potential market segments with respect to mode use should AVs eventually become the only way to travel by car. To do so we implemented a statewide survey of Georgia residents N 2890 and using that data we applied factor analyses to two blocks of AV-related statements. The first block measured 12 perceptions of AVs and yielded two psychological constructs AV pros advantages benefits and AV overuse cons negative outcomes specifically associated with the excessive use of AVs. The second block of statements measured respondents inclinations between AV and non-AV options for 12 hypothetical transportation needs and factor analysis identified four mode-use propensity constructs AV-inclined over walkbike AV over flight zero-occupant AV over occupied AV and AV over transit. The main goal of the paper was to segment the sample on the basis of these four mode-use propensities to identify clusters with similar propensity profiles or response vectors. We applied latent class cluster analysis to do so and identified seven potential market segments some preferring AV options in general others preferring non-AV options or having unique propensity patterns based on certain contexts e.g. long distance travel and vehicle occupancy. In the model socio-demographics geography attitudes and perceptions of AVs help characterize those market segments and this provides a basis for deeper interpretation and consideration of policy implications.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Secondary malignancy is a long-term risk of radiation. External beam radiation therapy EBRT for prostate cancer treatment has been associated with later development of bladder cancer and worse bladder cancer features. OBJECTIVE We sought to provide an updated comparison of the long-term risk of bladder cancer after different localized prostate cancer treatments. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER cancer registry we compared an age-matched subset of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy RP with those who underwent EBRT brachytherapy BT EBRT BT and RP followed by EBRT RPtoEBRT between 2000 and 2018. Our final cohort included 261 609 patients with a median follow-up of 11.6 yr. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Our primary outcomes were time to bladder cancer diagnosis muscle-invasive bladder cancer diagnosis and bladder cancer death. We used cause-specific hazard models considering death as a competing event. A similar analysis was performed on lung cancer as a surrogate marker for smoking. We also compared proportions of variant histology high-grade and invasive disease among bladder cancers that occurred after radiation versus RP using chi-square testing. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS All radiation groups were associated with bladder cancer diagnosis hazard ratios HRs were 1.72 1.85 1.80 and 1.53 for EBRT BT EBRT BT and RPtoEBRT respectively using RP as a referent all p 0.001. HRs for bladder cancer death were even higher 2.39 2.57 and 3.02 for EBRT BT and EBRT BT respectively all p 0.001 except for RPtoEBRT HR 1.43 p 0.28. Lung cancer diagnosis was also associated with radiation but at lower HRs-1.63 1.32 1.42 and 1.30 for EBRT BT EBRT BT and RPtoEBRT respectively all p 0.001. There were a higher proportion of T2 T3 and sarcomatoid variant bladder cancers after radiation all p 0.01 CONCLUSIONS The risk of developing and dying from bladder cancer is increased in patients treated with radiation compared with those treated with RP. The risk was similar for BT and EBRT. Bladder cancers after radiation are more likely to be sarcomatoid variant and present as muscle invasive. PATIENT SUMMARY We observed the rates of bladder cancer after patients had undergone surgery or radiation for prostate cancer and found higher rates of bladder cancer after radiation. We also observed that bladder cancers that occur after radiation tend to be more aggressive.",

    "abstract": "California rice Oryza sativa L. growers typically use two forms of preplant N fertilizer aqua NH3 applied 7 to 10 cm below the soil surface subsurface N and surface-applied N. The rational for applying about 25 of the total N rate to the surface is to provide a readily available N source for young rice seedlings however no research has been done to verify this. On-farm field studies were conducted over a 3-yr period 12 site-years with the specific objectives of determining when rice begins to use subsurface N and to compare the efficiency of surface and subsurface applied N. Rice seedlings began accumulating subsurface N within 2 wk aft er sowing at some sites. When a portion of the N rate was applied to the surface early season plant biomass and N uptake was higher than when all of the fertilizer-N was applied subsurface. In contrast grain yields were higher when all of the N fertilizer was applied subsurface. Averaged across all sites the fertilizer-N recovery efficiency of surface-applied N was 38 compared to 53 when only subsurface N was applied. As aqua NH3 is less expensive than NH 4 based fertilizers and the application of surface N requires an additional field operation there is no justification to recommend the practice of applying surface N fertilizer in these rice systems. Instead all of the preplant N should be applied subsurface as aqua NH3. 2009 by the American Society of Agronomy.",

Initiatives have focused on increasing accrual but changes at the population-level are unknown. We examined patterns of clinical trial participation over time in AYA cancer patients. Methods We utilized medical record data from AYAs in two National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Studies identified through the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER Program. Among 1358 AYAs diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL Hodgkin lymphoma HL acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL germ cell cancer and sarcoma in 2006 and 3560 AYAs diagnosed with NHL HL ALL sarcoma and breast cancer in 20122013 we used unconditional logistic regression to evaluate patient and provider characteristics associated with enrollment by year of diagnosis. Analyses were weighted to reflect the SEER populations and associations are summarized as adjusted odds ratios OR with 95 confidence intervals CI. Results From 2006 to 20122013 clinical trial participation increased from 14.8 to 17.9 among AYAs diagnosed with NHL HL ALL and sarcoma p lt 0.0001 primarily due to increased participation among ALL patients 2006 37.4 20122013 42.3. In 20122013 participation varied by type of cancer with the highest among those with ALL and sarcoma 31.2 followed by HL 9.4 NHL 6.9 and breast cancer 4.3. In both study years multivariate analyses demonstrated that younger patients and those treated by pediatric oncologists OR 3.5 CI 2.6-4.7 were more likely to enroll onto clinical trials. Uninsured AYAs were less likely to enroll in 2006 but no association was observed in 20122013. Hispanic OR 0.5 CI 0.4-0.6 Black OR 0.6 CI 0.5-0.9 and Asian OR 0.4 CI 0.3-0.6 AYAs were less likely to enroll in 20122013 but not 2006. Conclusions Our study identified increasing overall clinical trial participation over time. Disparities in likelihood of participating for racialethnic minority groups increased suggesting the need to improve access to clinical trials for all racialethnic groups to improve care and outcomes. jatsp",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To localize and identify the gene and mutations causing autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in three consanguineous Pakistani families. METHODS Blood samples were collected and DNA was extracted. A genome-wide scan was performed by using 382 polymorphic microsatellite markers on genomic DNA from affected and unaffected family members and lod scores were calculated. RESULTS A genome-wide scan of 25 families gave an hlod 4.53 with D8S260. Retinitis pigmentosa in all three families mapped to a 14.21-cM 21.19-Mb region on chromosome 8 at q11 flanked by D8S532 and D8S260. This region harbors RP1 which is known to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Sequencing of the coding exons of RP1 showed mutations in all three families two single-base deletions c.4703delA and c.5400delA resulting in a frame shift and a 4-bp insertion c.1606insTGAA all causing premature termination of the protein. All affected individuals in these families are homozygous for the mutations. Parents and siblings heterozygous for the mutant allele did not show any signs or symptoms of RP. CONCLUSIONS These results provide strong evidence that mutations in RP1 can result in recessive as well as dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The findings suggest that truncation of RP1 before the BIF motif or within the terminal portion results in a simple loss of RP1 function producing a recessive inheritance pattern. In contrast disruption of RP1 within or immediately after the BIF domain may result in a protein with a deleterious effect and hence a dominant inheritance pattern.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and study a new percolation model inspired by recent works on jigsaw percolation graph bootstrap percolation and percolation in polluted environments. Start with an oriented graph G0 of initially occupied edges on n vertices and iteratively occupy additional oriented edges by transitivity with the constraint that only open edges in a certain random set can ever be occupied. All other edges are closed creating a set of obstacles for the spread of occupied edges. When G0 is an unoriented linear graph and leftward and rightward edges are open independently with possibly different probabilities we identify three regimes in which the set of eventually occupied edges is either all open edges the majority of open edges in one direction or only a very small proportion of all open edges. In the more general setting where G0 is a connected unoriented graph of bounded degree we show that the transition between sparse and full occupation of open edges occurs when the probability of open edges is log n-12o1. We conclude with several conjectures and open problems.",

The sensor unit comprises 12 accelerometers two on each face of a cube. The location and direction of the sensors are determined so as to locally optimize the numerical conditioning of the system of governing kinematic equations. The orientational installation error of each sensor is identified by off-line iterative processing of the gravitational acceleration measurements made at a number of known orientations of the unit thus allowing subsequent calibration. Furthermore a novel procedure is developed through which the acceleration measurements can be used to directly determine the body angular velocity this results in a major accuracy improvement over similar works whereby the angular velocity is obtained via integrating the angular acceleration. Experimental results are presented to validate the methodology design and implementation. Index TermsAcceleration measurement inertial measurement unit IMU inertial navigation. 2007 IEEE.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dry cow therapy DCT on the antimicrobial resistance AMR profile of mastitis pathogens post-calving. A repository of isolates based on a DCT trial was utilized for the current study. A stratified random survey sample of cows from the trial were identified within the strata of season herd and trial treatment resulting in 382 cows. All isolates from the 382 cows were selected for the current study which identified 566 isolates from milk samples collected at dry off S1 post-calving S2 and at the first clinical mastitis event up to 150 days in milk S3. The AMR profiles were determined using broth microdilution method. Less than 10 of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species CNS isolates n 421 were resistant to tetracycline ceftiofur penicillinnovobiocin or erythromycin while higher proportions of resistance to sulfadimethoxine 72 and penicillin 28 were observed. All Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus isolates n 4 were susceptible to all tested AMD except sulfadimethoxine to which all isolates were resistant. Similarly all Streptococcus spp. n 37 were susceptible to penicillin penicillinnovobiocin and ampicillin while resistant to tetracycline 17. All coliforms n 21 were susceptible to ceftiofur but resistance was recorded for sulfadimethoxine 70 cephalothin 56 and tetracycline 43. The increased resistance percent from S1 to S2 was observed in CNS isolates from AMD-treated cows with the highest increase recorded for penicillin 12.2. Parametric survival interval regression models were used to explore the association between antimicrobial drug AMD therapy at dry off and the AMR phenotype post-calving. The accelerated failure-time metric was adopted to minimum inhibitory concentration measurements to permit interpretation of model exponentiated coefficients. Models for cows with CNS isolated at both S1 and S2 showed increased resistance against cephalothin oxacillin and ceftiofur in cows that received DCT from the same drug class or a class with a shared resistance mechanism. In contrast resistance of CNS isolates to tetracycline were associated with any AMD therapy at dry off. Resistance of CNS isolates to Penicillin decreased in CNS isolates in cows that received any AMD therapy at dry off compared to those that didnt. The study provided evidence that dry-cow IMM AMD was associated with AMR post-calving.",

    "abstract": "Abstract On-shell methods offer an alternative definition of quantum field theory at tree-level replacing Feynman diagrams with recursion relations and interaction vertices with a handful of seed scattering amplitudes. In this paper we determine the simplest recursion relations needed to construct a general four-dimensional quantum field theory of massless particles. For this purpose we define a covering space of recursion relations which naturally generalizes all existing constructions including those of BCFW and Risager. The validity of each recursion relation hinges on the large momentum behavior of an n-point scattering amplitude under an m-line momentum shift which we determine solely from dimensional analysis Lorentz invariance and locality. We show that all amplitudes in a renormalizable theory are 5-line constructible. Amplitudes are 3-line constructible if an external particle carries spin or if the scalars in the theory carry equal charge under a global or gauge symmetry. Remarkably this implies the 3-line constructibility of all gauge theories with fermions and complex scalars in arbitrary representations all supersymmetric theories and the standard model. Moreover all amplitudes in non-renormalizable theories without derivative interactions are constructible with derivative interactions a subset of amplitudes is constructible. We illustrate our results with examples from both renormalizable and non-renormalizable theories. Our study demonstrates both the power and limitations of recursion relations as a self-contained formulation of quantum field theory.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the merger histories of isolated dwarf galaxies based on a suite of 15 highresolution cosmological zoom-in simulations all with masses of Mhalo 1010M and M 105 - 107M at z 0 from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. The stellar populations of these dwarf galaxies at z 0 are formed essentially entirely in situ over 90 per cent of the stellar mass is formed in the main progenitor in all but two cases and all 15 of the galaxies have 70 per cent of their stellar mass formed in situ. Virtually all galaxy mergers occur prior to z 3 meaning that accreted stellar populations are ancient. On average our simulated dwarfs undergo five galaxy mergers in their lifetimes with typical pre-merger galaxy mass ratios that are less than 110. This merger frequency is generally comparable to what has been found in dissipationless simulations when coupled with abundance matching. Two of the simulated dwarfs have a luminous satellite companion at z 0. These ultra-faint dwarfs lie at or below current detectability thresholds but are intriguing targets for nextgeneration facilities. The small contribution of accreted stars makes it extremely difficult to discern the effects of mergers in the vast majority of dwarfs either photometrically or using resolved-star colour-magnitude diagrams CMDs. The important implication for near-field cosmology is that star formation histories SFHs of comparably massive galaxies derived from resolved CMDs should trace the build-up of stellar mass in one main system across cosmic time as opposed to reflecting the contributions of many individual SFHs of merged dwarfs.",

Previous training increases the chance that an individual will perform CPR yet access to classes in non-English speaking populations is limited. We used a cultural adaptation approach to develop a graphic novella for Chinese LEP immigrants about how to call 911 and perform bystander CPR. Collaboration with members of this community occurred through all stages of novella development. One hundred and thirty-two LEP Chinese adults read the novella and answered a survey measuring behavioral intentions. All respondents stated they would call 911 after witnessing a persons collapse but those previously trained in CPR were more likely to say that they would perform CPR. All participants indicated that they would recommend this novella to others. Developing culturally-responsive evidence-based interventions is necessary to reduce disproportionate death and disability from cardiac arrest in LEP communities.",

We review the clinical signs of disease diagnostic findings and results of surgical and medical treatments of brainstem disease attributable to otogenic intracranial infection in cats and dogs. Eleven cats and 4 dogs were examined because of acute subacute or chronic clinical signs of brain disease including central vestibular signs altered mentation abnormal posturegait cranial nerve deficits and seizures. Results of a minimal database CBC serum biochemical panel urinalysis thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasonographic images or radiographs were within reference intervals in all animals. Magnetic resonance MR images of the head were acquired for all animals and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid CSF from 9 of 11 cats and 3 of 4 dogs was examined. Surgical exploration and ventral bulla osteotomy were done for 12 of 15 animals followed by 1-3 months of antibiotic therapy the remaining animals were euthanized before treatment. In all animals MR imaging was effective in characterizing the location and extent of the pathologic changes intracranially as well as within middleinner ear structures. Results of CSF analysis were characteristic of bacterial infection in most of the animals with acute or subacute disease. Since long-term outcome in all treated animals was very good to excellent it was concluded that dogs and cats with intracranial disease secondary to extension of otitis mediainterna have a good-to-excellent prognosis when the condition was diagnosed and was treated by surgical exploration and appropriate antibiotic therapy.",

Mixosaurus also has features that are derived within the Ichthyopterygia and unique to the genus such as a long sagittal crest reaching the nasal and an expanded anterior terrace of the upper temporal fenestra that also reaches the nasal. Phalarodon Contectopalatus and Sangiorgiosaurus are all considered as junior synonyms of Mixosaurus. The supratemporal squamosal and quadratojugal are all present in Mixosaurus atavus as in basal ichthyopterygians.

However investigation of the additional mortality risk explained by these measures over and above other factors is limited. AIM We examined whether grip strength and gait speed improve discriminative capacity for mortality over and above more readily obtainable clinical risk factors. METHODS Participants from the Health Aging and Body Composition Study Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study and the Hertfordshire Cohort Study were analysed. Appendicular lean mass ALM was ascertained using DXA muscle strength by grip dynamometry and usual gait speed over 2.4-6 m. Verified deaths were recorded. Associations between sarcopenia components and mortality were examined using Cox regression with cohort as a random effect discriminative capacity was assessed using Harrells Concordance Index C-index. RESULTS Mean SD age of participants n 8362 was 73.85.1 years 523162.6 died during a median follow-up time of 13.3 years.

METHODS We studied individual-level SES measured by self-reported education and a composite neighborhood SES nSES measure in females 1068 non-Hispanic whites 1670 Hispanics 993 African-Americans and 674 Asian-Americans ages 18 to 79 years and diagnosed 1995 to 2008 in the San Francisco Bay Area. We evaluated all-cause and breast cancer-specific survival using stage-stratified Cox proportional hazards models with cluster adjustment for census block groups. RESULTS In models adjusting for education and nSES lower nSES was associated with worse all-cause survival among African-Americans P trend 0.03 Hispanics P trend 0.01 and Asian-Americans P trend 0.01. Education was not associated with all-cause survival. For breast cancer-specific survival lower nSES was associated with poorer survival only among Asian-Americans P trend 0.01. When nSES and education were jointly considered women with low education and low nSES had 1.4 to 2.7 times worse all-cause survival than women with high education and high nSES across all racesethnicities. Among African-Americans and Asian-Americans women with high education and low nSES had 1.6 to 1.9 times worse survival respectively. For breast cancer-specific survival joint associations were found only among Asian-Americans with worse survival for those with low nSES regardless of education. CONCLUSIONS Both neighborhood and individual SES are associated with survival after breast cancer diagnosis but these relationships vary by raceethnicity. IMPACT A better understanding of the relative contributions and interactions of SES with other factors will inform targeted interventions toward reducing long-standing disparities in breast cancer survival.",

    "abstract": "In a previous article Beschta et al. Environ Manag 512474-491 2013 argue that grazing by large ungulates both native and domestic should be eliminated or greatly reduced on western public lands to reduce potential climate change impacts. The authors did not present a balanced synthesis of the scientific literature and their publication is more of an opinion article. Their conclusions do not reflect the complexities associated with herbivore grazing. Because grazing is a complex ecological process synthesis of the scientific literature can be a challenge. Legacy effects of uncontrolled grazing during the homestead era further complicate analysis of current grazing impacts. Interactions of climate change and grazing will depend on the specific situation. For example increasing atmospheric CO and temperatures may increase accumulation of fine fuels primarily grasses and thus increase wildfire risk. Prescribed grazing by livestock is one of the few management tools available for reducing fine fuel accumulation. While there are certainly points on the landscape where herbivore impacts can be identified there are also vast grazed areas where impacts are minimal. Broad scale reduction of domestic and wild herbivores to help native plant communities cope with climate change will be unnecessary because over the past 20-50 years land managers have actively sought to bring populations of native and domestic herbivores in balance with the potential of vegetation and soils. To cope with a changing climate land managers will need access to all available vegetation management tools including grazing.",

However with no AYA cancer medical specialty information on where and by whom AYAs with cancer are treated is limited. METHODS Using the National Cancer Institutes population-based AYA HOPE Study 464 AYAs aged 15-39 at diagnosis treated by 903 physicians were identified. Differences in physician and hospital characteristics were examined by age at diagnosis and cancer type germ cell cancer non-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and sarcoma using chi-square tests. RESULTS Treating physicians were predominately 51-64 years old male United States-trained in non-pediatric specialties and in group practices within large metropolitan areas. Older patients were less often treated by pediatric physicians p 0.01 and more likely to be treated by United States-trained physicians without researchteaching responsibilities and in hospitals without residency programs p 0.05. The majority of the few pediatricians n 44 treated ALL patients. Physicians with researchteaching responsibilities and those based in medical schools were more likely to treat patients with ALL and sarcoma compared with other cancer types p 0.01. Of HL patients 73 were treated at a cancer center compared with 56 of patients with germ cell cancer p 0.01 while ALL 85 and sarcoma 87 patients were more likely to be treated in hospitals with residency programs p 0.01. CONCLUSIONS Most AYAs with cancer were treated by non-pediatric physicians in community settings although physician characteristics varied significantly by patient cancer type and age at diagnosis.",

Seventeen horses with clinical infection as well as nineteen healthy herdmates all part of an EHM outbreak were enrolled in the study. Each horse was sampled two-four times at intervals of 2-6 days during the outbreak. All samples were collected using 6 rayon-tipped swabs. Nasal secretions were used as the diagnostic sample of choice. Additional samples including swabs from the muzzlenares swabs from the front limbs rectal swabs swabs of the feed bin and swabs of the water troughs were collected as well. All swabs were tested for the presence of EHV-1 by qPCR. With the exception of two EHV-1 qPCR-positive swabs from two different horses all remaining swabs collected from healthy herdmates tested qPCR-negative for EHV-1. For horses with clinical infection EHV-1 was detected in 31 nasal swabs 30 muzzlenares swabs 7 front limb swabs 7 feeders 6 water troughs and 6 rectal swabs. Not all positive muzzlenares swabs correlated with a positive nasal swab from the same set however and all other positive swabs did correlate with a positive nasal swab in their respective set. The agreement between nasal swabs and muzzlenares swabs was 74. The sampling of non-invasive swabs from the muzzlenares should facilitate the identification of EHV-1 shedders during an outbreak allowing for prompt isolation and implementation of biosecurity measures.",

Published data suggest that cancer treatment at a specialized cancer center SCC can improve survival in other cancers. Therefore we examined the impact of the location of treatment on survival in children and adolescents and young adults AYAs with STS. Methods We performed a population-based analysis of children and AYAs hospitalized within 1 year of diagnosis with first primary STS 2000-2014 using the California Cancer Registry linked with hospitalization data. Patients were categorized based on receiving all inpatient treatments at a SCC versus partnone. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors associated with overall and STS-specific survival by age group. Results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios HRs and 95 confidence intervals CIs. Results Of the 1674 patients with STS 142 were children 0-14 and 1532 were AYAs 15-39 and 89.4 and 40.4 received all inpatient treatments at a SCC respectively. Overall the 5-year survival was improved for patients who received all inpatient care at a SCC 59.8 vs. those who received partnone 50.7. Multivariable regression analysis found that having all treatments at a SCC was associated with better overall survival HR 0.79 CI 0.65-0.95 in AYAs but not in children. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that treatment for STS at a SCC is associated with better survival in AYAs. Eliminating barriers to treatment of AYAs with STS at SCCs could improve survival in this population.",

Our recently published childhood Hodgkin lymphoma HL study identified a genome-wide significant association for another genetic variant rs3781093 in high linkage disequilibrium D1.0 R20.91 with rs3824662. We hypothesize that GATA3 is a pleiotropic locus associated with multiple childhood cancers.jatsp jatspMethods The study was performed by combining 3 cohorts of childhood cancer survivors the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study SJLIFE the original and expansion cohorts of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study CCSS. The CCSS original cohort had SNP array genotyping and imputation and the SJLIFE and CCSS expansion cohort underwent whole-genome sequencing. Associations between the variants mapped to GATA3 and risks of different cancer types were analyzed a specific cancer type was selected as the case group and all other unselected cancer types served as controls then repeated for 13 cancer types. Summary statistics were subsequently analyzed with the ASSET Association analysis for SubSETs method which is powerful for pooling association signals across multiple cancer types when true effects may exist only in a subset and be in opposite directions across cancer types.jatsp jatspResults Genotype data were available for 11623 childhood cancer survivors 5325 from the CCSS original cohort 2428 from the CCSS expansion cohort and 3870 from the SJLIFE all European ancestry were initially considered. After excluding individuals with dual enrollment or as outliers in the principal components analysis n667 a total of 10956 individuals remained for genetic association analysis. We identified a bi-directional association for a subset of childhood cancers with rs3781093 2-sided P value of 6.22 1019 the same effect allele C was associated with increased risk of ALL or soft tissue sarcoma STS OR1.21 95 CI1.13-1.29 P7.4 109 and was associated with decreased risk of HL OR0.66 95 CI0.59-074 P1.80 1012. The frequencies of the effect allele C for rs3781093 in ALL cases 17.9 STS cases 17.8 and HL cases 12.5 relative to non-cancer community controls in the SJLIFE 15.6 and non-cancer gnomAD samples 14.9 corroborate this finding. In our combined dataset there were 1380 Hodgkin lymphoma cases 2961 ALL cases and 692 STS cases.jatsp jatspConclusion We discovered a novel variant in the GATA3 locus exhibiting pleiotropy with both tumor-promoting and protective effects suggesting a shared mechanistic pathway involving GATA3 may underlie the carcinogenesis for ALL STS and HL. Conducting systematic searches for childhood cancer pleiotropy represents an important research direction.jatsp jatspCitation Format Cheng Chen Xijun Zhang Qian Dong Heather L.

Elucidating the role of this interactions requires studies over an extensive range of energy momentum length and time scales. We show that immersion lens-based momentum microscopy with spin-resolution is able to combine these seemingly divergent requirements in a unifying experimental approach. We will discuss applications to different areas in information research for example resistive switching and spintronics. The analysis of resistive switching phenomena in oxides requires high lateral resolution and chemical selectivity as the processes involve local redox processes and oxygen vacancy migration. In spintronics topological phenomena are currently a hot topic which lead to complex band structures and spin textures in reciprocal space. Spin-resolved momentum microscopy is uniquely suited to address these aspects.",

Our emphasis is placed on the analysis of the simulation trajectories and some in-depth discussions are provided for commonly encountered problems.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are to assess current management algorithms for left ventricular LV hemodynamic and diastolic changes following atrial septal device occlusion in adult patients. BACKGROUND Percutaneous closure is now routine for atrial septal defects ASDs. Previous studies show ventricular size normalization following percutaneous closure. Case reports have discussed the incidence of early LV dysfunction following ASD device placement with some recommending delay of closure or placement of a fenestrated device in patients with elevated LV pressures. METHOD All adult patients with an isolated secundum ASD who underwent percutaneous repair were included in this study. In addition to placement of the Amplatzer septal occluder all patients had a pre and postprocedure transthoracic echocardiography performed measuring myocardial performance index MPI. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure LVEDP was measured before and after balloon occlusion. RESULTS Nineteen patients 17 female and two male were included in this study. Average age was 47.2 years 12.7 years. All defects were of clinical significance with average Qp Qs 2.0 0.6. Balloon occlusion led to a significant P .01 increase in LVEDP pre-LVEDP mean 7.1 mm Hg post-LVEDP mean 15.3 mm Hg. There was no significant change in MPI. ASD device size displayed a modest correlation relative to the change in LVEDP R 0.42 P .09. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous ASD closure induces an increase in LVEDP. Despite this all patients tolerated device closure without complication. It appears safe to close ASDs in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in reciprocal social interaction deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication and a restricted repertoire of activities or interests. We performed a magnetic resonance imaging study to better define the neuropathology of autistic spectrum disorders. Here we report findings on the amygdala and the hippocampal formation. Borders of the amygdala hippocampus and cerebrum were defined and their volumes were measured in male children 7.5-18.5 years of age in four diagnostic groups autism with mental retardation autism without mental retardation Asperger syndrome and age-matched typically developing controls. Although there were no differences between groups in terms of total cerebral volume children with autism 7.5-12.5 years of age had larger right and left amygdala volumes than control children. There were no differences in amygdala volume between the adolescent groups 12.75-18.5 years of age. Interestingly the amygdala in typically developing children increases substantially in volume from 7.5 to 18.5 years of age. Thus the amygdala in children with autism is initially larger but does not undergo the age-related increase observed in typically developing children. Children with autism with and without mental retardation also had a larger right hippocampal volume than typically developing controls even after controlling for total cerebral volume. Children with autism but without mental retardation also had a larger left hippocampal volume relative to controls. These cross-sectional findings indicate an abnormal program of early amygdala development in autism and an abnormal pattern of hippocampal development that persists through adolescence. The cause of amygdala and hippocampal abnormalities in autism is currently unknown.",

SSRs presented a high level of polymorphism and greater information content as assessed by the expected hetrozygosity compared to AFLPs and RAPDs. The lowest values of expected hetrozygosity were obtained for AFLPs however AFLPs showed the highest efficiency owing to their capacity to reveal large numbers of bands per reaction which led to high values for various types of indices of diversity. All the three techniques discriminated almond genotypes very effectively except that SSRs failed to discriminate between Monagha and Sefied almond genotypes. The correlation coefficients of similarity were statistically significant for all the three marker systems but were lower for the SSR data than for RAPDs and AFLPs. For all the markers high similarity in dendrogram topologies was obtained although some differences were observed. All the dendrograms including that obtained by the combined use of all the marker data reflect relationships for most of cultivars according to their geographic diffusion. AMOVA detected more variation among cultivated and related wild species of almond within each geographic group. Bootstrap analysis revealed that the number of markers used was sufficient for reliable estimation of genetic similarity and for meaningful comparisons of marker types.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE A recent report suggested improvements in survival after follicular lymphoma FL but not for all racialethnic groups. To better understand the reasons for these FL survival differences we examined the joint influences of diagnostic period raceethnicity and neighborhood socioeconomic status SES on survival in a large population-based case series. METHODS All patients n 15937 diagnosed with FL between 1988 and 2005 in California were observed for vital status through November 2007. Overall and FL-specific survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression. Neighborhood SES was assigned from United States Census data using residence at diagnosis. RESULTS Overall and FL-specific survival improved 22 and 37 respectively from 1988 to 1997 to 1998 to 2005 and were observed in all racialethnic groups. AsianPacific Islanders had better survival than non-Hispanic white Hispanic and black patients who had similar outcomes. Lower neighborhood SES was associated with worse survival in patients across all stages of disease P for trend .01. Patients with the lowest SES quintile had a 49 increased risk of death from all causes hazard ratio HR 1.49 95 CI 1.30 to 1.72 and 31 increased risk of death from FL HR 1.31 95 CI 1.06 to 1.60 than patients with the highest SES. CONCLUSION Evolving therapies have likely led to improvements in survival after FL. Although improvements have occurred within all racialethnic groups lower neighborhood SES was significantly associated with substantially poorer survival.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Few previous studies investigating depression before the diagnosis of breast cancer and breast cancer-specific mortality have examined depression measured at more than 1 time point. This study investigated the effect of depression combining depressive symptoms alone with antidepressant use measured at 2 time points before the diagnosis of breast cancer on all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality among older postmenopausal women. METHODS A large prospective cohort the Womens Health Initiative was used. The study included 3095 women with incident breast cancer who had measures of depressive symptoms and antidepressant use before their diagnosis at the baseline and at year 3. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios HRs between depression at the baseline depression at year 3 and combinations of depression at these time points and all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS Depression at year 3 before a breast cancer diagnosis was associated with higher all-cause mortality after adjustments for multiple covariates HR 1.35 95 confidence interval CI 1.02-1.78. There was no statistically significant association of baseline depression and all-cause mortality or breast cancer-specific mortality whether or not depression was also present at year 3. In women with late-stage regional- or distant-stage breast cancer newly developed depression at year 3 was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality HR 2.00 95 CI 1.13-3.56 and breast cancer-specific mortality HR 2.42 95 CI 1.24-4.70. CONCLUSIONS Women with newly developed depression before the diagnosis of breast cancer had a modestly but significantly increased risk for death from any cause and for death from breast cancer at a late stage.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES Management of the airway in an emergency may be a harrowing experience. The equipment necessary to perform this procedure is often inaccessible. The LifeStat emergency airway is a portable device approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for emergency cricothyrotomy. It is small enough to secure to a keychain thus allowing instantaneous access at all times. We present a retrospective case series to report the experience of clinicians who have used the LifeStat device. METHODS A survey instrument was sent to a convenience sample of health-care professionals who purchased the LifeStat emergency airway. The survey queried device use user demographics and the success ease complications and location of use. RESULTS One thousand surveys were distributed and 100 individuals responded. Fifteen percent 15 of 100 reported use of the device on 17 occasions. The LifeStat was used successfully in all 17 cases. Eighty-two percent 14 of 17 of emergency use was in hospitals. In all cases the device was positioned successfully on the first attempt. No complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS The LifeStat device provides a relatively safe and effective means of performing emergency cricothyrotomy. The majority of emergency situations in which the device was deployed occurred in hospital settings.",

Most research regarding hormones and neurogenesis has been performed on non-primate species. To determine whether gonadal hormones can modulate endogenous neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus DG of the hippocampus in non-human primates ovariectomized OVX female rhesus monkeys received continuous unopposed beta-estradiol OVX-E-Con cyclic unopposed beta-estradiol OVX-E-Cyc continuous beta-estradiolcyclic progesterone OVX-E-ConP-Cyc or control OVX-Veh treatments. At week 29 all monkeys received BrdU injections for 4 consecutive days in addition to the ongoing treatment. Twenty days after the last BrdU injection all animals were sacrificed for tissue collection. In DG of hippocampus scattered BrdU-ir cells were observed mainly in the subgranular zone SGZ and in the granule cell layer and occasionally these BrdU-ir cells in the SGZ formed clusters containing between 2 and 5 cells. In the granule cell layer and SGZ virtually none of the BrdU-ir cells were either Dcx a marker of immature neurons or GFAP positive. However an occasional BrdU-ir cell was positive for both neuronal marker NeuN or beta III-tubulin. Unbiased stereological analysis of BrdU-ir cells within the SGZ and the granule cell layer of DG revealed that among the experimental groups there was no significant difference in number of BrdU-ir cells within the SGZ and the granule cell layer of the DG OVX-E-Con 1801-218.7 OVX-E-Cyc 1783-415.6 OVX-E-Con-P-Cyc 1721-229.6 and OVX-Veh 1263-106.3 but a trend towards increased BrdU-ir cells was observed in all the experimental groups.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled blinded cross-over experimental study. ANIMALS A total of eight healthy adult neutered male cats. METHODS Cats were administered five IM treatments at least 2 weeks apart consisting of dexmedetomidine 25 g kg-1 D25 MK-467 600 g kg-1 M600 and D25 combined with 300 600 and 1200 g kg-1 of MK-467 D25M300 D25M600 and D25M1200 respectively. Heart rate and direct arterial blood pressure were recorded via telemetry and sedation assessed prior to treatments and at intervals for 8 hours thereafter. RESULTS Heart rate decreased significantly after all treatments with dexmedetomidine and remained below baseline up to 240 D25 20 D25M300 and 3 minutes D25M600 and D25M1200. Mean arterial pressure MAP increased with D25 remained unchanged with M600 and decreased over time with all combination treatments. The highest and lowest MAP after each treatment were 16817 and 10014 D25 15718 and 7911 D25M300 15311 and 7410 D25M600 14412 and 697 D25M1200 and 1369 and 10413 mmHg M600. All treatments with dexmedetomidine produced sedation although its duration was significantly reduced by the addition of MK-467. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dexmedetomidine induced bradycardia and hypertension which were attenuated by all three doses of MK-467. The duration of sedation was reduced by MK-467. MK-467 may improve the cardiovascular tolerance of IM dexmedetomidine in cats.",

However it is important to distinguish what is the target of selection vs. what is transmitted across generations. Physical traits behaviors and the extended phenotype are all selected features of an individual but genes that covary with different aspects of the targets of selection are inherited. Here we review the variability in cortical organization morphology and behavior that have been observed across species and describe similar types of variability within species. We examine sources of variability and the constraints that limit the types of changes that evolution has and can produce. Finally we underscore the importance of how genes and genetic regulatory networks are deployed and interact within an individual and their relationship to external physical forces within the environment that shape the ultimate phenotype.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a multigrid block-based preconditioner for solving linear systems arising from a Discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the all-speed Navier-Stokes equations with phase change. The equations are discretized in conservative form with a reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin rDG method and integrated with fully-implicit time discretization schemes. To robustly converge the numerically stiff systems we use the Newton-Krylov framework with a primitive-variable formulation pressure velocity and temperature which is better conditioned than the conservative-variable form at low-Mach number. In the limit of large acoustic CFL number and viscous Fourier number there is a strong coupling between the velocity-pressure system and the linear systems become non-diagonally dominant. To effectively solve these ill-conditioned systems an approximate block factorization preconditioner is developed which uses the Schur complement to reduce a 33 block system into a sequence of two 22 block systems velocity-pressure vP and velocity-temperature vT. We compare the performance of the vP-vT Schur complement preconditioner to classic preconditioning strategies monolithic algebraic multigrid AMG element-block SOR and primitive variable block Gauss-Seidel. The performance of the preconditioned solver is investigated in the limit of large CFL and Fourier numbers for low-Mach lid-driven cavity flow Rayleigh-Bnard melt convection compressible internally heated convection and 3D laser-induced melt pool flow. Numerical results demonstrate that the vP-vT Schur complement preconditioned solver scales well both algorithmically and in parallel and is robust for highly ill-conditioned systems for all tested rDG discretization schemes up to 4th-order.",

We assessed the presence of anthropogenic debris in fishes and shellfish on sale for human consumption. We sampled from markets in Makassar Indonesia and from California USA. All fish and shellfish were identified to species where possible. Anthropogenic debris was extracted from the digestive tracts of fish and whole shellfish using a 10 KOH solution and quantified under a dissecting microscope. In Indonesia anthropogenic debris was found in 28 of individual fish and in 55 of all species. Similarly in the USA anthropogenic debris was found in 25 of individual fish and in 67 of all species. Anthropogenic debris was also found in 33 of individual shellfish sampled. All of the anthropogenic debris recovered from fish in Indonesia was plastic whereas anthropogenic debris recovered from fish in the USA was primarily fibers. Variations in debris types likely reflect different sources and waste management strategies between countries. We report some of the first findings of plastic debris in fishes directly sold for human consumption raising concerns regarding human health.",

    "abstract": "Ecological rarity characterized by low abundance or limited distribution is typical of most species yet our understanding of what factors contribute to the persistence of rare species remains limited. Consequently little is also known about whether rare species might respond differently than common species to direct e.g. abiotic and indirect e.g. biotic effects of climate change. We investigated the effects of warming and exclusion of large herbivores on 14 tundra taxa three of which were common and 11 of which were rare at an inland low-arctic study site near Kangerlussuaq Greenland. Across all taxa pooled commonness was reduced by experimental warming and more strongly under herbivore exclusion than under herbivory. However taxon-specific analyses revealed that although warming elicited variable effects on commonness herbivore exclusion disproportionately reduced the commonness of rare taxa. Over the 15-year duration of the experiment we also observed trends in commonness and rarity under all treatments through time. Sitewide commonness increased for two common taxa the deciduous shrubs Betula nana and Salix glauca and declined in six other taxa all of which were rare. Rates of increase or decline in commonness i.e. temporal trends over the duration of the experiment were strongly related to baseline commonness of taxa early in the experiment under all treatments except warming with grazing. Hence commonness itself may be a strong predictor of species responses to climate change in the arctic tundra biome but large herbivores may mediate such responses in rare taxa perhaps facilitating their persistence.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of the extraordinary inflation mechanism of pufferfishes was studied in the light of an independently derived phylogenetic hypothesis of tetraodontiform fishes. Inflation behavior is found in all members of the puffer sister taxa Tetraodontidae and Diodontidae. However most other tetraodontiform fishes exhibit two functionally similar behaviors. All taxa exhibit a coughing behavior and with the exception of the sister-group to all other tetraodontiforms represented by the Triacanthidae all lineages blow strong jets of water out of their mouth to excavate prey. Functional specializations associated with the three behaviors were identified from anatomical analyses and electromyographic recordings of muscle activity in representatives of the major lineages of the order. The phylogenetic distribution of the three buccal compression behaviors and their functional bases indicates the following 1 the evolution of inflation behavior involved major structural modifications of the head that function in a novel mechanism that links depression of the floor of the mouth to posterior expansion of the buccal cavity 2 the contraction patterns of four key head muscles used in the three behaviors are generally similar both across behaviors and taxa 3 however the distribution of the two significant modifications of muscle activity are consistent with the hypothesis that the three behaviors represent a transformation series from coughing to water blowing to inflation. The motor pattern for water blowing is a slightly modified version of that seen in coughing and the inflation motor pattern retains the blowing specialization and adds a single additional modification. The convergent evolution of a poorly developed inflation behavior in at least one genus of filefish provides evidence that tetraodontiform fishes are predisposed to the evolution of this unusual defensive behavior. The presence of a well developed water-blowing behavior in most tetraodontiform lineages may represent an intermediate functional specialization that increased the probability of the evolution of inflation.",

Global soil change raises important questions about the future of soil the environment and human society. Although many soil scientists strive to understand human forcings as integral to soil genesis there remains an explicit need for a science of anthropedology to detail how humanity is a fully fledged soil-forming factor and to understand how soil change affects human well being. The development and maturation of anthropedology is critical to achieving land-use sustainability and needs to be nurtured by all soil disciplines with inputs from allied sciences and the humanities. The Soil Science Society of America SSSA has recently approved a cross-divisional Working Group on Soil Change which aims to advance the basic and applied science of anthropedology to facilitate networks of scientists long-term soil field studies and regional databases and modeling and to engage in new modes of communications about human-soil relations.

Moreover while a MDACC study demonstrated that the combination of ponatinib plus hyper-CVAD produced remarkable activity in untreated Ph ALL it remains to be externally validated. We sought to validate those findings in previously untreated adult patients with Ph ALL. METHODS This was a retrospective study analyzing the outcomes of previously untreated adult ALL patients treated with hyper-CVAD with a focus on Ph ALL patients treated with ponatinib plus hyper-CVAD. RESULTS 82 patients were included. The median age was 51 years. The median follow-up was 2.62 years. The 5-year overall survival OS and event-free survival EFS were 39.5 and 28.2 respectively. For Ph ALL patients n 13 receiving ponatinib plus hyper-CVAD 3-year OS and EFS were both 92.3 . Univariate analysis showed a high WBC and poor-risk cytogenetics to be associated with inferior outcomes while CD20 predicted favorable outcomes in B-ALL patients. On multivariate analysis CD20 retained significance for Philadelphia-negative Ph- ALL. For Ph ALL ponatinib was associated with better OS and EFS on univariate and multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Our data supports the use of ponatinib plus hyper-CVAD as a standard of care regimen for Ph ALL. Our outcomes for Ph-ALL and T-cell ALL T-ALL show that advances are still needed in the frontline setting and clinical trial enrollment is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Anesthesia can affect measured thyroxine total T4 concentrations in humans and animals but its effect in black-tailed prairie dogs Cynomys ludovicianus has not yet been studied. We used isoflurane to anesthetize 12 prairie dogs for 60 min. Blood samples were obtained from each animal immediately after anesthesia induction and at 30 and 60 min and used for analysis of plasma T4 concentration. The plasma T4 concentration mean 1 SD was significantly decreased from baseline 3.49 0.52 gdL at both 30 min 3.24 0.52 gdL and 60 min 3.27 0.65 gdL after induction. Compared with baseline some of the T4 trends were inconsistent between animals and individual variability in response was responsible for 86 of the overall variability. Regardless of the observed change under isoflurane anesthesia all measurements in all prairie dogs and at all time points 2.4 to 4.4 gdL were within the reported normal plasma T4 reference range for this species. In conclusion isoflurane anesthesia appears to cause a significant but inconsistent reduction in plasma T4 concentrations in black-tailed prairie dogs but because values remain within normal basal levels the clinical importance of this effect is likely minimal.",

Results suggest that people manage their online self-presentation in ways that are consistent with lowest common denominator imagined audience and accommodation propositions. Network size was positively associated with the proportion of positive emotional language and negatively with negative emotional language whereas heterogeneity had the opposite effect.",

Animals were divided into five groups and treated for 6 hours with either crystalloid control group or mannitol albumin furosemide or albuminfurosemide treatment groups. The cerebral effects of therapy were evaluated by intracranial pressure ICP measurements and by postmortem evaluations of water content using computerized tomography CT density measurements and wet-dry weight measurements. The ICP was significantly reduced by all treatments except albumin alone and was reduced equally by mannitol furosemide and albuminfurosemide. The CT density of the lesion area was significantly increased by all treatments. The density of the contralateral nonlesioned hemisphere was significantly increased by all treatments except albumin. The water content of the lesion area was significantly decreased by all treatments water content of the opposite hemisphere was not significantly reduced. The systemic effects of therapy were evaluated by measuring net fluid balance wedge pressures hematocrits free water clearance and vasopressin. Negative fluid balance without an increase in hematocrit or in vasopressin secretion occurred only in dogs treated with albuminfurosemide. Such oncodiuretic therapy seems to cause normovolemic dehydration and to have cerebral effects similar to mannitol and furosemide without their undesirable systemic effects.",

HYPOTHESIS Preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 predicts the risk of future all-cause death and cardiovascular death among patients submitted to elective coronary artery bypass surgery. METHODS From a cohort of 312 patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery prospectively followed for a median of 6.7 years we evaluated the prognostic role of preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 inflammatory markers CHA2DS2-VASc score and development of postoperative atrial fibrillation POAF. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to establish an association of these parameters with long term all-cause death and cardiovascular death. RESULTS During 2112 person-years of follow-up we observed 41 deaths 10 were cardiovascular deaths. Independently increased levels of preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 POAF and CHA2DS2-VASc score were associated with all-cause mortality. After multivariate adjustment elevated preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and POAF were the only independent predictors of all-cause death. Also preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 POAF and CHA2DS2-VASc score resulted in being independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS Increased circulating levels of preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 together with POAF and CHA2DS2-VASc score were significantly associated with future all-cause death and cardiovascular death among patients submitted to coronary artery bypass surgery.",

All clinical signs resolved in 18-48 hours with supportive care. One dog represented with similar clinical signs and biochemical abnormalities 3 days after discharge following spending time in a different rice field owned by the same owner. Toxicological analysis of serum from all 3 dogs and vomitus from 1 dog returned positive for amitraz and one of its metabolites. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED This is the first case series of dogs with confirmed amitraz toxicosis following an environmental exposure. Novel biochemical findings of hyperlactatemia respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis were documented in all 3 dogs. Clinicians should be concerned for amitraz toxicosis when presented with an animal with the constellation of signs including decreased mental status bradycardia and hyperglycemia particularly if relevant acid-base abnormalities are also detected.",

    "abstract": "Host defense against the parasite Toxoplasma gondii requires the cytokine interferon-gamma IFN. However Toxoplasma inhibits the host cell transcriptional response to IFN which is thought to allow the parasite to establish a chronic infection. It is not known whether all strains of Toxoplasma block IFN-responsive transcription equally and whether this inhibition occurs solely through the modulation of STAT1 activity or whether other transcription factors are involved. We find that strains from three North AmericanEuropean clonal lineages of Toxoplasma types I II and III can differentially modulate specific aspects of IFN signaling through the polymorphic effector proteins ROP16 and GRA15. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation is activated in the absence of IFN by the Toxoplasma kinase ROP16 but this ROP16-activated STAT1 is not transcriptionally active. Many genes induced by STAT1 can also be controlled by other transcription factors and therefore using these genes as specific readouts to determine Toxoplasma inhibition of STAT1 activity might be inappropriate. Indeed GRA15 and ROP16 modulate the expression of subsets of IFN responsive genes through activation of the NF-BIRF1 and STAT36 transcription factors respectively. However using a stable STAT1-specific reporter cell line we show that strains from the type I II and III clonal lineages equally inhibit STAT1 transcriptional activity. Furthermore all three of the clonal lineages significantly inhibit global IFN induced gene expression.",

Emergency department records operative logs and blood transfusion data from arrival to procedure end were analyzed using multivariate regression techniques. Triggers included systolic blood pressure SBP 90 mm Hg hemoglobin 11 gdL temperature 35.5C International normalized ratio INR 1.5 and base deficit 6. RESULTS One hundred seventy patients required immediate operation with an overall survival of 91. Transfusion of packed red blood cells was noted in 45 77 of 170 with the mean number of transfused units highest in those meeting SBP 12.9 Units or INR 12.3 Units triggers. The triggers do not contribute equal predictive value for the need for transfusion with INR being the most predictive odds ratio 16.7 95 confidence interval 2-137 for any transfusion and highly predictive for the need for MT odds ratio 11.3 95 confidence interval 3-47. In fact if patients met either INR or SBP triggers alone they were likely to receive MT p 0.018 and 0.003 respectively. CONCLUSION Triggers have differential predictive values for need for transfusion. Defining the individual utility of each criterion will help to identify those most likely to benefit from an early initiation of the MTP.",

We used demographic clinical and survival data on AYAs enrolled on CALGB 10403 N 295 2007-2012. Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registries provided overall survival OS for US AYA ALL by ethnicityrace. North American Association of Cancer Registries provided AYA ALL incidence overall and proportion among Hispanics by US state.

Compared with NHWs Hispanic and NHB patients had lower household income and Hispanic patients were more likely to harbor high-risk CRLF2 aberrations. Relative to US estimates where Hispanic patients represented 46 of newly diagnosed AYA ALL patients and experienced inferior OS compared with NHW P .001 Hispanic AYAs on CALGB 10403 did as well as NHW patients 3 year OS 75 vs 74 P NS. Hispanic patients also had higher rates of protocol completion P .05. Enrollments on CALGB 10403 differed relative to the distribution of Hispanic AYA ALL in the United States enrollment was highest in the Midwest t and only 15 of enrollees were from states with a high proportion of Hispanic AYA ALL patients. In summary Hispanic patients treated on CALGB 10403 did as well as NHWs and better than population estimates. Geographical misalignment between trial sites and disease epidemiology may partially explain the lower-than-expected enrollment of Hispanic AYA ALL patients.",

    "abstract": "All-terrain vehicle ATV crashes are among the leading causes of injury and death among youth in the agriculture industry. It is hypothesised that youth are involved in ATV-related incidents because they cannot effectively activate the vehicles controls. This study evaluated potential discrepancies between the required activation forces of the controls of fifty-four utility ATVs and the strength of male-and-female youth of varying ages 6-20 years old and strength percentiles 5th 50th and 95th. The activation forces of the ATVs controls were measured experimentally while the youths corresponding strength was retrieved from the literature. The results of this study demonstrated a physical mismatch between the forces required to operate ATV controls and youths strength. Turning the handlebar pressing the footbrake and pushing the ATV off are the most difficult tasks for ATV operation. These discrepancies compromise the youths ability to ride ATVs increasing their risk of crashes. Practitioner summary Previous studies indicate that some youth engage in ATV incidents because they cannot activate the vehicles controls. We measured the forces required to operate eight ATV controls and compared them with the youths corresponding strength. Our results demonstrated physical mismatches between the forces required to operate ATV controls and the youths strength.",

    "abstract": "Across the United States cities are creating sustainability and climate action plans CAPs that call to increase local vegetation. These greening initiatives have the potential to not only benefit the environment but also human health. In epidemiologic literature greenness has a protective effect on mortality through various direct and indirect pathways. We aimed to assess how an increase in greenness could decrease mortality in the largest urban areas in the United States. We conducted a nationwide quantitative health impact assessment to estimate the predicted reduction in mortality associated with an increase in greenness across two decades 2000 2010 and 2019. Using a recently published exposure-response function Landsat 30 m 16-day satellite imagery from April to September and publicly available county-level mortality data from the CDC we calculated the age-adjusted reduction in all-cause mortality for those 65 years and older within 35 of the most populated metropolitan areas. We estimated that between 34000 and 38000 all-cause deaths could have been reduced in 2000 2010 and 2019 with a local increase in green vegetation by 0.1 unit across the most populated metropolitan areas. We found that overall greenness increased across time with a 2.86 increase from 2000 to 2010 to 11.11 from 2010 to 2019. These results can be used to support CAPs by providing a quantitative assessment to the impact local greening initiatives can have on mortality. Urban planners and local governments can use these findings to calculate the co-benefits of local CAPs through a public health lens and support policy development.",

    "abstract": "Ambient PM2.5 was collected during the winter season from Taiyuan Shanxi China Jinan Shandong China and Sacramento California USA and used to create PMSX PMSD and PMCA extracts respectively. Time-lag experiments were performed to explore the in vivo and in vitro toxicity of the PM extracts. In vivo inflammatory lung responses were assessed in BALBc mice using a single oropharyngeal aspiration OPA of PM extract or vehicle CTRL on Day 0. Necropsies were performed on Days 1 2 and 4 post-OPA and pulmonary effects were determined using bronchoalveolar lavage BAL and histopathology. On Day 1 BAL neutrophils were significantly elevated in all PM- versus CTRL-exposed mice with PMCA producing the strongest response. However histopathological scoring showed greater alveolar and perivascular effects in PMSX-exposed mice compared to all three other groups. By Day 4 BAL neutrophilia and tissue inflammation were resolved similar across all groups. In vitro effects were examined in human HepG2 hepatocytes and U937 cells following 6 24 or 48 h of exposure to PM extract or DMSO control. Luciferase reporter and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine in vitro effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR activation and gene transcription respectively. Though all three PM extracts activated AhR PMSX produced the greatest increases in AhR activation and mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 cytochrome P450 interleukin IL-8 and interleukin IL-1. These effects were assumed to result from a greater abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs in PMSX compared to PMSD and PMCA.",

The ultimate goal of steganalysis is two-fold making a binary classification of a file as stego-bearing or innocent and secondly locating the hidden message with an aim to extracting sterilizing or manipulating it. Almost all steganalysis approaches known as attacks focus on the first of these two issues. In this paper we explore the difficult related problem given that we know an image file contains steganography locate which pixels contain the message. We treat the hidden message location problem as outlier detection using probabilityenergy measures of images motivated by the image restoration community. Pixels contributing the most to the energy calculations of an image are deemed outliers. Typically of the top third of one percent of most energized pixels outliers we find that 87 are stego-bearing in color images and 61 in grayscale images. In all image types only 1 of all pixels are stego-bearing indicating our techniques provides a substantial lift over random guessing.",

    "abstract": "Mortality patterns in an old-growth mixed-conifer forest in the absence of wildfire were investigated at the Teakettle Experimental Forest from 2000 to 2002. We tested the hypothesis that after a century of fire suppression pathogen- and insect-associated mortality between episodic droughts would be significantly greater on ingrowth trees i.e. smaller-diameter shade-tolerant species in high-density clusters. Using a survey of over 30000 mapped trees overall mortality as measured by standing dead trees was 8.7 of all stems 5 cm dbh. Mortality levels were proportional to the population size of the five dominant conifer species white fir Abies concolor red fir A. magnified incense cedar Calocedrus decurrens Jeffrey pine Pinus jeffreyi and sugar pine Pinus lambertiana. There was also no significant difference in mortality between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species. All dead trees were clustered within plots. Mortality was significantly higher than expected for large-diameter trees 100 cm dbh with all conifer species combined and for each individual species except Jeffrey pine. Small-diameter dead trees were grouped in high-density clusters. Mortality was less than expected among small-diameter trees 5-20 cm dbh for all species combined red and white fir and sugar pine. Mortality for all conifers was higher than expected in areas of high stand density and lower in areas of low stand density. Mortality of small-diameter trees was clustered and particularly high in areas of high stand density. Our data suggest pathogen- and insect-associated mortality is significantly greater in areas of high stand density but it is not higher for shade-tolerant species. Furthermore mortality is higher than expected for large-diameter trees suggesting an acceleration of old-tree mortality under current fire suppression conditions.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In 2018 the Leapfrog Group set minimum annual lung cancer surgery hospital and surgeon volume thresholds of 40 and 15 respectively. We examined whether outcomes associated with these Leapfrog Group volume thresholds are comparable for patients at the extremes of age and comorbidities. METHODS We assessed lung cancer patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy in the New York and Florida State Inpatient Databases for 2007 to 2013. Multivariate logit models evaluated in-hospital mortality complications and prolonged length of stay. Median surgeon and hospital volumes were compared between younger-healthier age 18-60 years Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 1 and older-sicker patients age 77 years Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 3. RESULTS The 27841 patients included 13277 men 48. The median patient age was 69 years interquartile range 61-77 and mortality was 2.1. Patients treated by both low-volume surgeons 15 annual cases and at low-volume hospitals 40 had the greatest risk of mortality 2.5 except for the cohort of younger-healthier patients mortality 2. Mortality for older-sicker patients was highest for high-volume surgeons 12 although higher hospital volume was protective. Increasing hospital volume was associated with decreased mortality odds ratio OR 0.997 95 confidence interval CI 0.995-0.998 P .0103 complications OR 0.998 95 CI 0.997-0.999 P .001 and prolonged length of stay OR 0.998 95 CI 0.997-1.00 P .01 similarly higher surgeon volume was associated with decreased mortality OR 0.997 95 CI 0.99-1.00 P .03 complications OR 0.997 95 CI 0.994-1.00 P .02 and prolonged length of stay OR 0.991 95 CI 0.986-0.995 P .01. CONCLUSIONS Hospital volume has a greater effect on morbidity and mortality than surgeon volume especially for older-sicker patients suggesting that Leapfrog Group volume guidelines should emphasize hospital volume over surgeon volume and may be less relevant for younger-healthier patients.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare three models of pediatric physiatry care in-person hybrid and all-virtual in terms of parent experience and physician- and therapist-reported quality of care. We hypothesized that the all-virtual model would have lower parent experience scores and lower quality scores compared with the other two models of care. METHODS We designed a convergent parallel mixed methods study incorporating a cluster-randomized crossover design. Quantitative data included surveys of parents physicians and therapists after visits to 13 medical therapy units in Northern California between January 2020 and January 2022. Qualitative data were collected in six focus groups with parents physicians and therapists. RESULTS A total of 2455 visits were completed for 1281 unique children during the study period including 507 in-person visits 246 hybrid visits and 1702 all-virtual visits. There were no differences in parent experience scores between the three models of care. Physicians and therapists rated all-virtual visits significantly lower in terms of quality of care parent education and physical exam compared with the other two models of care but qualitative results highlighted specific instances where all-virtual visits could be useful. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that parents therapists and physicians find a hybrid virtual model is an acceptable model of care that maintains the quality of care and facilitates parent education. All-virtual models may be appropriate for specific circumstances but are perceived as lower quality. Research exploring implementation of these models would be valuable for providing practical guidance in the future.",

    "abstract": "The study of the holotype and of a new specimen of Nanchangosaurus suni Reptilia Diapsida Hupehsuchia revealed a suite of hitherto unrecognized characters. For example Nanchangosaurus has bipartite neural spines and its vertebral count is nearly identical to that of Hupehsuchus. It differs from the latter in having poorly developed forelimbs despite the advanced ossification in the rest of the skeleton. Other differences all pertain to hupehsuchian plesiomorphies retained in Nanchangosaurus such as low neural spines. The relationship of Hupehsuchia within Diapsida was analyzed based on a data matrix containing 41 taxa coded for 213 characters of which 18 were identified as aquatic adaptations from functional inferences. These aquatic adaptations may be vulnerable to the argumentation of character homology because expectation for homoplasy is high. There is an apparent incongruence between phylogenetic signals from aquatic adaptations and the rest of the data with aquatic adaptations favoring all marine reptiles but Helveticosaurus to form a super-clade. However this super-clade does not obtain when aquatic adaptations were deleted whereas individual marine reptile clades are all derived without them. We examined all possible combinations of the 18 aquatic adaptations n 262143 and found that four lineages of marine reptiles are recognized almost regardless of which of these features were included in the analysis Hupehsuchia-Ichthyopterygia clade Sauropterygia-Saurosphargidae clade Thalattosauria and Helveticosaurus. The interrelationships among these four depended on the combination of aquatic adaptations to be included i.e. assumed to be homologous a priori by bypassing character argumentation. Hupehsuchia always appeared as the sister taxon of Ichthyopterygia.",

The fundamental hypothesis is that the process of nucleotide substitution as revealed by the minimum phyletic distance procedure Fitch 1971 is Poisson with a constant time average for each protein. The method allows the simultaneous estimation of the relative times of divergence of all common ancestors while utilizing the information from all four proteins. It also affords the possibility of statistically testing several biologically meaningful hypotheses. The results are the following 1. The total rate sum of all proteins of nucleotide substitution is not constant in time throughout the evolution of vertebrates. 2. The relative rates among proteins of nucleotide substitution are not constant throughout vertebrate evolution. 3. Despite the variation in the rates of nucleotide substitution the procedure employed provides estimates of the relative time of divergence which correlate well with paleontological dates. 4. The overall rate of nucleotide substitution within the primates is again found to be less than the rest of the mammals. 1974 Springer-Verlag.",

This requires complex large studies to measure how plant genotypes simultaneously interact with a diverse array of environmental stimuli. Successful interpretation of the results from these studies requires us to transition away from the traditional standard of conducting an array of pairwise t tests toward more general linear modeling structures such as those provided by the extendable ANOVA framework. In this Perspective we present arguments for making this transition and illustrate how it will help to avoid incorrect conclusions in factorial interaction studies genotype genotype genotype treatment and treatment treatment or higher levels of interaction that are becoming more prevalent in this new era of plant biology.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the two popular medium rice varieties namely M202 and M206 in California have different fissuring resistances. Therefore the main goal of this study was to investigate the sorption behavior of these two varieties by a new approach using dynamic vapor sorption DVS method for elucidating the differences in fissuring resistance. The moisture sorption isotherms of rough brown and white rice and husk were determined at 25 C over a water activity range of 0-0.98. Although it was found that the sorption isotherms of different forms of M202 and M206 were similar M202 absorbed and desorbed moisture faster than M206 which might make it more susceptible to fissuring. All obtained moisture sorption isotherms exhibited the sigmoid Type II shape and hysteresis was observed for all forms of rice. Absorption curves obtained using DVS method were compared with the traditional saturated salt solution SSS method. For all forms of rice the maximum difference for equilibrium moisture content value between two methods was observed at 0 and 98 relative humidities which was approximately 8-11 and 7-9. Although at a single relative humidity point equilibrium with DVS was attained much faster than SSS method obtaining a full isotherm with more than 10 data points might make SSS method more feasible for low diffusion materials. Among the select equations to describe sorption behavior of different forms of rice Peleg equation gave the best fit for all forms of rice. 2012.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pneumomediastinum occurs in up to 10 of patients with blunt thoracic and cervical trauma. Mandatory evaluation of all patients with bronchoscopy and esophageal imaging to exclude a major injury has been recommended. There is little data on the safety or efficacy of this approach. We evaluated the incidence of major injuries associated with pneumomediastinum the accuracy of diagnostic modalities and the results of observation versus aggressive evaluation. METHODS Medical records of all blunt trauma patients diagnosed with pneumomediastinum andor aerodigestive tract injury between 1998 and 2005 were reviewed. The patients hospital course was reviewed for demographic data admission diagnoses diagnostic imaging and procedures operations missed injuries length of stay and mortality. RESULTS The review identified a total of 136 patients with pneumomediastinum and an additional 22 patients with thoracic aerodigestive tract injuries but without pneumomediastinum. Only patients with pneumomediastinum were considered in subsequent analysis. Pneumomediastinum was detected by CT scan in all 136 100 patients although identified on plain radiograph in only 20 15 patients. Computed tomography findings were suspicious for a major aerodigestive tract injury in 27 20 patients. Ten 37 of these 27 patients had an injury requiring operative intervention five 4 laryngeal injuries three 2 tracheal disruptions and two 1 esophageal perforations. Eighty-one patients 60 never had endoscopic evaluation. There were no delayed diagnoses missed injuries or complications in the observation-only cohort. The overall sensitivity and specificity of CT scan for major aerodigestive tract injury was 100 and 85 respectively. CONCLUSION Major airway or esophageal injury is an uncommon cause of pneumomediastinum. CT scan was able to identify patients at high risk for aerodigestive injury in all cases and should be the preferred screening tool for airway injury in patients with pneumomediastinum.",

    "abstract": "Universal school meals USM have the potential to increase access to healthy food for millions of U.S. students. This study evaluated school food authorities SFA perspectives of federal USM in response to COVID-19 school year SY 202122 and Californias upcoming USM policy in the SY 202223. In February 2022 all SFAs in California n 1116 were invited to complete an online survey. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression examining differences by school demographic characteristics were used. Five hundred and eighty-one SFAs completed the survey 63 of them first implemented USM during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported benefits included increased student meal participation 79.2 and reduced stigma 39.7. Top challenges included staffing 76.9 and meal packagingsolid waste 67.4. Nearly all SFAs reported pandemic-related challenges procuring the necessary types 88.9 and amounts of foods 85.9 and non-food suppliesequipment 82.6. Over 40 reported that federal reimbursements were insufficient to cover costs. SFAs with 40 FRPM-eligible students andor higher student enrollment reported more current challenges and future concerns than those with 40 FRPMs and lower student enrollment. The top resources requested to implement CAs USM included additional facilitiesequipment 83.8 communicationsmarketing 76.1 increasing meal participation 71.5 and financial management 61.5. Most California SFAs reported that implementing federal USM had the intended effect of feeding more children. This studys findings may be useful to the several other U.S. states implementing universal school meals in the SY 202223 and to other states or countries considering adopting a USM policy in the future.",

In the context of this discussion a novel hetero-nanostructure array based on quantum-confined and visible light-active ironIII oxide nanostructures and their surface modification with tungstenVI oxide is introduced. The heterostructure architecture is designed to combine the functionality of the consituent phases to address the primary requirements for electrodes enabling the efficient generation of hydrogen using solar energy visible light activity chemical stability appropriate bandedge characteristics and potential for low-cost fabrication.

Although both types of liberalization can increase the cost-efficiency of lending in the liberalizing country the distinction arises because opening toward cross-border lending increases competitive pressures contestability in the credit market while takeovers do not.

    "abstract": "The medical community is forced to accelerate the move from opinion-based to evidence-based medicine that is to aim at basing all caring and clinical practice on empiri. A clear-cut epistemology would facilitate this process. In this article we present a comprehensive clinical epidemiological theory which can be used for validity issues in caring science quality of life research controlled clinical trials and compilations of uncontrolled evidence. The theory is based on four distinct stages that can be identified in a study whereof the first is demarcation of the source person-time. A source person-time study base can be identified for any study in all disciplines giving an argument for using this concept as the common reference point for validity issues. Apart from identifying the source person-time recovery of the actually observed person-time collection of data and calculation of an adjusted effect parameter e.g. incidence ratio are additional stages of a study. When the source person-time is demarcated confounding is introduced when the actually observed person-time is recovered misrepresentation in the third stage misclassification and in the fourth analytical alteration of the parameter of effect. The concept of the source person-time can in addition link examination of validity in caring and clinical sciences to observational studies thereby allowing the field to benefit from all theoretical achievements for preventing handling and understanding systematic errors developed in epidemiology. We conclude it is possible to implement a common terminology of validity for all caring and medical sciences. Drawing causal inferences in these disciplines is not mechanical it can never for example be done with statistical inference. Establishing a causal relation always includes an assessment of the magnitude and direction of systematic errors influencing the adjusted effect parameter. From the presented epistemology it follows that differences in validity from a case history to a large randomized placebo-controlled and double-blinded study are quantitative rather than qualitative. This realization in turn opens up for a more refined discussion of when a decision is evidence-based rather than opinion-based.",

    "abstract": "Interactions of drug molecules with lipid membranes play crucial role in their accessibility of cellular targets and can be an important predictor of their therapeutic and safety profiles. Very little is known about spatial localization of various drugs in the lipid bilayers their active form ionization state or translocation rates and therefore potency to bind to different sites in membrane proteins. All-atom molecular simulations may help to map drug partitioning kinetics and thermodynamics thus providing in-depth assessment of drug lipophilicity. As a proof of principle we evaluated extensively lipid membrane partitioning of d-sotalol well-known blocker of a cardiac potassium channel Kv11.1 encoded by the hERG gene with reported substantial proclivity for arrhythmogenesis. We developed the positively charged cationic and neutral d-sotalol models compatible with the biomolecular CHARMM force field and subjected them to all-atom molecular dynamics MD simulations of drug partitioning through hydrated lipid membranes aiming to elucidate thermodynamics and kinetics of their translocation and thus putative propensities for hydrophobic and aqueous hERG access. We found that only a neutral form of d-sotalol accumulates in the membrane interior and can move across the bilayer within millisecond time scale and can be relevant to a lipophilic channel access. The computed water-membrane partitioning coefficient for this form is in good agreement with experiment. There is a large energetic barrier for a cationic form of the drug dominant in water to cross the membrane resulting in slow membrane translocation kinetics. However this form of the drug can be important for an aqueous access pathway through the intracellular gate of hERG. This route will likely occur after a neutral form of a drug crosses the membrane and subsequently re-protonates. Our study serves to demonstrate a first step toward a framework for multi-scale in silico safety pharmacology and identifies some of the challenges that lie therein.",

METHODS We performed a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of children born between 2007 and 2011 who underwent surgery for ARM at 10 childrens hospitals. ARM type was classified based on the location of the distal rectum and all screening studies were reviewed. RESULTS Among 506 patients the most common ARM subtypes were perineal fistula 40.7 no fistula 11.5 and vestibular fistula 10.1. At least 1 screening test was performed in 96.6 of patients and 11.3 of patients underwent all. The proportion of patients with 1 abnormal finding on any screening test varied by type of ARM p0.001. Screening rates varied from 15.2 for limb anomalies to 89.7 for renal anomalies. The most commonly identified anomalies by screening category were spinal tethered cord 20.6 vertebral sacral dysplasiahemisacrum 17.8 cardiac patent foramen ovale 58.0 renal hydronephrosis 22.7 limb absent radius 7.9. CONCLUSION Screening practices and the incidence of associated anomalies varied by type of ARM. The rate of identifying at least one associated anomaly was high across all ARM subtypes. Screening for associated anomalies should be considered standard of care for all ARM patients. TYPE OF STUDY Multi-institutional retrospective cohort study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy. Two recently FDA-approved immunotherapies for B-cell malignancies target CD19 in the form of a Bispecific T-Cell Engager BiTE antibody construct or chimeric antigen receptor T CAR-T cells. Blinatumomab an FDA-approved BiTE binds to CD19 on B cells and to CD3 on T cells mediating effector-target cell contact and T-cell activation that results in effective elimination of target B cells. Although CD19 is expressed by essentially all B-cell malignancies at clinical presentation relapses with loss or reduction in CD19 surface expression are increasingly recognized as a cause of treatment failure. Therefore there is a clear need to develop therapeutics for alternate targets. We have developed a novel BiTE consisting of humanized anti-CD22 and anti-CD3 single chain variable fragments. Target binding of the anti-CD22 and anti-CD3 moieties was confirmed by flow cytometry. CD22-BiTE promoted in vitro cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose and effector target ET-dependent fashion. Additionally in an established acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL xenograft mouse model CD22-BiTE demonstrated tumor growth inhibition comparable to blinatumomab. Further the combination of blinatumomab and CD22-BiTE yielded increased efficacy in vivo when compared to the single agents. In conclusion we report here the development of a new BiTE with cytotoxic activity against CD22 cells which could represent an alternate or complementary therapeutic option for B-cell malignancies.",

Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether athletic performance or some physical fitness measure is affected by prior sexual activity. Web of Science all databases and Google Scholar were used to identify studies from which adult healthy subjects were included. As all studies were crossover trials an inverse variance statistical method with random effects was used to minimize the uncertainty of the pooled effect estimate. Bias was assessed via the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool RoB 2 with a per protocol analysis. Nine crossover studies 133 subjects 99 male were used in this meta-analysis. All those studies did not examine athletic performance per se but all studies assessed one or more physical fitness parameters. The RoB 2 suggested that overall there were some concerns with bias. As there was moderate heterogeneity amongst the different outcomes Tau2 0.02 Chi-square 17.2 df 8 p 0.03 I2 54 a random-effects model was used.

    "abstract": "Studies have examined the prognostic relevance of reproductive factors before breast cancer diagnosis but most have been small and their overall findings inconclusive. Associations between reproductive risk factors and all-cause mortality after breast cancer diagnosis were assessed with the use of a population-based cohort of 3107 women of White European ancestry with invasive breast cancer 1130 from Melbourne and Sydney Australia 1441 from Ontario Canada and 536 from Northern California United States. During follow-up with a median of 8.5 years 567 deaths occurred. At recruitment questionnaire data were collected on oral contraceptive use number of full-term pregnancies age at first full-term pregnancy time from last full-term pregnancy to breast cancer diagnosis breastfeeding age at menarche and menopause and menopausal status at breast cancer diagnosis. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were estimated with the use of Cox proportional hazards models with and without adjustment for age at diagnosis study center education and body mass index. Compared with nulliparous women those who had a child up to 2 years or between 2 and 5 years before their breast cancer diagnosis were more likely to die. The unadjusted hazard ratio estimates were 2.75 95 confidence interval 95 CI 1.98-3.83 P 0.001 and 2.20 95 CI 1.65-2.94 P 0.001 respectively and the adjusted estimates were 2.25 95 CI 1.59-3.18 P 0.001 and 1.82 95 CI 1.35-2.46 P 0.001 respectively. When evaluating the prognosis of women recently diagnosed with breast cancer the time since last full-term pregnancy should be routinely considered along with other established host and tumor prognostic factors but consideration of other reproductive factors may not be warranted.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized clinical trial. ANIMALS Female dogs n30. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 methods for achieving ovarian pedicle hemostasis during LAOVH extracorporeal modified Roeder knot application suture group metal clip application using a multifire 10 mm laparoscopic clip applier clip group or use of a novel 5 mm bipolar vessel-sealing device vessel-sealing group. In all dogs a 3 median portal technique was used. RESULTS Controlling for the dogs bodyweights there was a significant association between surgical time and which method for hemostasis was used. This association was different when comparing the first 5 procedures using each method to the second 5. For a 20 kg dog the surgical time 95 CI for the first 5 procedures was 80 69-91 68 57-79 and 33 21-45 minutes for the suture clip and vessel-sealing groups respectively. For the second 5 procedures surgical time was 71 60-81 50 39-60 and 40 29-51 minutes. Pedicle hemorrhage occurred in all dogs in the clip group 3 dogs in the suture group and none of the dogs in the vessel-sealing group although in all cases was considered hemodynamically inconsequential. All dogs recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSIONS All methods of hemostasis were safe for pedicle sectioning. A learning curve exists for clip and suture methods. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Use of a vessel-sealing device significantly shortens surgical time and provides excellent hemostasis during LAOVH.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the Halorhodospira halophila Hhal photoactive yellow protein PYP is not representative of the greater PYP family. The photodynamics of the PYP isolated from Salinibacter ruber Srub is characterized with a comprehensive range of spectroscopic techniques including ultrafast transient absorption photostationary light titrations Fourier transform infrared and cryokinetics spectroscopies. We demonstrate that the dark-adapted pG state consists of two subpopulations differing in the protonation state of the chromophore and that both are photoactive with the protonated species undergoing excited-state proton transfer. However the primary I0 photoproduct observed in the Hhal PYP photocycle is absent in the Srub PYP photodynamics which indicates that this intermediate while important in Hhal photodynamics is not a critical intermediate in initiating all PYP photocycles. The excited-state lifetime of Srub PYP is the longest of any PYP resolved to date 30 ps which we ascribe to the more constrained chromophore binding pocket of Srub PYP and the absence of the critical Arg52 residue found in Hhal PYP. The final stage of the Srub PYP photocycle involves the slowest known thermal dark reversion of a PYP 40 min vs 350 ms in Hhal PYP. This property allowed the characterization of a pH-dependent equilibrium between the light-adapted pB state with a protonated cis chromophore and a newly resolved pG intermediate with a deprotonated cis chromophore and pG-like protein conformation. This result demonstates that protein conformational changes and chromophore deprotonation precede chromophore reisomerization during the thermal recovery of the PYP photocycle.",

However it is not known which microRNAs are expressed in each of the cell types of the SI epithelium. To bridge this important knowledge gap we performed comprehensive microRNA profiling in all major cell types of the mouse SI epithelium. We used flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting with multiple reporter mouse models to isolate intestinal stem cells enterocytes goblet cells Paneth cells enteroendocrine cells tuft cells and secretory progenitors. We then subjected these cell populations to small RNA-sequencing. The resulting atlas revealed highly enriched microRNA markers for almost every major cell type httpssethupathy-lab.shinyapps.ioSI_miRNA. Several of these lineage-enriched microRNAs LEMs were observed to be embedded in annotated host genes. We used chromatin-run-on sequencing to determine which of these LEMs are likely cotranscribed with their host genes. We then performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to define the cell type specificity of the host genes and embedded LEMs. We observed that the two most enriched microRNAs in secretory progenitors are miR-1224 and miR-672 the latter of which we found is deleted in hominin species. Finally using several in vivo models we established that miR-152 is a Paneth cell-specific microRNA.NEW NOTEWORTHY In this study first microRNA atlas and searchable web server across all major small intestinal epithelial cell types is presented. We have demonstrated microRNAs that uniquely mark several lineages including enteroendocrine and tuft. Identification of a key marker of mouse secretory progenitor cells miR-672 which we show is deleted in humans. We have used several in vivo models to establish miR-152 as a specific marker of Paneth cells which are highly understudied in terms of microRNAs.",

    "abstract": "All features of any data type are universally equipped with categorical nature revealed through histograms. A contingency table framed by two histograms affords directional and mutual associations based on rescaled conditional Shannon entropies for any feature-pair. The heatmap of the mutual association matrix of all features becomes a roadmap showing which features are highly associative with which features. We develop our data analysis paradigm called categorical exploratory data analysis CEDA with this heatmap as a foundation. CEDA is demonstrated to provide new resolutions for two topics multiclass classification MCC with one single categorical response variable and response manifold analytics RMA with multiple response variables. We compute visible and explainable information contents with multiscale and heterogeneous deterministic and stochastic structures in both topics. MCC involves all feature-group specific mixing geometries of labeled high-dimensional point-clouds. Upon each identified feature-group we devise an indirect distance measure a robust label embedding tree LET and a series of tree-based binary competitions to discover and present asymmetric mixing geometries. Then a chain of complementary feature-groups offers a collection of mixing geometric pattern-categories with multiple perspective views. RMA studies a systems regulating principles via multiple dimensional manifolds jointly constituted by targeted multiple response features and selected major covariate features. This manifold is marked with categorical localities reflecting major effects. Diverse minor effects are checked and identified across all localities for heterogeneity. Both MCC and RMA information contents are computed for datas information content with predictive inferences as by-products. We illustrate CEDA developments via Iris data and demonstrate its applications on data taken from the PITCHfx database.",

There is consensus that effective educational approaches need to be combined with a rewarding work environment emphasize a good worklife balance and a focus on achieving meaningful outcomes that center on patients and the public. Still significant barriers limit the numbers of clinicians interested in pursuing careers in primary care including low earning potential heavy medical school debt lack of respect from physician colleagues and enormous burdens of record keeping. To enlarge and energize the pool of primary care trainees we look especially at changes that focus on institutions and the practice environment. Students and residents need training environments where primary care clinicians and interdisciplinary teams play a crucially important role in patient care. For a variety of reasons many academic medical centers cannot easily meet these standards. The authors propose that a major part of primary care education and training be re-located to settings in high-performing health systems built on comprehensive integrated care models where primary care clinicians play a principle role in leadership and care delivery.",

In particular ride-hailing can help improve mobility and accessibility but can also contribute to increases in vehicle-miles traveled congestion and emissions. Induced ride-hailing trips i.e. trips that would not have been made if ride-hailing was not available represent somewhat of a middle ground between benefits and negative externalities. Studies on ride-hailing use have consistently found evidence of induced trips however relatively little is known about induced ride-hailing trips. This study uses data from a weeklong smartphone-based travel survey conducted in three metropolitan regions in California to examine the attributes of induced ride-hailing trips and the people who made said trips during the survey period. Descriptive analysis hypothesis testing and binary logistic regression are applied to gain insights into the attributes of induced ride-hailing trips and the factors influencing whether a person recorded an induced trip during the survey period. The results suggest that induced trips are more likely to correspond to discretionary and maintenance activities and more likely to be made using pooled ride-hailing services. Additionally the members of groups that have traditionally experienced transportation disadvantage including people with disabilities people from lower-income households and people from zero-vehicle households were more likely to record an induced trip. This information can help inform efforts to improve the mobility and accessibility of disadvantaged groups and contribute to improvements in transit and paratransit services.",

Using data at both the professional critic and consumer levels I demonstrate the empirical validity of this principle films targeting more genres attract larger audiences but are less appealing to those audience members. Moreover I find that audiences perceptions of a films fit with targeted genres drive this trade-off as multi-genre films are difficult for audiences to make sense of leading to poor fit with tastes and lowered appeal.

ANIMALS 6 healthy client-owned large- and giant-breed adult dogs. PROCEDURES A topical anesthetic was applied to the nasal passage of each dog and a fiberoptic endoscope was passed transnasally until the tip of the scope was positioned in the oropharynx. All dogs voluntarily drank colored water followed by consumption of a commercial canned diet and then a kibble diet mixed with food color. During each swallow laryngeal and pharyngeal anatomic structures were evaluated and depth of bolus flow prior to the pharyngeal phase of swallowing was assessed. Evidence of bolus retention in the vallecula or pyriform sinuses and laryngeal penetration of the bolus were recorded. RESULTS FEES was completed without major adverse events and was tolerated well by all 6 dogs. Mild self-limiting epistaxis was noted for 2 dogs. The nasopharynx oropharynx and hypopharynx were observed in all dogs movement of food boluses through the esophagus was observed in 2 dogs and food boluses in the stomach were visible in 1 dog. Pharyngeal and laryngeal function was considered physiologically normal in all dogs.

    "abstract": "Pericardial infection is an uncommon clinical entity after traumatic injury. Although invasive intervention is rarely necessary for mild pericardial inflammation pericardial abscess can be life-threatening. The charts of 27 patients with pericarditis requiring management in the intensive care unit andor invasive intervention at Harborview Medical Center during a 10-year period were reviewed. Six cases of trauma-related pericarditis were identified including three cases of pericardial abscess following torso trauma without initial cardiac or pericardial injury. Pericardial abscess following trauma was associated with the sepsis syndrome and multiple system organ failure MSOF in all patients. Computed tomography and pericardiocentesis were useful diagnostic adjuncts. All patients required thoracotomy for pericardial drainage and pericardiectomy. Successful surgical management of pericardial abscess contributed to the resolution of sepsis multiple end-organ dysfunction and ultimately patient survival in all cases. We conclude that pericardial abscess although rare should be considered a potential occult site of sepsis capable of driving MSOF in trauma patients. Expedient diagnosis and surgical drainage are essential for successful patient outcome.",

CLINICAL FINDINGS All patients were male breeds included Pug n 5 Chinese Shar-Pei 1 and Bullmastiff 1. Dyspnea and lethargy were the most common initial complaints with a duration of clinical signs ranging from 1 to 10 days. A CBC showed leukocytosis and neutrophilia in all dogs. Anemia was present in 6 dogs 2 of which received packed RBC transfusions. The diagnosis was made on the basis of results of thoracic radiography CT ultrasonography or a combination of modalities. The left cranial lung lobe was most commonly affected n 4 followed by the right middle lung lobe 2 and the right cranial lung lobe 1. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME A lateral intercostal thoracotomy with lobectomy of the affected lobe was performed in all patients. All dogs survived to be discharged between 1 and 2 days postoperatively. Six of 7 owners contacted for follow-up information 7 to 170 months after discharge reported satisfaction with the treatment and no apparent signs of recurrence of disease. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The juvenile patients of this report were successfully treated surgically with no apparent complications.

Currently there are no unbiased estimates of the number of full-mutation FMR1 alleles in the general population a major obstacle is the lack of an effective screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles in large populations. We have developed a rapid polymerase chain reaction PCR-based screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles. The method utilizes a chimeric PCR primer that targets randomly within the expanded CGG region such that the presence of a broad distribution of PCR products represents a positive result for an expanded allele. The method is applicable for screening both males and females and for allele sizes throughout the premutation 55 to 200 CGG repeats and full-mutation ranges. Furthermore the method is capable of rapid detection of expanded alleles using as little as 1 of the DNA from a single dried blood spot. The methodology presented in this work is suitable for screening large populations of newborn or those at high risk eg autism premature ovarian failure ataxia dementia for expanded FMR1 alleles. The test described herein costs less than 5 per sample for materials with suitable scale-up and automation the cost should approach 1 per sample.",

STUDY DESIGN Open-label multicenter study enrolling heterosexually-active women with previous permanent contraception. Participants underwent a baseline postcoital test cycle with no device to confirm the presence of sperm followed by one diaphragm postcoital test cycle one Ovaprene safety cycle and two Ovaprene postcoital test cycles. In each postcoital test cycle participants underwent a midcycle cervical mucus evaluation to confirm an Insler score 10 and absence of sperm and then returned two to four hours after vaginal intercourse for repeat cervical mucus evaluation. We considered 5 progressively motile spermHPF indicative of preliminary contraceptive effectiveness. RESULTS We enrolled 38 participants 23 completed the study. All participants had 5 progressively motile spermHPF in the baseline cycle and 5 progressively motile spermHPF in all 49 Ovaprene cycles and all 35 diaphragm cycles meeting the definition of a successful postcoital test. This was true regardless of examiner blinding prior vaginal delivery or vaginal ring use body mass index or dislodgements noted by the participant or investigator. The mean of 27.2 17.9 progressively motile spermHPF in baseline postcoital test cycles was reduced to 0.5 1.1 and 0.5 1.3 progressively motile spermHPF in the first and second Ovaprene cycles respectively.

CONCLUSION Use of Ovaprene resulted in meeting the prespecified criterion for contraceptive effect by all participants during all postcoital test cycles. IMPLICATIONS The finding that use of Ovaprene an investigational monthly non-hormonal vaginal contraceptive resulted in postcoital testing of cervical mucus that met the pre-specified definition of success 5 progressively motile spermHPF supports further evaluation of contraceptive efficacy of the device in users at risk for pregnancy.",

CLINICAL FINDINGS Among the 4 cats 3 had neurologic abnormalities including ataxia head pressing disorientation and obtundation. One cat was evaluated because of urethral obstruction a retrieved urethral stone was determined to have urate composition. Clinicopathologic findings hypoproteinemia low BUN concentration and high serum bile acids concentration were consistent with a PSS in all cats. A diagnosis of intrahepatic PSS IHPSS was made for all cats on the basis of ultrasonographic and CT findings. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME All cats underwent percutaneous transvenous coil embolization PTCE. No major intraprocedural complications were encountered and all cats were discharged from the hospital. For the 3 cats that were presented with neurologic signs an evaluation performed at 12 14 or 48 months after the procedure revealed resolution of the neurologic signs and owners reported that the behavior of each cat appeared normal. One cat that initially had neurologic and gastrointestinal signs had lower urinary tract signs after PTCE and developed an acquired extrahepatic PSS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Although IHPSSs in cats are uncommon the outcomes of PTCE for the 4 cats of the present report suggested that this treatment may benefit cats with an IHPSS. No short-term complications were encountered and all cats had improvement in clinical signs following PTCE although an acquired extrahepatic PSS was later identified in 1 cat. Further investigation of the use of endovascular techniques for the treatment of IHPSSs in cats and other species is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Spatially explicit capture-recapture SCR approaches using noninvasive fecal DNA fDNA are applied increasingly to obtain statistically robust abundance estimates for various wildlife species. But SCR has not been widely used for more gregarious species such as elk Cervus canadensis. Because of their heterogeneous use of the landscape and grouping behavior elk present novel challenges to sampling efficiency and statistical assumptions. We employed fDNA SCR and a stratified random sampling approach to estimate abundance in 3 northern California tule elk C. c. nannodes populations concurrent with global positioning system GPS-telemetry monitoring of 66 elk 32 male 34 female in Colusa and Lake counties California USA during JuneAugust 20172019. We collected 1616 fecal pellet groups from the 3 populations resulting in 1002 fDNA genotypes 19 microsatellite loci 1 sex marker of 425 unique individuals. Based on SCR estimates from a model incorporating both sexes elk density ranged from 0.31 95 CI 0.170.55 elkkm2 to 1.7 95 CI 1.32.2 elkkm2 translating approximately to 650 individuals evenly split between sexes among the 3 populations. Independent telemetry data from concurrently tracked individuals indicated that activity centers of females but not males were clustered on the landscape. This finding was corroborated using fDNA to infer activity centers. Comparison of SCR estimates to non-spatial estimates using physically captured individuals suggested that combined-sex SCR models were robust to spatial clustering of females in all 3 populations. Additionally single-sex models were robust to female clustering in the 2 populations with multiple female groups but not in Lake Pillsbury where all females effectively shared a single activity center. In that case the estimate of female abundance was deemed an overestimate. Thus results indicate that SCR was robust to gregariousness in elk in all but the most extreme cases of clustering single-sex female estimation when all individuals share a single activity center and that the inclusion of both sexes was sufficient to offset biases stemming from aggregation of females in all cases. Altogether our findings suggest that SCR methods can be gainfully applied to socially gregarious ungulates such as elk.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The majority of recalls from screening mammography do not result in biopsy recommendation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if calcifications recalled from screening mammography are more likely to result in biopsy recommendations than other findings. METHODS IRB-approved electronic medical record search was performed to obtain a random sample of screening mammograms assigned BI-RADS 0 assessment during 2014-2015. Primary reason for recall was classified as mass asymmetry focal asymmetry calcifications or distortion. Primary outcome was biopsy performed after diagnostic work-up. Secondary outcome was proportion of biopsies performed that were positive for cancer positive predictive value 3 PPV3. Logistic regression was used to compare reasons for recall calcifications vs other findings with biopsy recommendation proportions. RESULTS Random database sampling yielded 402 screening examinations with BI-RADS 0 assessments with 449 total findings. Reasons for recall included calcifications 14.0 63449 masses 15.8 71449 asymmetries 50.8 228449 focal asymmetries 14.3 64449 and architectural distortions 5.1 23449. Overall 21.6 of recalls led to image-guided biopsy 87402. Recalls for calcifications were more likely to result in biopsy compared with other types of findings Adjusted OR 8.56 95 CI 4.58 to 16.0 p 0.001. No statistically significant differences were found in PPV3 proportions between calcification and non-calcification findings p 0.812. CONCLUSION Recalls for calcifications are much more likely to undergo biopsy compared with other findings. Increased biopsy rates for calcifications should be considered when recalling a patient from mammography screening in the context of practice specific positive predictive values and cancer detection rates.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspAbstract 3241jatsp jatspLeukemia cells are believed to arise from leukemia stem cells LSC. It is also known that LSC are responsible for relapse in certain types of leukemia such as acute myeloid leukemia AML. However the existence and role of LSC in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is unclear. CD9 was reported to be a marker for LSC in B-ALL using cell lines Nishida H. et al. 2009. CD9 is a tetraspanin and is believed to be involved in cell adhesion motility and signaling events. It is also involved in metastasis however the mechanisms are unknown. Since childhood ALL is a heterogeneous group of diseases and cell lines can be different from primary leukemia cells we tested the role of CD9 as a candidate LSC marker using primary precursor B preB ALL cells from pediatric patients. Two methods Raman spectroscopy and serial transplantation of sorted leukemia cells in NODSCIDIL2R g null NSG mice were used to confirm LSC. Raman spectroscopy is a laser-based technique for the single cell analysis of intrinsic molecular vibrations reflecting cellular biochemical information. It can provide a quantitative assessment of the levels of DNA RNA proteins lipids and carbohydrates in the cell as well as molecular-level conformational changes. Previous studies by our group showed that unique Raman fingerprints were identified in normal blood cells ALL cells and stem cells including hematopoietic stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Four preB ALL samples were stained for CD9 and sorted by flow cytometry. ALL samples were obtained from patients at diagnosis or freshly harvested from NSG mice engrafted with primary leukemia samples. All samples showed heterogeneous expression of CD9. CD9 high-positive cells and negative cells were flow sorted. Raman spectra of freshly sorted CD9 high-positive and negative cells were obtained. 10 to 20 cells were analyzed in each sample. CD34 positive cells which were isolated from normal donors were also analyzed by Raman spectroscopy as a control. No unique Raman fingerprints were identified to separate CD9 high-positive cells from negative cells using Principal Component Analysis PCA. Furthermore CD9 high-positive and negative cells from three preB ALL samples were transplanted into NSG mice via intra-bone marrow injection. Equal cell numbers 5105 to 1.5106 cells were used for positive and negative samples in each injection. The majority of the mice from both groups transplanted with CD9 high-positive or negative cells developed leukemia 3 to 4 months after injection. Leukemia phenotype was confirmed to be the same as the original leukemia. In conclusion although CD9 was shown to be a marker for LSC in B-ALL cell lines it does not appear to be an LSC marker in primary preB ALL. Since childhood preB ALL is a heterogeneous group of diseases larger cohorts are necessary to confirm our findings. Raman spectroscopy may be a useful screening tool for analysis of cellular intrinsic markers.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To determine the level of epithelial membrane protein-2 EMP2 expression in preretinal membranes from surgical patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy PVR or epiretinal membranes ERMs. EMP2 an integrin regulator is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and understanding EMP2 expression in human retinal disease may help determine whether EMP2 is a potential therapeutic target. METHODS Preretinal membranes were collected during surgical vitrectomies after obtaining consents. The membranes were fixed processed sectioned and protein expression of EMP2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The staining intensity SI and percentage of positive cells PP in membranes were compared by masked observers. Membranes were categorized by their cause and type including inflammatory and traumatic. RESULTS All of the membranes stained positive for EMP2. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy-induced membranes all causes showed greater expression of EMP2 than ERMs with higher SI 1.81 vs. 1.38 P 0.07 and PP 2.08 vs. 1.54 P 0.09. However all the PVR subgroups had similar levels of EMP2 expression without statistically significant differences by Kruskal-Wallis test. Inflammatory PVR had higher expression of EMP2 than ERMs SI of 2.58 vs. 1.38 however this was not statistically significant. No correlation was found between duration of PVR membrane and EMP2 expression. EMP2 was detected by RT-PCR in all samples n 6 tested. CONCLUSIONS All studied ERMs and PVR membranes express EMP2. Levels of EMP2 trended higher in all PVR subgroups than in ERMs especially in inflammatory and traumatic PVR. Future studies are needed to determine the role of EMP2 in the pathogenesis and treatment of various retinal conditions including PVR.",

    "abstract": "Utility All-Terrain Vehicles ATVs are commonly used on farms for agricultural activities such as carrying implements applying fertilizers and transportation. Among all agricultural ATV incidents on farms rollover crushes are the leading cause of fatalities. Crush Protection Devices CPDs are passive safety structures that potentially decrease the severity of injuries and the number of deaths in agricultural ATV rollover incidents. However there are contradictions in the results of previous studies regarding the effectiveness of CPDs in protecting the operator in rollover incidents. The effectiveness of CPDs should be evaluated experimentally with an autonomous ATV allowing repeatable and systematic rollover tests. This study aims at developing three automatic control systems on an ATV for future rollover simulations 1 Global Positioning System GPS- based navigation system that allows autonomous steering 2 remote cruise control module for keeping consistent riding speeds and 3 remote braking system for safety in future unmanned ATV tests.The performance of each system was examined by operating the autonomous ATV in an outdoor testing terrain. The term autonomy in this study refers to the autonomous steering system along with the remotely controlled speed and braking systems. Results showed that the developed systems performed within the acceptable range for conducting future rollover tests accurately and safely. Application of the autonomous ATV expects to deliver repeatable results in rollover simulations and thus increases the reliability of CPD evaluation.",

These patients present unique procedural and patient-specific risks that standard risk models do not fully capture. This study aims to assess risk in infants 2.5 kg undergoing CCC further stratifying by procedural type to better understand predictors of clinically meaningful adverse events CMAE. Patient and Procedural data were collected on diagnostic and interventional catheterization procedures for infants 2.5 kg from the Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes C3PO registry between 2014 and 2022. Cases were stratified into historical 2014-2018 and modern 2019-2022 eras and further categorized into PDA closure and All Other Cases. Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations between covariates and the risk of CMAE. Analysis included 1345 cases. In the modern era PDA closures n 898 66.8 had a lower CMAE rate at 3.6 versus 8.1 for All Other Cases P 0.001. Among All Other Cases n 447 23 were diagnostic and 77 interventional with CMAE rates of 7.7 and 6.4 respectively. CMAE types varied with PDA cases mainly experiencing respiratory events 22 and All Other Cases showing higher rates of access complications 27 and arrhythmias 29. Risk in infants 2.5 kg undergoing CCC is heavily dependent on procedural type and specific patient factors highlighting the need for tailored risk assessment tools.

Negative cross-resistance between azoxystrobin and a carboxamide fungicide boscalid was not observed in AR isolates of B. cinerea. Analysis structure of partial cytochrome b cyt b gene from B. cinerea showed that a 1204-bp intron inserted directly after the codon 143 of cyt b gene was detected from 79 out of 184 isolates and all the isolates having this intron were sensitive to azoxystrobin. This intron was not detected from any AR isolate. Sequence analysis of partial cyt b gene showed that all AR isolates had a point mutation at codon 143 which caused a change of glycine to alanine G143A at this codon position.

    "abstract": "Seven half-day regional listening sessions were held between December 2016 and April 2017 with groups of diverse stakeholders on the issues and potential solutions for herbicideresistance management. The objective of the listening sessions was to connect with stakeholders and hear their challenges and recommendations for addressing herbicide resistance. The coordinating team hired Strategic Conservation Solutions LLC to facilitate all the sessions. They and the coordinating team used in-person meetings teleconferences and email to communicate and coordinate the activities leading up to each regional listening session. The agenda was the same across all sessions and included small-group discussions followed by reporting to the full group for discussion. The planning process was the same across all the sessions although the selection of venue time of day and stakeholder participants differed to accommodate the differences among regions. The listening-session format required a great deal of work and flexibility on the part of the coordinating team and regional coordinators. Overall the participant evaluations from the sessions were positive with participants expressing appreciation that they were asked for their thoughts on the subject of herbicide resistance. This paper details the methods and processes used to conduct these regional listening sessions and provides an assessment of the strengths and limitations of those processes.",

During a median follow-up of 7.8 years 725 deaths occurred. Baseline questionnaires assessed moderate and vigorous recreational physical activity and BMI prior to diagnosis.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The current guidelines recommend weight loss for patients with overweight or obesity and knee or hip osteoarthritis OA however there is a paucity of data on the relation of weight loss to death among patients with OA. We aimed to examine the relation of the rate of weight loss induced by antiobesity medications over one year to all-cause mortality among patients with overweight or obesity and knee or hip OA. METHODS Using the IQVIA Medical Research Database we identified people with overweight or obesity and knee or hip OA. We emulated analyses of a hypothetical target trial to assess the effect of slow-to-moderate 2-10 or fast 10 weight loss induced by the initiation of antiobesity medications within one year on all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes over five years follow-up. RESULTS Among 6524 participants the five-year all-cause mortality rates were 5.3 4.0 and 5.4 for weight gain or stable slow-to-moderate weight loss and fast weight loss arms respectively. Compared with the weight gain or stable arm hazard ratios of all-cause mortality were 0.72 95 confidence interval CI 0.56-0.92 for the slow-to-moderate weight loss arm and 0.99 95 CI 0.67-1.44 for the fast weight loss arm. We found dose-response protective effects of weight loss on incident hypertension type 2 diabetes and venous thromboembolism but a slightly higher risk of cardiovascular disease albeit not statistically significant in the fast rate of weight loss arm than in the weight gain or stable arm and no significant relations of weight loss to the risk of cancer. CONCLUSION In this population-based study a slow-to-moderate but not fast rate of weight loss induced by antiobesity medications is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in people with overweight or obesity and knee or hip OA.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatsp jatspIntroduction We previously demonstrated that receiving all cancer treatment at specialized cancer centers SCCs versus community hospitals through end of therapy is associated with better leukemia-specific survival in children 0-18 years and young adults YA 19-39 years diagnosed with ALL in California. While both age groups benefit from care at a SCC we found only a minority of YAs 36 compared with children 84 received care at a SCC. Our prior findings highlight the need for these patients to be referred to and treated at SCCs but there are potential cost differences associated with this recommendation that have not been previously examined.jatsp jatspMethods Using the California Cancer Registry linked to the Office of Statewide Health and Planning and Development OSHPD statewide hospitalization database we identified children and YAs 19-39 years with first primary ALL who received inpatient treatment from 1995-2014 and had at least 3 years of follow-up. Patients were classified as receiving all or partnone of their treatment at a SCC Childrens Oncology Group or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers for children and National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers for YAs within 3 years of diagnosis to capture the full time of potential primary treatment. Total charges for each admission and hospital level financial information were used to calculate costs adjusted for inflation to 2016 US dollars for each admission excluding peri-partum admissions and those associated with traumatic accidents. One large health maintenance organization system in California did not report charges to OSHPD and was excluded from the analysis 13 of the patient population. In addition patients needed to have at least 80 of charge data to be included in the primary analysis resulting in a study population of 5167 ALL patients. We determined the number of inpatient days and cumulative inpatient costs within 3 years of diagnosis. Mean and median costs overall and per day by age group and location of care were compared using t-tests and Kruskal Wallace tests. We conducted sensitivity analyses 1 limiting our analyses to only patients with all charge data available n5118 and 2 excluding patients with stem cell transplant n693 to determine the impact of these factors on study findings.jatsp jatspResults The mean cost for children receiving all care at SCCs vs non-SCCs was 216439 median121039 vs 191082 median84529 p mean 0.008 p median lt0.001. The cost per day was higher at SCCs mean2840 median2529 than non-SCCs mean2283 median1865 p mean lt 0.001 p median lt 0.001. In children the mean number of inpatient days within 3 years of diagnosis was similar for those who did n70 days and did not 72 days receive all cancer care in SCCs p0.70. Among YAs the mean cost for patients receiving all treatment at SCCs was 380556 median308864 vs 346706 median241847 at non-SCCs p mean0.02 p median lt 0.001. The cost per day was higher at SCCs mean3730 median3537 than non-SCCs mean3224 median2917 p mean lt 0.001 p median lt 0.001. YAs receiving all cancer care at SCCs 99 days had a similar mean number of inpatient days to those receiving care at non-SCCs 101 days p0.97. In the sensitivity analyses excluding patients receiving a transplant the mean cost was lower at both SCCs and non-SCCs but the differences in costs in children and YAs by location of care remained. In addition results were similar when analyses were limited to patients with complete charge data.jatsp jatspConclusion In this large population-based cohort of pediatric and YA patients with ALL we found that inpatient costs and number of inpatient days were higher among YAs than children with ALL. In addition in each age group the costs of inpatient care during the full course of therapy for primary ALL was higher in patients receiving all of their care at SCCs compared patients receiving part or none of their care at an SCC. As inpatient costs do not reflect the total burden associated with cancer care future studies should consider how location of care impacts outpatient emergency department and out-of-pocket costs. Given findings of better outcomes among children and YAs receiving all care at SCCs we believe the marginal increased cost should be considered in view of the better outcomes at SCCs.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Power minimization has become a primary concern in microprocessor design. In recent years many circuit and micro-architectural innovations have been proposed to reduce power in many individual processor units. However many of these prior efforts have concentrated on the approaches which require considerable redesign and verification efforts. Also it has not been investigated whether these techniques can be combined. Therefore a challenge is to find a centralized and simple algorithm which can address power issues for more than one unit and ultimately the entire chip and comes with the least amount of redesign and verification efforts the lowest possible design risk and the least hardware overhead. This paper proposes such a centralized approach that attempts to simultaneously reduce power in processor units with highest dissipation reorder buffer instruction queue loadstore queue and register files. It is based on an observation that utilization for the aforementioned units varies significantly during cache miss period. Therefore we propose to dynamically adjust the size and thus power dissipation of these resources during such periods. Circuit level modifications required for such resource adaptation are presented. Simulation results show a substantial power reduction at the cost of a negligible performance impact and a small hardware overhead. 2011 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "In prior work we assumed that solutes hydrate and that water and the hydrated solutes form an ideal solution. These assumptions led to closed form solutions for both molality and solute activity as a function of water activity. Concentration-activity data of a wide range of solutes were accurately fit by the model. In this work we advance the model by a using statistical mechanics to derive the Gibbs free energy of the solute-water system and b applying the model to data for a number of sugars. The results show that the number of water molecules hydrogen bonded to the sugars is equal to the number of oxygen atoms in the sugar and that one free energy value presumably the net hydrogen bond free energy fits the concentration-activity data pretty well. The model also predicts the number of water molecules bound to the solute and the number of water molecules that are free. Hydration number as a function of water activity from the literature were compared to model predictions finding remarkable agreement.",

Despite improvements over the past decades severe disparities in the availability and access to high-quality health care for children and adolescents continue to exist throughout the United States. Economic and racial factors geographic maldistribution of primary care pediatricians and limited availability of pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists all contribute to inequitable access to pediatric care. Robust comprehensive telehealth coverage is critical to improving pediatric access and quality of care and services particularly for under-resourced populations.",

    "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis is thought to be an adaptation to warm environments involving complex changes in the expression of genes governing photosynthesis intermediary metabolism and leaf anatomy and histology. Such complexity should be difficult to evolve yet the pathway has arisen multiple times in the history of the flowering plants and at least four times in the grass family alone. We have used immunolocalization techniques to compare photosynthetic gene expression across all four origins to determine which genetic changes occur in parallel and which are unique to a particular lineage. The only gene expression patterns common to all origins of the pathway are up regulation of PEP carboxylase and down regulation of RuBisCO in mesophyll cells. Both NAD-malic enzyme and NADP-malic enzyme are expressed in bundle sheaths. Expression patterns of light harvesting chlorophyll alb binding proteins and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase appear to be lineage specific and may be localized to bundle sheaths or to mesophyll or expressed throughout the photosynthetic tissue of the leaf. We suggest that future studies of parallel origin of the C4 pathway concentrate on regulation of the two carboxylases as well as the increased density of vascular tissue which is the only histological characteristic common to all origins of the pathway.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND There has been little improvement in the survival of adolescent and young adult AYA cancer patients aged 15 to 39 years relative to other age groups raising the question of whether such patients receive appropriate initial treatment. METHODS We examined receipt of initial cancer treatment for a population-based sample of 504 AYAs diagnosed in 2007-2008 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphoma germ cell cancer or sarcoma. Registry data patient surveys and detailed medical record reviews were used to evaluate the association of patient demographic socioeconomic and health care setting characteristics with receipt of appropriate initial treatment which was defined by clinical specialists in AYA oncology based on adult guidelines and published literature available before 2009 and analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS Approximately 75 of AYA cancer patients in our sample received appropriate treatment 68 after excluding stage I male germ cell patients who all received appropriate treatment. After this exclusion appropriate treatment ranged from 79 of sarcoma patients to 56 of ALL patients. Cancer type P .01 and clinical trial participation P .04 were statistically significantly associated with appropriate treatment in multivariable analyses. Patients enrolled in clinical trials were more likely to receive appropriate therapy relative to those not enrolled 78 vs 67 adjusted odds ratio 2.6 95 confidence interval 1.1 to 6.4. CONCLUSIONS Except for those with early stage male germ cell tumors approximately 30 or 3 in 10 AYA cancer patients did not receive appropriate therapy. Further investigation is required to understand the reasons for this potential shortfall in care delivery.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recommended systolic blood pressure targets often do not consider the relationship of low diastolic blood pressure DBP levels with cardiovascular disease CVD and all-cause mortality risk which is especially relevant for older people with concurrent comorbidities. We examined the relationship of DBP levels to CVD and all-cause mortality in older women in the Womens Health Initiative Long Life Study WHI-LLS. METHODS The study sample included 7875 women mean age 79 years who underwent a blood pressure measurement at an in-person home visit conducted in 2012-2013. CVD and all-cause mortality were centrally adjudicated. Hazard ratios HRs were obtained from adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS After 5 years follow-up all-cause mortality occurred in 18.4 of women. Compared with a DBP of 80 mm Hg the fully adjusted HR for mortality was 1.33 95 confidence interval CI 1.04-1.71 for a DBP of 50 mm Hg and 1.67 95 CI 1.29-2.16 for a DBP of 100 mm Hg. The HRs for CVD were 1.14 95 CI 0.78-1.67 for a DBP of 50 mm Hg and HR 1.50 95 CI 1.03-2.17 for a DBP of 100 mm Hg. The nadir DBP associated with lowest mortality risk was 72 mm Hg overall. CONCLUSIONS In older women consideration should be given to the potential adverse effects of low and high DBP. Low DBP may serve as a risk marker. DBP target levels between 68 and 75 mm Hg may avoid higher mortality risk.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This study examines clinical functional and CT metrics of sarcopenia and all-cause mortality in older adults undergoing outpatient imaging. METHODS The study included outpatients 65 years of age undergoing CT or PETCT at a tertiary care institution. Assessments included screening questionnaires for sarcopenia SARC-F and frailty FRAIL scale and measurements of grip strength and usual gait speed 6 m course. Skeletal muscle area SMA index SMI areaheight2 and density SMD were measured on CT at T12 and L3. A modified SMI was also examined SMI-m areaheight. Mortality risk was studied with Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS The study included 416 patients mean age 73.8 years sd 6.2 mean follow-up 2.9 years sd 1.34. Abnormal grip SARC-F and FRAIL scale assessments were associated with higher mortality risk HR 95CI 2.0 1.4-2.9 1.6 1.1-2.3 2.0 1.4-2.8. Adjusting for age higher L3-SMA T12-SMA T12-SMI and T12-SMI-m were associated with lower mortality risk HR 95CI 0.80 0.65-0.90 0.76 0.64-0.90 0.84 0.70-1.00 and 0.80 0.67-0.90 respectively. T12-SMD and L3-SMD were not predictive of mortality. After adjusting for abnormal grip strength and FRAIL scale assessments T12-SMA and T12-SMI-m remained predictive of mortality risk HR 95CI 0.83 0.70-1.00 and 0.80 0.67-0.97 respectively. CONCLUSION CT areal metrics were weaker predictors of all-cause mortality than clinical and functional metrics of sarcopenia in our older patient cohort a CT density metric SMD was not predictive. Of areal CT metrics SMI areaheight2 appeared to be less effective than non-normalized SMA or SMA normalized by height1.",

Using a prospective study design we examined the association of caregiving with mortality in a cohort of older women. METHODS Participants were 158987 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years at enrollment into the Womens Health Initiative WHI who provided information on current caregiving status and caregiving frequency at baseline 1993-1998 and follow-up 2004-2005. Mortality was ascertained from baseline through March of 2019. Cox regression with caregiving status defined as a time-varying exposure was used to estimate hazard ratios HR and 95 confidence intervals CI for mortality adjusting for sociodemographic factors smoking and history of diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease CVD and cancer. Stratified analyses explored whether age race-ethnicity depressive symptoms frequency of caregiving optimism and living status modified the association between caregiver status and mortality. RESULTS At baseline 40.7 of women mean age 63.3 years self-identified as caregivers. During a mean 17.5-year follow-up all-cause mortality 50526 deaths was 9 lower multivariable-adjusted HR 0.91 95 CI 0.89-0.93 in caregivers compared to non-caregivers. The inverse association between caregiving and all-cause mortality did not differ according to caregiving frequency or when stratified by age race-ethnicity depressive symptoms optimism or living status interaction p 0.05 all. Caregiving was inversely associated with CVD and cancer mortality. CONCLUSION Among postmenopausal women residing across the United States caregiving was associated with lower mortality. Studies detailing the type and amount of caregiving are needed to further determine its impact on older women.",

Cox proportional hazard models were used for the comparison from which hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals were computed. Within each racialethnic subgroup women with diabetes had an approximately 2-3 times higher risk of all-cause cardiovascular and cancer mortality than did those without diabetes. However the hazard ratios for mortality outcomes were not significantly different between racialethnic subgroups. Population attributable risk percentages PARPs take into account both the prevalence of diabetes and hazard ratios. For all-cause mortality whites had the lowest PARP 11.1 95 confidence interval CI 10.1 12.1 followed by Asians 12.9 95 CI 4.7 20.9 blacks 19.4 95 CI 15.0 23.7 and Hispanics 23.2 95 CI 14.8 31.2. To our knowledge the present study is the first to show that hazard ratios for mortality outcomes were not significantly different between racialethnic subgroups when stratified by diabetes status. Because of the amplifying effect of diabetes prevalence efforts to reduce racialethnic disparities in the rate of death from diabetes should focus on prevention of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Different approaches have investigated the effects of different extracellular matrices ECMs and three-dimensional 3D culture on islet function showing encouraging results. Ideally the proper scaffold should mimic the biochemical composition of the native tissue as it drives numerous signaling pathways involved in tissue homeostasis and functionality. Tissue-derived decellularized biomaterials can preserve the ECM composition of the native tissue making it an ideal scaffold for 3D tissue engineering applications. However the decellularization process may affect the retention of specific components and the choice of a proper detergent is fundamental in preserving the native ECM composition. In this study we evaluated the effect of different decellularization protocols on the mechanical properties and biochemical composition of pancreatic ECM pECM hydrogels. Fresh porcine pancreas tissue was harvested cut into small pieces rinsed in water and treated with two different detergents sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS or Triton X-100 for 1 day followed by 3 days in water. Effective decellularization was confirmed by PicoGreen assay Hoescht and HE staining showing no differences among groups. Use of a protease inhibitor PI was also evaluated. Effective decellularization was confirmed by PicoGreen assay and hematoxylin and eosin HE staining showing no differences among groups. Triton-treated samples were able to form a firm hydrogel under appropriate conditions while the use of SDS had detrimental effects on the gelation properties of the hydrogels. ECM biochemical composition was characterized both in the fresh porcine pancreas and all decellularized pECM hydrogels by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. Fibrillar collagen was the major ECM component in all groups with all generated hydrogels having a higher amount compared with fresh pancreas. This effect was more pronounced in the SDS-treated hydrogels when compared with the Triton groups showing very little retention of other ECM molecules. Conversely basement membrane and matricellular proteins were better retained when the tissue was pretreated with a PI and decellularized in Triton X-100 making the hydrogel more similar to the native tissue. In conclusion we showed that all the protocols evaluated in the study showed effective tissue decellularization but only when the tissue was pretreated with a PI and decellularized in Triton detergent the biochemical composition of the hydrogel was closer to the native tissue ECM. Impact Statement The article compares different methodologies for the generation of a pancreas-derived hydrogel for tissue engineering applications. The biochemical characterization of the newly generated hydrogel shows that the material retains all the extracellular molecules of the native tissue and is capable of sustaining functionality of the encapsulated beta-cells.",

    "abstract": "Social network analysis SNA is a powerful quantitative tool to measure animals direct and indirect social connectedness in the context of social groups. However the extent to which behavioural sampling methods influence SNA metrics remains unclear. To fill this gap here we compare network indices of grooming huddling and aggression calculated from data collected from three macaque species through two sampling methods focal animal sampling FAS and all-occurrences behaviour sampling ABS. We found that measures of direct connectedness degree centrality and network density were correlated between FAS and ABS for all social behaviours. Eigenvector and betweenness centralities were correlated for grooming and aggression networks across all species. By contrast for huddling we found a correlation only for betweenness centrality while eigenvector centralities were correlated only for the tolerant bonnet macaque but not so for the despotic rhesus macaque. Grooming and huddling network modularity and centralization were correlated between FAS and ABS for all but three of the eight groups. By contrast for aggression network we found a correlation for network centralization but not modularity between the sampling methodologies. We discuss how our findings provide researchers with new guidelines regarding choosing the appropriate sampling method to estimate social network metrics.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma incidence has been increasing in light-skinned populations worldwide but the reasons for the increase have been controversial. Our prior assessment in California non-Hispanic whites showed substantial increases in invasive melanoma incidence for tumors of all thicknesses in all neighborhoods categorized by socioeconomic status SES between 1988-1992 and 1998-2002. To understand whether these trends continued we updated our assessment to include the diagnosis period 2008-2012 and more accurate pathologic stage at diagnosis. We used the California Cancer Registry to calculate age-adjusted incidence rates for over 58000 newly diagnosed melanomas. Incidence rates not only continued to rise over the 10-year period from 1998-2002 and 2008-2012 but also showed significant increases in almost all groups defined jointly by tumor thickness or stage at diagnosis and a small area census tract SES measure. The largest relative rate increases were seen for regional distant and ulcerated disease especially among males living in the lowest SES neighborhoods. Considering tumor thickness and stage as proxies for time to screening detection and neighborhood SES as a proxy for health care access we interpret this pattern to indicate continued true increases in melanoma occurrence as opposed to a thin tumor phenomenon simply driven by improved access to care.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to establish whether or not bicycle commuting and cycling for other purposes e.g. shopping visiting friends are related over time. Using previously gathered panel data the Dutch mobility panel these relationships are revealed by 1 a series of conditional change models and 2 a latent transition model. The conditional change models indicate that with a lag of 1 year and controlling for a range of background characteristics bicycle commuting and non-work cycling in number of weekly trips have a positive reciprocal influence on each other. The models show that work-related factors such as the distance to work or whether a person receives a travel allowance affect not only bicycle commuting but also non-work cycling. The latent transition model indicates that people can be clustered into four groups non-cyclists non-work cyclists all-around cyclists and commuter cyclists. This model shows that people with a consistent propensity to not cycle at all non-cyclists or to cycle for both work and non-work purposes all-around cyclists are most stable in their travel behavior. Non-work cyclists and commuter cyclists are less stable in travel behavior. The model also shows that all-around cyclists are not significantly affected by a change in the distance to work. The article concludes with several directions for future research. 2013 Springer ScienceBusiness Media New York.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy DMD is an X-linked muscle disorder caused by a mutation or deletion in the dystrophin gene. In boys with DMD muscle weakness progresses in a proximal to distal pattern leading to gait abnormalities at all joints in all planes of motion. Longitudinal studies are imperative to quantify changes in gait function due to DMD and are of particular importance when examining the efficacy of treatment interventions. RESEARCH QUESTION The purpose of this study was to examine the sensitivity of the Gait Deviation Index GDI and Movement Analysis Profile Gait Profile Score GPS and Gait Variable Score GVS to quantify the longitudinal ambulatory decline in boys with DMD. A secondary aim was to quantify the effect of corticosteroid CS treatment. METHODS The gait patterns of 75 boys were assessed longitudinally 11 were steroid nave SN and 64 received CS treatment. Joint kinematics were collected using either a VICON 612 or a Motion Analysis Corporation 3-D system. Representative trials were used to compute the GDI GPS and the nine GVS for each boy for each visit. RESULTS At baseline GVS for the boys with DMD revealed abnormalities in all lower extremity joints and in all planes of movement compared to TD peers. GDI and GPS indices verified that the overall quality of gait in boys with DMD decreases at a significant rate with age. Boys who were steroid nave changed at a rate 3 times greater than boys on CS in coronal plane hip motion. SIGNIFICANCE The gait indices of GDI and GPS are able to identify changes in the quality of gait patterns in boys with DMD. Although boys on steroids had greater gait deviations than boys who were SN at baseline the rate of decline in gait quality was slower in boys on CS.",

The current study analyzed grapes primary and secondary metabolism across grapevine genotypes and seasons to reveal both conserved and variable impacts to GRBV infection. Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon CS grapevines grafted on two different rootstocks 110R and 420A were analyzed in 2016 and 2017. Metabolite profiling revealed a considerable impact on amino acid and malate acid levels volatile aroma compounds derived from the lipoxygenase pathway and anthocyanins synthesized in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Conserved transcriptional responses to GRBV showed induction of auxin-mediated pathways and photosynthesis with inhibition of transcription and translation processes mainly at harvest. There was an induction of plant-pathogen interactions at pre-veraison for all genotypes and seasons except for CS 110R in 2017. Lastly differential co-expression analysis revealed a transcriptional shift from metabolic synthesis and energy metabolism to transcription and translation processes associated with a virus-induced gene silencing transcript. This plant-derived defense response transcript was only significantly upregulated at veraison for all genotypes and seasons suggesting a phenological association with disease expression and plant immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Leukemia is broadly divided into acute and chronic lymphocytic and myeloid types based on the proportion of blasts morphology of cells and expression of specific antigens on neoplastic cells. Classifying leukemia in horses can be challenging if blasts predominate and since few antibodies to identify cell types are available. The objective of this study was to describe in detail the clinical and pathologic features of acute leukemia in horses. Twelve horses ranging from 0.2 to 25.9 years of age were diagnosed with acute leukemia. Six cases were classified as acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL based on predominance of blasts lack of granulocytic or monocytic differentiation and detection of CD3 CD20 andor CD79a antigens by immunohistochemistry. Six other cases were classified as acute myeloid leukemia AML with myelomonocytic n 4 basophilic n 1 and eosinophilic n 1 differentiation based on 20 bone marrow blasts and partial leukocytic differentiation. Reactivity with antibodies to Iba-1AIF-1 CD172a and CD163 was determined for all cases of AML. Eleven horses had thrombocytopenia 10 had neutropenia 8 had anemia all had blasts on blood films and none had leukocytosis. Ten horses had increased serum acute phase proteins. Bone marrow cellularity ranged from 30 to 100 and the proportion of blasts ranged from 80 to 100 and 30 to 60 in ALL and AML respectively. Horses were severely ill at diagnosis and euthanized within days or weeks. Unique features of acute leukemia in horses compared to other species were variable lymphocyte antigen expression ALL and frequent inflammation ALL and AML.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Hospital transfers from VA Community Living Centers CLCs are common. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of introducing the Intervention to Reduce Acute Care Transfers INTERACT program into VA CLCs. METHODS Cluster randomized trial involving 16 pair-matched VA CLCs. INTERVENTIONS Intervention CLC nursing staff were trained in the use of INTERACT tools designed to identify early signs of a clinical change in condition and improve communication and documentation. One tool was embedded into the VA Electronic Medical Record. Intervention staff were supported by bi-weekly calls over 18 months to reinforce INTERACT tool use. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome for intent-to-treat analyses was the rate of all-cause hospitalizations per 1000 person days. Secondary outcomes assessed through structured record reviews and algorithms were intervention CLCs change in 1 potentially inappropriate transfer decisions and 2 potentially preventable transfers. CLC staff implementation and engagement in INTERACT were documented. RESULTS Only five of the eight intervention CLCs substantially engaged in the intervention. Using a negative-binomial regression with random effects adjusting for month intervention and the interaction of time and the intervention we observed no statistically significant difference between intervention and control facilities in all-cause hospitalizations. This was confirmed with matched resident-level as-treated analyses among residents in the five engaged CLCs and their matched controls. Structured implicit review of intervention CLCs medical records revealed low rates of inappropriate transfer decisions both before and after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS Introducing INTERACT into volunteer VA CLCs did not reduce the rates of all-cause hospitalizations. In both the pre- and post-intervention periods all-cause hospitalization rates were relatively higher and inappropriate transfers lower in VA CLCs than commonly observed in community NHs. Low rates of potentially inappropriate transfers and higher nurse and physician staffing in CLCs may explain why INTERACT was not implemented as fully as planned.",

All patients underwent patch angioplasty of the proximal anomalous coronary artery with glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium. When the coronary artery coursed between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery the main pulmonary artery was translocated toward the left pulmonary artery to create additional space and prevent compression.

Using a database of 7088 bicycle crashes over a three-year period in the San Francisco Bay Area this study examines the influence of socioeconomic transportation and land-use characteristics as potential causes of differences in bicycle crash occurrences among racial and ethnic groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. While areas of high poverty and high land-use intensity are associated with higher numbers of bicycle crashes overall lower-traffic streets and bicycle infrastructure do not affect the frequency of crashes involving Black and Hispanic cyclists. Black bicyclists have a disproportionate risk of being involved in a crash in poor urban neighborhoods controlling for other factors. These findings draw attention to the need for planners to consider how socioeconomic differences and vulnerability at the neighborhood level play a role in safety.",

    "abstract": "Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus TSWV causes substantial economic loss to tomato production and the Sw-5b resistance gene is widely deployed for management. Here we show i the emergence of resistance-breaking RB TSWV strains in processing and fresh market tomato production in California over the past ten years and ii evolutionary relationships with RB strains from other areas. A specific RT-PCR test was used to show the C118Y RB strain that emerged in Fresno County in 2016 quickly became predominant in the central production area and remained so through this study. In 2021 the C118Y strain was detected in the Northern production area and was predominant in 2022. However in 2023 the C118Y strain was unexpectedly detected in fewer spotted wilt samples from resistant varieties. This was due to emergence of the T120N RB strain previously known to occur in Spain. A specific RT-PCR test was developed and used to show that the T120N RB strain was predominant in Colusa and Sutter counties detected in 75-80 of samples and detected in 50 of samples from Yolo County. Pathogenicity tests confirmed California isolates of the T120N strain infected Sw-5b tomato varieties and induced severe symptoms. Another RB strain C118F was associated with spotted wilt samples of Sw-5 varieties from fresh market tomato production in southern California. Phylogenetic analyses with complete NSm sequences revealed that the C118Y and T120N RB strains infecting resistant processing tomato in California emerged locally whereas those from fresh market production were more closely related to isolates from Mexico. Thus widespread deployment of this single dominant resistance gene in California has driven the local emergence of multiple RB strains in different tomato production areas and types. These results further emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring for RB strains and identification of sources of resistance to these strains.",

OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that low fasting glucose would be associated with cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality in postmenopausal women. METHODS To test our hypothesis we used both continuous incidence rates and Cox proportional hazards models in 17287 participants from the Womens Health Initiative with fasting glucose measured at baseline. Participants were separated into groups based on fasting glucose level low 80mgdL normalreference 80-99mgdL impaired 100-125mgdL and diabetic 126mgdL. RESULTS Participants were free of cardiovascular disease at enrollment had mean age of 62years and were 52 Caucasian 24 African American 8 Asian and 12 Hispanic. Median follow-up was 15years. Graphs of continuous incidence rates compared to fasting glucose distribution exhibited evidence of a weak J-shaped association with heart failure and mortality that was predominantly due to participants with treated diabetes. Impaired and diabetic fasting glucose were positively associated with all outcomes. Associations for low fasting glucose differed with coronary heart disease HR0.64 0.42 0.98 significantly inverse stroke 0.73 0.48 1.13 combined cardiovascular disease 0.91 0.73 1.14 and all-cause mortality 0.97 0.79 1.20 null or inverse and not significant and heart failure 1.27 0.80 2.02 positive and not significant.

    "abstract": "The prosocial hormone oxytocin OXT has become a new target for research on the etiology and treatment of autism spectrum disorder ASD a condition characterized by deficits in social function. However it remains unknown whether there are alterations in OXT receptor OXTR levels in the ASD brain. This study quantified the density of OXTR and of the structurally related vasopressin 1a receptor AVPR1a in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with ASD and typically developing individuals. We analyzed two regions known to contain OXTR across all primates studied to date the nucleus basalis of Meynert NBM which mediates visual attention and the superior colliculus which controls gaze direction. In the NBM specimens we also analyzed the neighboring ventral pallidum VP and the external segment of the globus pallidus. In the superior colliculus specimens we also analyzed the adjacent periaqueductal gray. We detected dense OXTR binding in the human NBM and VP and moderate to low OXTR binding in the human globus pallidus superior colliculus and periaqueductal gray. AVPR1a binding was negligible across all five regions in all specimens. Compared to controls ASD specimens exhibited significantly higher OXTR binding in the NBM and significantly lower OXTR binding in the VP an area in the mesolimbic reward pathway. There was no effect of ASD on OXTR binding in the globus pallidus superior colliculus or periaqueductal gray. We also found a significant negative correlation between age and OXTR binding in the VP across all specimens. Further analysis revealed a peak in OXTR binding in the VP in early childhood of typically developing individuals which was absent in ASD. This pattern suggests a possible early life critical period which is lacking in ASD where this important reward area becomes maximally sensitive to OXT binding. These results provide unique neurobiological insight into human social development and the social symptoms of ASD.",

    "abstract": "Introduction While the health benefits of cycling and walking have been well established questions remain about whether these benefits hold in varying socioeconomic contexts including across demographic groups and in the context of neighborhood change. This study examines this relationship identifying associations between cycling or walking and self-reported health whether socioeconomic status moderates these associations and whether gentrification influences the potential moderating effects. Methods This study uses the 2017 US National Household Travel Survey subset to adults who lived in central cities n 91541. Weighted logistic regression models with interaction terms were fit to estimate self-reported health status separately for cycling and walking. Gentrification was measured using an indicator based on previous research using US Census data. Results Cycling in the previous week and each additional walking trip were associated with higher odds of reporting better health. Socioeconomic status moderated the positive associations between active transportation and health for a few variables. Cyclists of color had smaller health effects from cycling for utilitarian trips while race and ethnicity had only a marginal moderating effect on the association between walking and health. Gentrification was an insignificant moderating factor in general. Conclusions Findings suggest planning efforts that continue to support programs that promote cycling and walking are crucial tools in the public health toolbox. The health gains from active transportation might be experienced in a variety of neighborhood contexts. Nevertheless infrastructure investments and policy must be attentive to inequities across neighborhoods.",

This study examines the reliability and validity of different FTR measures currently in use. RESEARCH DESIGN We studied 3 definitions 1 original FTR using all deaths 2 FTR-N a nursing sensitive definition that uses only specific complications and deaths and 3 FTR-A another restricted definition of FTR used by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ for analyzing Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project HCUP data. Each FTR measure was applied to 403679 general surgical patients across 1567 hospitals reported in 1999-2000 Medicare MEDPAR data. RESULTS Although FTR used all deaths FTR-N and FTR-A definitions omitted 49 and 42 of deaths respectively. Reliability was better for FTR than FTR-A or FTR-N rho 0.32 vs. 0.18 vs. 0.18 respectively. VALIDITY Hospitals ranked by adjusted mortality were highly correlated with FTR Kendalls tau 0.83 and less correlated with FTR-A tau 0.43 and FTR-N tau 0.41. Adjusting for patient characteristics all FTR measures showed strong associations with bed-to-nurse ratio nursing mix teaching status and hospital size however hospital high technology was not as well associated with FTR-N. CONCLUSIONS For general surgery more limited definitions used by FTR-N and FTR-A omit over 40 of deaths display less reliability and may have more questionable validity than the original FTR measure. We encourage analysts to use the original FTR definition that uses all deaths when analyzing hospital quality of care.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Blood typing before transfusion minimizes the risk of transfusion reactions and prevents immunization of the recipient against incompatible RBC antigens. The major RBC antigens that warrant identification before packed RBC or whole blood transfusions in horses are Ca and Aa. Standard blood-typing protocols are time-consuming 2.5-3.0 hours and impractical in emergency settings. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine whether equine RBCs could be typed for Ca and Aa antigens using sera from horses with RBC antibodies in a modified rapid 15 minute blood-typing protocol. METHODS Serum was obtained from a horse with anti-Ca antibodies and from another horse with anti-Aa antibodies. The presence of agglutinating antibodies was confirmed with antibody screening. Venous blood samples collected in citrate-phosphate-dextrose were obtained from 21 horses of various breeds. Samples were blood typed in the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital Hematology Laboratory using standard methodology. Washed RBCs from each of the 21 horses were incubated individually with anti-Ca and anti-Aa sera at dilutions of 14 18 and 116 for 15 and 30 minutes at room temperature and 37 degrees C. RESULTS Of the 21 horses 13 were identified as AaCa four were AaCa- two were Aa-Ca and two were Aa-Ca-. All 17 Aa-positive horses had a positive agglutination reaction at all dilutions of anti-Aa serum incubation times and temperatures while all Aa-negative horses were negative. Each Ca-positive horse had a positive agglutination reaction at all incubation time points and temperatures up to the 116 dilution of the anti-Ca serum. All Ca-negative horses were negative at all times temperatures and dilutions of anti-Ca serum. Use of the modified protocol on 26 hospitalized horses resulted in accurate typing based on complete antibody screens. CONCLUSIONS These results support the hypothesis that equine RBCs can be blood typed using a rapid 15 minute protocol at room temperature for the presence of Ca and Aa antigens using equine-derived antisera. This technique may be beneficial for pretransfusion testing of equine patients in an emergency setting.",

    "abstract": "Oceanic and coastal waters are acidifying due to processes dominated in the open ocean by increasing atmospheric CO2 and dominated in estuaries and some coastal waters by nutrient-fueled respiration. The patterns and severity of acidification as well as its effects are modified by the host of stressors related to human activities that also influence these habitats. Temperature deoxygenation and changes in food webs are particularly important co-stressors because they are pervasive and both their causes and effects are often mechanistically linked to acidification. Development of a theoretical underpinning to multiple stressor research that considers physiological ecological and evolutionary perspectives is needed because testing all combinations of stressors and stressor intensities experimentally is impossible. Nevertheless use of a wide variety of research approaches is a logical and promising strategy for improving understanding of acidification and its effects. Future research that focuses on spatial and temporal patterns of stressor interactions and on identifying mechanisms by which multiple stressors affect individuals populations and ecosystems is critical. It is also necessary to incorporate consideration of multiple stressors into management mitigation and adaptation to acidification and to increase public and policy recognition of the importance of addressing acidification in the context of the suite of other stressors with which it potentially interacts.",

ANIMALS 12 healthy adult German Shepherd Dogs and data previously collected from 16 healthy adult Labrador Retrievers. PROCEDURES German Shepherd Dogs were sedated. One investigator then measured motion of the carpal cubital elbow shoulder tarsal stifle and hip joints of the sedated dogs. Measurements were made in triplicate with a UG and an EG. Radiographs were taken of all joints in maximal flexion and extension. Values were compared between the UG and EG and with values previously determined for joints of 16 Labrador Retrievers. RESULTS An EG had higher variability than a UG for all dogs. The EG variability appeared to result from the technique for the EG. German Shepherd Dogs had lower values in flexion and extension than did Labrador Retrievers for all joints except the carpal joints. German Shepherd Dogs had less motion in the tarsal joints compared with motion for the Labrador Retrievers but had similar motion in all other joints. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A UG is reliable for obtaining measurements in German Shepherd Dogs. There was higher variability for the EG than for the UG and an EG cannot be recommended for use.",

    "abstract": "The role of factors such as frequency contraction duration and active time in the adaptation to chronic low-frequency electrical stimulation CLFS is widely disputed. In this study we explore the ability of contraction duration 0.6 6 60 and 600 sec to induce a fast-to-slow shift in engineered muscle while using a stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and keeping active time constant at 60. We found that all contraction durations induced similar slowing of time-to-peak tension. Despite similar increases in total myosin heavy MHC levels with stimulation increasing contraction duration resulted in progressive decreases in total fast myosin. With contraction durations of 60 and 600 sec MHC IIx levels decreased and MHC IIa levels increased. All contraction durations resulted in fast-to-slow shifts in TnT and TnC but increased both fast and slow TnI levels. Half-relaxation slowed to a greater extent with contraction durations of 60 and 600 sec despite similar changes in the calcium sequestering proteins calsequestrin and parvalbumin and the calcium uptake protein SERCA. All CLFS groups resulted in greater fatigue resistance than control. Similar increases in GLUT4 mitochondrial enzymes SDH and ATPsynthase the fatty acid transporter CPT-1 and the metabolic regulators PGC-1 and MEF2 were found with all contraction durations. However the mitochondrial enzymes cytochrome C and citrate synthase were increased to greater levels with contraction durations of 60 and 600 sec. These results demonstrate that contraction duration plays a pivotal role in dictating the level of CLFS-induced contractile and metabolic adaptations in tissue-engineered skeletal muscle.",

We describe four different rearrangements of the erythropoietin receptor gene EPOR in Philadelphia chromosome-like Ph-like ALL. All of these rearrangements result in truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of EPOR at residues similar to those mutated in primary familial congenital polycythemia with preservation of the proximal tyrosine essential for receptor activation and loss of distal regulatory residues. This resulted in deregulated EPOR expression hypersensitivity to erythropoietin stimulation and heightened JAK-STAT activation. Expression of truncated EPOR in mouse B cell progenitors induced ALL in vivo. Human leukemic cells with EPOR rearrangements were sensitive to JAK-STAT inhibition suggesting a therapeutic option in high-risk ALL.",

    "abstract": "Reaching the native states of small proteins a necessary step towards a comprehensive understanding of the folding mechanisms has remained a tremendous challenge to ab initio protein folding simulations despite the extensive effort. In this work the folding process of the B domain of protein A BdpA has been simulated by both conventional and replica exchange molecular dynamics using AMBER FF03 all-atom force field. Started from an extended chain a total of 40 conventional each to 1.0 micros and two sets of replica exchange each to 200.0 ns per replica molecular dynamics simulations were performed with different generalized-Born solvation models and temperature control schemes. The improvements in both the force field and solvent model allowed successful simulations of the folding process to the native state as demonstrated by the 0.80 A Calpha root mean square deviation RMSD of the best folded structure. The most populated conformation was the native folded structure with a high population. This was a significant improvement over the 2.8 A Calpha RMSD of the best nativelike structures from previous ab initio folding studies on BdpA. To the best of our knowledge our results demonstrate for the first time that ab initio simulations can reach the native state of BdpA. Consistent with experimental observations including Phi-value analyses formation of helix IIIII hairpin was a crucial step that provides a template upon which helix I could form and the folding process could complete. Early formation of helix III was observed which is consistent with the experimental results of higher residual helical content of isolated helix III among the three helices. The calculated temperature-dependent profile and the melting temperature were in close agreement with the experimental results. The simulations further revealed that phenylalanine 31 may play critical to achieve the correct packing of the three helices which is consistent with the experimental observation. In addition to the mechanistic studies an ab initio structure prediction was also conducted based on both the physical energy and a statistical potential. Based on the lowest physical energy the predicted structure was 2.0 A Calpha RMSD away from the experimentally determined structure.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to determine the differences in growth rate of adrenal adenomas and malignant adrenal nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This was a retrospective review of adults with an adrenal nodule seen at two different abdominal or chest CT examinations or PETCT examinations. Patients in the adenoma group were included if they had a CT MRI or pathologic diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. Patients in the malignant group were included if they had a pathologically proven malignant adrenal nodule. Nodule growth was defined as a change in the largest axial diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm. Growth rate was calculated by dividing the change in the longest axial diameter by the time between the first and last imaging examination. RESULTS. There were 105 adenomas and 26 malignant nodules. Of the 105 adenomas 34 32.4 95 CI 23.6-42.2 grew three 2.9 95 CI 0.6-8.1 became smaller and 68 64.8 95 CI 54.8-73.8 were unchanged in size. All 26 100 95 CI 89.1-100 malignant nodules grew. The mean SD growth rate of adenomas was 1.0 0.67 mmyear range 0.3-2.8 mmyear compared with 58.4 78.5 mmyear range 5.8-395.4 mmyear for malignant nodules p 0.001. A growth rate of 3 mmyear distinguished adenomas from malignant nodules with a sensitivity of 100 95 CI 86.8-100 and a specificity of 100 95 CI 96.6-100. CONCLUSION. Approximately one-third of radiologically proven adrenal adenomas grew all of which grew at a rate less than 3 mmyear. All malignant adrenal nodules grew and all at a rate greater than 5 mmyear.",

    "abstract": "There has been resistance to COVID-19 public health restrictions partly due to changes and reductions in work resulting in financial stress. Psychological reactance theory posits that such restrictions to personal freedoms result in anger defiance and motivation to restore freedom. In an online study N 301 we manipulated the target of COVID-19 restrictions as impacting self or community. We hypothesized that a greater pandemic-related financial stress would predict greater reactance b the self-focused restriction condition would elicit greater reactance than the community-focused restriction condition c reactance would be greatest for financially-stressed individuals in the self-focused condition and d greater reactance would predict lower adherence to social distancing guidelines. Independent of political orientation and sense of community greater financial stress predicted greater reactance only in the self-focused condition the community-focused condition attenuated this association. Additionally greater reactance was associated with lower social distancing behavior. These findings suggest that economic hardship exacerbates negative responses to continued personal freedom loss. Community-focused COVID-19 health messaging may be better received during continued pandemic conditions.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE While the true incidence of secondary hypospadias repair is unknown the current literature cites a 3.3 to 6.7 reoperation rate after distal hypospadias repair and an association with age. We hypothesized that secondary surgery rates are associated with patient factors and have been underreported due to limited followup. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used an academic practice plan consortium database to identify a population that underwent primary hypospadias repair in 2009 and 2010. Secondary surgeries between 2009 and 2019 were captured. The association of variables such as age insurance type region surgeon volume and surgeon years in practice with all-inclusive and specific secondary surgery procedures were analyzed using mixed effects multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS We identified 5178 boys who had primary hypospadias repair performed by 84 pediatric urologists at 46 hospitals in 2009 and 2010. During the ensuing 9 to 10 years distal proximal and perineal hypospadias repair had a 12.6 37.9 and 46.6 rate of secondary surgery respectively. After adjusting for all other variables in the model patients with noncommercial insurance had a 26 OR 1.26 p0.04 increased odds of secondary surgery. Patient age and surgeon years in practice were not associated with all-inclusive secondary surgery except for endoscopic treatment. Surgeon volume was not associated with secondary surgery. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that secondary surgery rates are underreported if followup is limited to less than 6 years. Patient age surgeon volume and experience did not associate with all-inclusive reoperation rates whereas insurance status was a major predictor of reoperation.",

    "abstract": "People must constantly select among potential thoughts and actions in the face of competition from a multiple task-relevant options underdetermined competition and b strongly dominant options that are not appropriate in the current context prepotent competition. These types of competition are ubiquitous during language production. In this work we investigate the neural mechanisms that allow individuals to effectively manage these cognitive control demands and to quickly choose words with few errors. Using fMRI we directly contrast underdetermined and prepotent competition within the same task verb generation for the first time allowing localization of the neural substrates supporting the resolution of these two types of competition. Using a neural network model we investigate the possible mechanisms by which these brain regions support selection. Together our findings demonstrate that all competition is not alike resolving prepotent competition and resolving underdetermined competition rely on partly dissociable neural substrates and mechanisms. Specifically activation of left ventrolateral pFC is specific to resolving underdetermined competition between multiple appropriate responses most likely via competitive lateral inhibition. In contrast activation of left dorsolateral pFC is sensitive to both underdetermined competition and prepotent competition from response options that are inappropriate in the current context. This region likely provides top-down support for task-relevant responses which enables them to out-compete prepotent responses in the selection process that occurs in left ventrolateral pFC.",

    "abstract": "The exponential rise in molecular and genomic data has generated a vast array of therapeutic targets. Oligonucleotide-based technologies to down regulate these molecular targets have promising therapeutic efficacy. However there is relatively limited success in translating this into effective in vivo cancer therapeutics. The primary challenge is the lack of effective cancer cell-targeted delivery methods particularly for a systemic disease such as leukemia. We developed a novel leukemia-targeting compound composed of a monoclonal antibody directly conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide ASO. Our compound uses an ASO that specifically targets the transcription factor MAX dimerization protein 3 MXD3 which was previously identified to be critical for precursor B cell preB acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL cell survival. The MXD3 ASO was conjugated to an anti-CD22 antibody CD22 Ab that specifically targets most preB ALL. We demonstrated that the CD22 Ab-ASO conjugate treatment showed MXD3 protein knockdown and leukemia cell apoptosis in vitro. We also demonstrated that the conjugate treatment showed cytotoxicity in normal B cells but not in other hematopoietic cells including hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore the conjugate treatment at the lowest dose tested 0.2mgkg Ab for 6 doses - twice a week for 3 weeks more than doubled the mouse survival time in both Reh median survival time 20.5 vs. 42.5 days p0.001 and primary preB ALL median survival time 29.3 vs. 63 days p0.001 xenograft models. Our conjugate that uses CD22 Ab to target the novel molecule MXD3 which is highly expressed in preB ALL cells appears to be a promising novel therapeutic approach.",

FIRE-2 simulations achieve parsec-scale resolution to explicitly model the multiphase interstellar medium while implementing direct models for stellar evolution and feedback including stellar winds core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae radiation pressure photoionization and photoelectric heating. We release complete snapshots from three suites of simulations. The first comprises 20 simulations that zoom in on 14 Milky Way MW-mass galaxies five SMCLMC-mass galaxies and four lower-mass galaxies including one ultrafaint we release 39 snapshots across z 0-10. The second comprises four massive galaxies with 19 snapshots across z 1-10. Finally a high-redshift suite comprises 22 simulations with 11 snapshots across z 5-10. Each simulation also includes dozens of resolved lower-mass satellite galaxies in its zoom-in region. Snapshots include all stored properties for all dark matter gas and star particles including 11 elemental abundances for stars and gas and formation times ages of star particles. We also release accompanying subhalo catalogs which include galaxy properties and member star particles. For the simulations to z 0 including all MW-mass galaxies we release the formation coordinates and an ex situ flag for all star particles pointers to track particles across snapshots catalogs of stellar streams and multipole basis expansions for the halo mass distributions. We describe publicly available python packages for reading and analyzing these simulations.",

Two popular measures of such efficiency of a basis are sparsity measured by the expected p norm 0 p 1 and statistical independence measured by the mutual information. Gaining deeper understanding of their intricate relationship however remains elusive. Therefore we choose to study a simple synthetic stochastic process called the spike process which puts a unit impulse at a random location in an otherwise zero vector of length n in each realization. For this process we prove the following results 1 The standard basis is the best in terms of sparsity for all n 2 among all possible orthonormal bases in R n or all possible invertible linear transformations in R n with a fixed determinant value 2 The standard basis is again the best in terms of statistical independence if n 5 and the search of basis is restricted within all possible orthonormal bases in R n if 2 n 4 then the standard basis is not the best orthonormal basis in statistical independence 3 If we extend our basis search to all possible linear invertible transformations in R n then the best basis in statistical independence is not the standard basis for any n 2 4 The best basis in statistical independence is not unique in general and there even exist those which turn input spikes into completely dense vectors 5 There is no linear invertible transformation that achieves the true statistical independence for n 2. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS The American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6657 Trial prospectively enrolled women with 3 cm invasive breast cancer receiving NACT. Preoperative measurements of residual disease included longest diameter by mammography MRI and clinical examination and functional volume on MRI. The accuracy of preoperative measurements for detecting pathologic CR and the association with final pathology size were assessed for all lesions separately for single masses and nonmass enhancements NMEs multiple masses and lesions without ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS. RESULTS In the 138 women with all four preoperative measures longest diameter by MRI showed the highest accuracy for detecting pathologic CR for all lesions and NME AUC 0.76 and 0.84 respectively. There was little difference across preoperative measurements in the accuracy of detecting pathologic CR for single masses AUC 0.69-0.72. Longest diameter by MRI and longest diameter by clinical examination showed moderate ability for detecting pathologic CR for multiple masses AUC 0.78 and 0.74 and longest diameter by MRI and longest diameter by mammography showed moderate ability for detecting pathologic CR for tumors without DCIS AUC 0.74 and 0.71. In subjects with residual disease longest diameter by MRI exhibited the strongest association with pathology size for all lesions and single masses r 0.33 and 0.47. Associations between preoperative measures and pathology results were not significantly influenced by tumor subtype or mammographic density. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that measurement of longest diameter by MRI is more accurate than by mammography and clinical examination for preoperative assessment of tumor residua after NACT and may improve surgical planning.",

Compared to a 1996-1997 through 1998-1999 baseline by the 2005-2006 season both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths had decreased substantially in all age groups including a 47 95 confidence interval CI 38 to 54 reduction in nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia ICD9 code 481 with no codes indicating IPD in infants 2 years old and a 54 reduction CI 53 to 56 in adults 65 years of age. A model developed to calculate the total burden of pneumococcal pneumonia prevented by infant PCV7 vaccination in the United States from 2000 to 2006 estimated a reduction of 788838 CI 695406 to 875476 hospitalizations for pneumococcal pneumonia. Ninety percent of the reduction in model-attributed pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations occurred through herd immunity among adults 18 years old and older similar proportions were found in pneumococcal disease mortality prevented by the vaccine. In the first seasons after PCV introduction when there were substantial state differences in coverage among 5-year-olds states with greater coverage had significantly fewer influenza-associated pneumonia hospitalizations among children suggesting that PCV7 use also reduces influenza-attributable pneumonia hospitalizations.",

The composition of milk and the lactation strategies used to produce it are as diverse as the approximate 5400 species that rely on it for their survival. However not all milk is created equally and many species have unique strategies to ensure their lactational and reproductive success. As humans we continue to be increasingly-fascinated and conscious about the seemingly-obvious importance of breastfeeding infants. At the same time we benefit enormously from the harvest of nutritious safe and cheap milk from dairy animals. Fascinatingly all this nourishment comes from the mammary glands and their unique population of epithelium.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Depression may be associated with increased mortality risk but there are substantial limitations to existing studies assessing this relationship. We sought to overcome limitations of existing studies by conducting a large national longitudinal study to assess the impact of depression on all-cause and cause-specific risk of death. METHODS We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios associated with baseline depression diagnosis N849474 and three-year mortality among 5078082 patients treated in Veterans Health Administration VHA settings in fiscal year FY 2006. Cause of death was obtained from the National Death Index NDI. RESULTS Baseline depression was associated with 17 greater hazard of all-cause three-year mortality 95 CI hazard ratio HR 1.15 1.18 after adjusting for baseline patient demographic and clinical characteristics and VHA facility characteristics. Depression was associated with a higher hazard of three-year mortality from heart disease respiratory illness cerebrovascular disease accidents diabetes nephritis influenza Alzheimers disease septicemia suicide Parkinsons disease and hypertension. Depression was associated with a lower hazard of death from malignant neoplasm and liver disease. Depression was not associated with mortality due to assault. CONCLUSIONS In addition to being associated with suicide and injury-related causes of death depression is associated with increased risk of death from nearly all major medical causes independent of multiple major risk factors. Findings highlight the need to better understand and prevent mortality seen with multiple medical disorders associated with depression.",

    "abstract": "Constrained clustering has received much attention since its inception as the ability to add weak supervision into clustering has many uses. Most existing work is algorithm-specific limited to simple together and apart constraints and does not attempt to satisfy all constraints. This limits applications including where satisfying all constraints is required such as fairness. In this work we take the novel direction of post-processing the results of a clustering algorithm constrained or unconstrained as a combinatorial optimization problem to find the best allocation of instances to clusters whilst enforcing constraints. Experiments show that when evaluated on a ground truth our method is competitive in terms of clustering quality with the more recent approaches while being more computationally efficient. Finally since all constraints are satisfied our work can be applied to areas such as fairness including both group level and individual level fairness.",

    "abstract": "Plant mitochondrial genomes are usually assembled and displayed as circular maps based on the widely-held view across the broad community of life scientists that circular genome-sized molecules are the primary form of plant mitochondrial DNA despite the understanding by plant mitochondrial researchers that this is an inaccurate and outdated concept. Many plant mitochondrial genomes have one or more pairs of large repeats that can act as sites for inter- or intramolecular recombination leading to multiple alternative arrangements isoforms. Most mitochondrial genomes have been assembled using methods unable to capture the complete spectrum of isoforms within a species leading to an incomplete inference of their structure and recombinational activity. To document and investigate underlying reasons for structural diversity in plant mitochondrial DNA we used long-read PacBio and short-read Illumina sequencing data to assemble and compare mitochondrial genomes of domesticated Lactuca sativa and wild L. saligna and L. serriola lettuce species. We characterized a comprehensive complex set of isoforms within each species and compared genome structures between species. Physical analysis of L. sativa mtDNA molecules by fluorescence microscopy revealed a variety of linear branched and circular structures. The mitochondrial genomes for L. sativa and L. serriola were identical in sequence and arrangement and differed substantially from L. saligna indicating that the mitochondrial genome structure did not change during domestication. From the isoforms in our data we infer that recombination occurs at repeats of all sizes at variable frequencies. The differences in genome structure between L. saligna and the two other Lactuca species can be largely explained by rare recombination events that rearranged the structure. Our data demonstrate that representations of plant mitochondrial genomes as simple circular molecules are not accurate descriptions of their true nature and that in reality plant mitochondrial DNA is a complex dynamic mixture of forms.",

We show here that CYP2W1 exhibits tight binding affinities for retinoids which have low nanomolar binding constants and much poorer binding constants in the micromolar range for four other ligands. CYP2W1 converts all-transretinoic acid atRA to 4-hydroxyatRA and all-transretinol to 4-OH all-transretinol and it also oxidizes retinal. The enzyme much less efficiently oxidizes 17-estradiol to 2-hydroxy-17-estradiol and farnesol to a monohydroxylated product arachidonic acid is at best a negligible substrate. These findings indicate that CYP2W1 probably plays an important role in localized retinoid metabolism that may be intimately linked to its involvement in tumor development.",

We used simian immunodeficiency virus SIV-infected rhesus macaques as an animal model for HIV to determine pathogenic effects of SIV on intestinal T lymphocytes. Intestinal CD4 T-cell depletion and the potential for cytokine responses were examined during SIV infection and compared with results for lymphocytes from lymph nodes and blood. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated severe depletion of CD4CD8- single-positive T cells and CD4CD8 double-positive T cells in intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes LPL and intraepithelial lymphocytes IEL during primary SIV infection which persisted through the entire course of SIV infection. In contrast CD4 T-cell depletion was gradual in peripheral lymph nodes and blood. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular gamma interferon IFN-gamma and interleukin-4 IL-4 production following short-term mitogenic activation revealed that LPL retained same or higher capacity for IFN-gamma production in all stages of SIV infection compared to uninfected controls whereas peripheral blood mononuclear cells displayed a gradual decline. The CD8 T cells were the major producers of IFN-gamma. There was no detectable change in the frequency of IL-4-producing cells in both LPL and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus severe depletion of CD4 LPL and IEL in primary SIV infection accompanied by altered cytokine responses may reflect altered T-cell homeostasis in intestinal mucosa. This could be a mechanism of SIV-associated enteropathy and viral pathogenesis. Dynamic changes in intestinal T lymphocytes were not adequately represented in peripheral lymph nodes or blood.",

Here we consider key conceptual issues that have impeded progress in our understanding of hippocampal function and we review findings that establish the scope and limits of hippocampal involvement in navigation and memory. We argue that space and time serve as a primary scaffold to break up experiences into specific contexts and to organize multimodal input that is to be associated within a context. However the hippocampus is clearly capable of incorporating additional dimensions into the scaffold if they are determined to be relevant in the event-defined context. Conceiving of the hippocampal representation as constrained by immediate task demands-yet preferring axes that involve space and time-helps to reconcile an otherwise disparate set of findings on the core function of the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspIntroduction Adolescent and young adult AYA cancer survivors are at an increased risk of developing subsequent medical problems including asthmachronic obstructive pulmonary disorder cardiovascular disease diabetes and second cancers. However few population-based studies have focused on these risks in AYAs with NHL ALL or AML or considered whether the occurrence of these and other medical conditions differ by sociodemographic factors.jatsp jatspMethods Data for patients aged 15-39 when diagnosed with NHL n4459 ALL n1100 and AML n1107 during 1996-2012 and surviving a minimum of 2 years were obtained from the California Cancer Registry and followed in California hospital discharge databases. Discharge diagnoses were used to classify medical conditions as cardiac hypertensive disease ischemic heart disease other heart disease neurologic stroke seizure endocrine hypothyroidism diabetes ovariantesticular dysfunction other metabolic diseases respiratory asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease renal chronic kidney disease hemodialysis kidney transplant liver chronic liver disease pancreatitis cirrhosis liver transplant and avascular necrosis. Second cancers were obtained from the cancer registry. We estimated the cumulative incidence CMI of developing each condition 10-years after diagnosis accounting for death as a competing risk. We determined the impact of raceethnicity neighborhood socioeconomic status SES health insurance status and stem cell transplant SCT on the occurrence of each medical condition after adjusting for other demographic and clinical factors using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.jatsp jatspResults The most common medical conditions among AYA survivors at 10-years were cardiac CMI NHL 11.6 ALL 20.5 AML 18.2 endocrine CMI NHL 18.6 ALL 33.0 AML 25.9 and respiratory CMI NHL 5.1 ALL 7.7 AML 6.8 diseases. Avascular necrosis had the highest CMI in ALL patients CMI NHL 1.2 ALL 8.7 AML 2.5. Neurologic CMI NHL 2.1 ALL 4.5 AML 4.9 and liver CMI NHL 2.0 ALL 5.6 AML 4.4 were more common in survivors of ALL and AML than NHL. Second cancers 2.3-2.5 and renal diseases 2.2-3.5 were less common at 10-years. NHL survivors with advanced stage disease had a higher incidence of all medical conditions except second cancers. Chemotherapy was associated with a higher CMI of cardiac and endocrine conditions among NHL survivors these associations could not be assessed in ALL and AML patients as nearly all patients received chemotherapy. Initial radiation therapy was not associated with a higher CMI of medical conditions in NHL or ALL survivors but was associated with a higher CMI of respiratory renal and endocrine diseases in AML survivors. In multivariable models public or no insurance vs private was associated with a higher risk of most medical conditions in NHL and ALL survivors but not AML survivors Table. The risk of developing medical conditions varied by raceethnicity with Hispanics ALL survivors vs non-Hispanic whites at a higher risk of cardiac renal liver endocrine second cancers and neurologic diseases and black AML survivors at a higher risk of all medical conditions except endocrine diseases. AYAs with NHL who resided in lower SES neighborhoods were at a higher risk for developing cardiac respiratory and endocrine diseases AML survivors in lower SES neighborhoods had a higher risk of respiratory diseases. Across all cancers AYAs undergoing a SCT were at a higher risk of most medical conditions.jatsp jatspConclusion This study found that sociodemographic factors were associated with the risk of developing medical conditions in AYA NHL ALL and AML survivors. As expected the risk of medical conditions varied by cancer type and treatment with those undergoing SCT having a higher risk of medical conditions regardless of cancer type. NHL and ALL survivors who were uninsured or publicly insured were at a consistently higher risk of developing medical conditions as were Hispanic ALL survivors and Black AML survivors. Our findings highlight the higher burden of medical conditions in subgroups of cancer survivors that may relate to reduced access to preventive care early detectionintervention and long-term surveillance.jatsp jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspMuffly Shire Pharmaceuticals Research Funding Adaptive Biotechnologies Research Funding.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Crush Protection Device CPD could potentially decrease the severity of injuries and the number of fatalities in agricultural All-Terrain Vehicle ATV rollover crushes. CPD is a passive safety structure that protects the operator in ATV rollover incidents. The effectiveness of CPDs should be evaluated experimentally with an autonomous ATV in order to conduct repeatable and accurate rollover tests. The long-term goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of CPD in experimental ATV rollover accidents using an autonomous ATV which includes speed brake and steering control systems. This study aims to implement a Global Positioning System GPS based navigation that allows an autonomous ATV to follow a virtual path in the field. The system was designed and installed on a 4x4 Honda FourTrax Rancher ATV that is equipped with an electric power steering EPS. The autonomous steering system requires three major components 1 an accurate positioning system 2 a high-level controller equipped with the path-following feature and 3 a low-level controller that provides physical steering of the ATV handlebar. The position data was obtained by a Real-Time Kinematic RTK Global Navigation Satellite System GNSS system. The high-level controller was built based on the estimation algorithm Extended Kalman Filter EKF which allows centimeter accuracy in position. The proportional integral derivative PID controller with feedback was utilized in the low-level servo controller to precisely turn the EPS motor on the ATVs steering shaft. The performance of the GPS-based steering system was examined by calculating the position error of the autonomous ATV operating on a virtual path. By applying an accurate steering control system repeatable rollover simulations are expected in future field tests.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel method to compute triangle counting on GPUs. Unlike previous formulations of graph matching our approach is BFS-based by traversing the graph in an all-source-BFS manner and thus can be mapped onto GPUs in a massively parallel fashion. Our implementation uses the Gunrock programming model and we evaluate our implementation in runtime and memory consumption compared with previous state-of-the-art work. We sustain a peak traversed-edges-per-second TEPS rate of nearly 10 GTEPS. Our algorithm is the most scalable and parallel among all existing GPU implementations and also outperforms all existing CPU distributed implementations. This work specifically focuses on leveraging our implementation on the triangle counting problem for the Subgraph Isomorphism Graph Challenge 2019 demonstrating a geometric mean speedup over the 2018 champion of 3.84 times .",

The database will be searchable and cross-indexed with relevant publications including published detector descriptions. It should eventually contain all published data from older heavy-ion programs such as the Bevalac AGS SPS and FNAL fixed-target programs as well as published data from current programs at RHIC and new facilities at GSI FAIR KEKTsukuba and the LHC collider. This data includes all proton-proton proton-nucleus to nucleus-nucleus collisions as well as other relevant systems and all measured observables. Such a database would have tremendous scientific payoff as it makes systematic studies easier and allows simpler benchmarking of theoretical models to a broad range of experiments. To enhance the utility of the database we propose periodic data evaluations and topical reviews. These reviews would provide an alternative and impartial mechanism to resolve discrepancies between published data from rival experiments and between theory and experiment. Since this database will be a community resource it requires the high-energy nuclear physics communitys financial and manpower support. jatsp",

Therefore mouse xenograft models are commonly used to study human leukemia biology and to develop new therapeutics. Leukemia can be maintained and expanded through serial transplantations. Although many mouse models with different types of leukemia mouse strains and inoculation methods have been used there are very few studies validating the models.jatsp jatspWe have established acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL mouse models using primary ALL samples and NODSCIDIL2Rg null NSG mice. In order to increase engraftment efficiency we transplanted leukemia cells into healthy adult mice via intra-bone marrow BM injection 1 to 100 million cells per mouse to tibia bilaterally. To our knowledge the model with primary ALL samples in NSG mice via intra-BM injection is novel. A total of 9 samples 2 T cell ALL and 7 precursor B preB ALL were transplanted into cohorts of 3 to 8 mice each. Of these 1 T cell ALL and 6 preB ALL samples engrafted and 1 T cell and 1 preB ALL sample failed to engraft. Leukemia engraftment was observed between 10 to 33 weeks after transplantation. In each cohort each mouse developed leukemia at approximately the same time after leukemia transplantation. Necropsy showed significant hepatosplenomegaly and white BM in all mice indicating leukemia infiltration. Cells were harvested from BM spleen and other leukemia-infiltrated organs and confirmed to be human origin by flow cytometry using anti-HLA-ABC and anti- human CD45 antibodies. Nearly 100 of BM was replaced with human leukemia cells.jatsp jatspOne T cell and 1 preB ALL sample have been serially transplanted using the same method as the primary transplantation to quaternary and tertiary generations respectively. We observed that the time to develop leukemia became shorter with each transplantation 16 weeks for the first transplantation and 10 weeks for the tertiary transplantation in a T cell ALL sample. Some mice transplanted with a preB ALL sample developed chloroma. Interestingly chloroma development was consistently observed with this sample which was transferred through serial transplantation although the patient did not develop chloroma. Morphology and immunophenotype were similar to the original leukemia. There were some changes in CD expression patterns however immunophenotyping was consistent with the original leukemia.jatsp jatspTo help understand phenotype progression in transplanted leukemia samples we are currently comparing the transcriptome profiles of leukemia samples obtained from the patient primary and quaternary mice for T cell ALL and primary and tertiary mice for preB ALL samples preB ALL patient sample not available. Next-generation sequencing NGS-based RNA-Sequencing RNA-Seq is in progress for this analysis. In addition to obtaining digital expression profiles and differential gene expression RNA-Seq analysis will reveal the complete repertoire of splice variants point mutations and fusion transcripts in the ALL samples. Complete results of these analyses for our mouse models with both T cell and preB ALL will be presented. Thus this technique will provide the most detailed transcriptomic analysis and no validation studies have yet been reported on ALL samples sequentially engrafted NSG mice using RNA-Seq.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

However we exhibit one chiral 8-crossing knot and one chiral 9-crossing knot which can be unknotted by either crossing change. Furthermore we address the question analytically using results of Taniyama and Traczyk. We apply Taniyamas classification of unknotting operations to chiral rational knots and fully classify all those which in a single step can be unknotted by either type of crossing change the first of these is 813. As a corollary we obtain Stoimenows result that all chiral twist knots can be unknotted by only one of the two crossing change types - or -. Thus as was observed numerically all chiral knots with unknotting number one and seven or fewer crossings can be unknotted by only one of the two crossing change types. Traczyks results allow us to address the question for some non-rational chiral unknotting number one knots with 9 or fewer crossings however for others the question remains open. We propose a numerical approach for investigating the latter type of knot. We also discuss the implications of our work in the context of DNA topology.

These two systems involve gels which are mixtures composed of a polymer network permeated by water. The fluid mechanics of these systems is essential to their biological function and structure. Their mathematical descriptions must account for the mechanics of the polymer the water and the interaction between these two phases. This review focuses on multiphase flow models because this framework is natural for including the relative motion between the phases the exchange of material between phases and the additional stresses within the network that arise from nonspecific chemical interactions and the action of molecular motors. These models have been successful in accounting for how different forces are generated and transmitted to achieve cell motion and biofilm growth and they have demonstrated how emergent structures develop though the interactions of the two phases. A short description of multiphase flow models of tumor growth is included to highlight the flexibility of the model in describing diverse biological applications.",

    "abstract": "There have been ongoing attempts to create new rapid sensory methods that allow one to have similar outcomes to conventional descriptive analysis but with less training and time. Check-all-that-apply and rate-all-that-apply methods seem to work very well when relatively large numbers of consumers are involved and with relatively more considerable differences among the samples in a product set. In this study results from well-trained descriptive analysis panels were compared to those obtained by using a modified descriptive analysis modified rate-all-that-apply and modified check-all-that-apply with shortened training times and with small panel size. The number of significant attributes and the number of sample pairs that were significantly different was counted. The results indicate that modified rate-all-that-apply can have an equivalent discrimination ability as descriptive analysis when the product set included subtly different samples. Practical Applications Based on this studys results it would seem that the modified rate-all-that-apply with three replications could be an adequate substitute for descriptive analysis in complex samples. The modified rate-all-that-apply technique works well especially when sensory attributes and reference standards are available for ballot training.",

This paper reports Part II of our work which utilized data gathered in two strawberry fields during harvesting to estimate the stochastic parameters involved in modeling pickers and evaluate the prediction accuracy of the simulator for all-manual picking. Then as a case study non-productive time and harvest efficiency were estimated for robot-aided harvesting for various picker-robot ratios and three priority-based reactive dispatching strategies for the robots. The simulator predicted the pickers non-productive time during all-manual harvesting with 6.4 3 and 1.2 errors for the morning afternoon and all-day harvesting shifts respectively. Statistical testing verified that predicted non-productive times followed the same distributions as the measured non-productive times 5 significance level. Simulations robustness was assessed by using morning data to simulate afternoon harvesting and vice-versa non-productive times distributions were predicted accurately 10 significance level. Robot-aided simulation results using the calibrated simulator for a 25-picker crew showed that all-manual harvest efficiencies of 81.8 and 78.2 for morning and afternoon shifts increased to 92 and 86.5 respectively when five robots were deployed. Different scheduling policies did not affect efficiency when more than five robots were used because there were always enough robots to serve pickers requests immediately. Also harvest efficiency plateaued when more than five robots were used as a consequence of the time needed for a robot to travel to a picker.",

    "abstract": "Polymerase chain reaction PCR based clonality assays are an important tool to differentiate neoplastic from reactive lymphocyte populations. A recent description of the canine T cell receptor locus identified a large number of formerly unknown genes and determined the locus topology consisting of 8 cassettes with up to 3 variable V genes 2 joining J genes and one constant C gene each. Given that these data were not available when existing canine T cell clonality assays were developed it is likely that they will fail to detect a subset of clonal lymphocyte populations. The objective of this study was to gauge the potential of canine T cell clonality assays to detect all rearranged T cell receptor genes and to develop an improved clonality assay. The primer sequences of existing clonality assays were aligned to the reference sequences of all rearranged genes and genes were scored as to the likelihood of being recognized by a primer. All four assays likely recognized subgroup V2 and V6 genes but 3 out of 4 assays were unlikely to detect subgroup V3 and V7 genes. All assays likely recognized Jx-2 genes but only two assays were likely to detect most Jx-1 genes. Two assays had forward primers located as close as four nucleotides to the junctional region. A new multiplex PCR was designed with all primers combined in a single tube. An alternative primer set allowed identification of variable gene usage through gene specific forward primers. The coverage of all rearranged genes facilitated the detection of multiple clonal rearrangements per neoplastic sample. The new assay detected clonal DNA at a concentration of 5 within polyclonal background but detection thresholds were dependent on the gene usage of clonal rearrangements as well as the position of the clonal peak in respect to the polyclonal background. The new multiplex assay recognized 1212 100 of confirmed neoplastic samples as compared to 212 17 by an existing assay. On a series of 60 diagnostic samples the concordance rate of both assays was 4160 68.3. In 1460 23.3 of the cases the new multiplex assay yielded a clonal result while the existing assay gave a non-clonal result. In 560 8.3 of cases the new assay yielded a non-clonal result while the existing primer set gave a clonal result. These findings suggest that the new multiplex assay has an improved sensitivity over traditional assays and is suited to reduce the rate of false-negative results.",

ANIMALS 10 dogs. PROCEDURES Desflurane was administered at 1.5 times the individuals MAC iMAC and 1.5 times the groups MAC gMAC. The order of concentrations was randomly selected. Heart rate respiratory rate arterial blood pressure central venous pressure mean pulmonary artery pressure pulmonary artery occlusion pressure arterial and mixed-venous blood gas tensions and pH and cardiac output were measured. The desflurane concentration required to achieve a mean arterial pressure MAP of 60 mm Hg was then determined. Finally the desflurane concentration required to achieve an end-tidal PCO2 of 55 mm Hg was measured. RESULTS Variances when administering 1.5 iMAC or 1.5 gMAC were not significantly different for any variable studied. Differences between the MAC multiples needed to reach an MAP of 60 mm Hg and the mean of the sample were significantly larger when gMAC was used compared with iMAC indicating that a multiple of iMAC better predicted the concentration resulting in a MAP of 60 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggest that in a small group of dogs variability in cardiorespiratory measurements among dogs is unlikely to differ whether an inhalant anesthetic is administered at a multiple of the iMAC in each dog or at an identical gMAC in all dogs.",

Several PFAS have been associated with cancers in adults yet little is known about the risk in children. We investigated whether PFAS concentrations in residential dust were associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL. Vacuum bags were collected in homes of 178 children diagnosed with ALL and 204 healthy controls age 0-7 years residing in California 2001-2007. Dust samples were sieved and analyzed for 19 PFAS using targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The effects of individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures were estimated for eight PFAS with at least 50 above the limit of quantification LOQ using logistic regression G-computation and generalized additive modeling GAM. In the model mutually adjusting for eight PFAS a statistically significant association was seen only for N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid EtFOSAA ORcontinuous 1.40 95 CI 1.05-1.86 and OR 4 th vs . 1 st quartile 2.58 mathrmOR_4mathrmth mathrmvs.1mathrmst mathrmquartile2.58 95 CI 1.16-5.71.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate trends in urolith composition in dogs and to assess risk factors for urolithiasis including age breed sex neuter status urolith location and bacterial urolith cultures. SAMPLE POPULATION A total of 10 444 uroliths and the dogs from which they were obtained. METHODS The laboratory database at the UC Davis Gerald V. Ling Urinary Stone Analysis Laboratory was searched for all urolith submissions from dogs between January 2006 and December 2018. Mineral type age breed sex neuter status urolith location and urolith culture were recorded. Trends were evaluated and variables compared to evaluate risk factors. RESULTS Calcium oxalate CaOx and struvite-containing uroliths comprised the majority of all submissions from dogs representing 47.0 and 43.6 respectively. The proportion of CaOx-containing uroliths significantly decreased from 49.5 in 2006 to 41.8 in 2018 P .006 with no change in the proportion of struvite-containing urolith submissions. Cystine-containing uroliths comprised 2.7 of all submissions between 2006 and 2018 and a significant nonlinear increase in this mineral type occurred over time 1.4 of all submissions in 2006 to 8.7 in 2018 P .001. Of all cystine-containing uroliths 70.3 were from intact male dogs. Age breed and sex predispositions for uroliths were similar to those previously identified. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Although calcium oxalate- and struvite-containing uroliths continue to be the most common uroliths submitted from dogs a decrease in the proportion of CaOx-containing uroliths and an increase in the proportion of cystine-containing uroliths occurred during the time period evaluated.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study assessed the effects of a community outreach and education model implemented as part of the Early Detection Intervention and Prevention of Psychosis Program EDIPPP a national multisite study in six U.S. regions. METHODS EDIPPPs model was designed to generate rapid referrals of youths at clinical high risk of psychosis by creating a network of professionals and community members trained to identify signs of early psychosis. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered through an evaluation of outreach efforts at five sites over a two-year period and through interviews with staff at all six sites. All outreach activities to groups educational medical and mental health professionals community groups media youth and parent groups and multicultural communities were counted for the six sites to determine correlations with total referrals and enrollments. RESULTS During the study period May 2007-May 2010 848 formal presentations were made to 22840 attendees and 145 informal presentations were made to 11528 attendees at all six sites. These presentations led to 1652 phone referrals. A total of 520 31 of these individuals were offered in-person orientation and 392 75 of those were assessed for eligibility. A total of 337 individuals 86 of those assessed met criteria for assignment to the EDIPPP study. CONCLUSIONS EDIPPPs outreach and education model demonstrated the effectiveness of following a protocol-defined outreach strategy combined with flexibility to reach culturally diverse audiences or initially inaccessible systems. All EDIPPP sites yielded appropriate referrals of youths at risk of psychosis.",

    "abstract": "Recently a moderate amount of work has been reported on the use of overlay networks to support value-added network services such as multicasting Quality-of-Service QoS security etc. To design an overlay network the first step is to choose an overlay topology connecting all the overlay service nodes. When considering overlay topologies several questions need to be answered first How overlay topologies affect overlay routing performance Which topologies can provide satisfactory performance How can we construct efficient overlay topologies connecting all the overlay nodes In this paper we focus on the overlay network topology construction issue. First we evaluate and compare the performance and overhead of the existing overlay topologies. Second we formalize the overlay topology construction problem and propose two new heuristic methods to construct efficient overlay topologies. Simulation results have demonstrated the efficiency of the two proposed approaches. It is shown that overlay service performance varies significantly with respect to different overlay topologies. Thus it is important to choose an appropriate overlay network topology. The knowledge of IP-layer topology information also benefits significantly in constructing efficient overlay topologies as inferred from the results. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the open water propeller characteristics and the four-quadrant propeller models as applied to a torpedo-shaped underwater vehicle. A series of experiments with a Gavia autonomous underwater vehicle propeller were conducted in the towing tank using a rotor testing apparatus. The purpose of these tests was to measure the propeller thrust and torque under varying flow conditions and then to be used as the basis of the developed propeller models. These mathematical models were constructed using two regression models a polynomial and a Fourier series. Model coefficients were derived using the method of least squares and a comparison analysis was also conducted to test the robustness of the methodology. Results show that the Fourier series models were able to produce a reasonable and accurate approximation of thrust and torque coefficients with a small number of parameters in the examined condition of this study. The obtained four-quadrant open water characteristics of the autonomous underwater vehicle propeller model would be utilised to improve the system mathematical model for more accurate simulation and controller design to compare the autonomous underwater vehicle performance equipped with different propulsion units and to validate computational fluid dynamic results.",

    "abstract": "From February 2020 to March 2022 four southern sea otters Enhydra lutris nereis stranded in California with severe protozoal steatitis and systemic toxoplasmosis. Three of the infected otters stranded within 26 km of each other and all four animals died during periods of increased rainfall-driven surface water runoff. High parasite burdens were observed in all tissues except the central nervous system and toxoplasmosis with severe protozoal steatitis was the primary cause of death for all cases. This lesion pattern differs substantially from all prior reports of toxoplasmosis in sea otters. All cases were T. gondii-positive via serology immunohistochemistry and PCR. Multilocus sequence typing at 13 loci revealed that all were infected with the same strain of T. gondii previously characterized as an atypical and rare genotype in North America TgCgCa1 or COUG. The COUG genotype was first isolated from mountain lions in British Columbia Canada during investigation of a waterborne outbreak of toxoplasmosis in humans. This genotype has not been previously reported from sea otters nor any aquatic species. All prior T. gondii strains obtained from 140 southern sea otters represent Type II or Type X strains or variants of these genotypes. Archival necropsy data 1000 animals over 24 years were negative for prior cases of severe T. gondii-associated steatitis prior to the cases described herein and no sublethal COUG T. gondii infections have been previously indentified in sea otters. According to prior studies the T. gondii COUG genotype is highly virulent in mice and is unusual among T. gondii isolates in eliciting a Type I interferon response in murine and human cells in vitro this unusual immunomodulatory response could explain the apparent high virulence of this atypical T. gondii strain. Our findings reveal a novel and concerning lesion pattern for sea otters with toxoplasmosis. Due to high zoonotic potential and the risk of infection via shared marine food resources these findings may also indicate potential health threats for other animals and humans.",

We have now extended the study to heteromultimeric channels consisting of various numbers of mutant subunits as well as channels without mutant subunits all in the background of a chimeric Shaker channel having increased conductance. It has been found that activation-coupled sublevels exist in all these channel types and are traversed in at least 80 of all deactivation time courses. In symmetric K solutions the currents in the two sublevels have a linear voltage dependence being 23-44 and 54-70 of the fully open conductance. Sublevels in different channel types share similar voltage dependence of the mean lifetime and similar ion selectivity properties. However the mean lifetime of each current level depends approximately geometrically on the number of mutant subunits in the channel becoming shorter in channels having fewer mutant subunits. Each mutant subunit appears to stabilize all of the conducting states by approximately 0.5 kcalmol. Consistent with previous results in the mutant channel sublevels in channels with two or no mutant subunits also showed ion selectivities that differ from that of the fully open level having relatively higher K than Rb conductances. A model is presented in which Shaker channels have two coupled activation gates one associated with the selectivity filter and a second associated with the S6 helix bundle.",

Consistent with prior studies AYA ALL patients treated at non-teaching hospitals have inferior survival. Although the landscape of ALL therapy is changing these data provide an important snapshot of the modern state of HCT in CR1 for AYA ALL.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspMuffly Shire Pharmaceuticals Research Funding Adaptive Biotechnologies Research Funding.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Conventional chemotherapy for precursor B-cell preB acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ALL has limitations that could be overcome by targeted therapy. Previously we discovered a potential therapeutic molecular target MDX3 MAX dimerization protein 3 in preB ALL. In this study we hypothesize that an effective siRNA therapy for preB ALL can be developed using antiCD22 antibody CD22 Ab and nanoparticles. We composed nanocomplexes with super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles SPIO NPs CD22 Abs and MXD3 siRNA molecules based on physical interactions between the molecules. We demonstrated that the MXD3 siRNA-CD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes entered leukaemia cells and knocked down MXD3 leading the cells to undergo apoptosis and resulting in decreased live cell counts in the cell line Reh and in primary preB ALL samples in vitro. Furthermore the cytotoxic effects of the MXD3 siRNA-CD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes were significantly enhanced by addition of the chemotherapy drugs vincristine or doxorubicin. We also ruled out potential cytotoxic effects of the MXD3 siRNA-CD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes on normal primary haematopoietic cells. Normal B cells were affected while CD34-positive haematopoietic stem cells and non-B cells were not. These data suggest that MXD3 siRNA-CD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes have the potential to be a new targeted therapy for preB ALL.",

Data from 280 cases from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders are presented. Each case had a complete USSLB staging and at least 1 full research clinical assessment including subspecialty neurologist-administered movement and cognitive evaluation. Of the 280 25.7 were cognitively normal 8.6 had mild cognitive impairment and 65.7 had dementia. All cases could be categorized into 1 of 5 USSLB stages 8.6 stage I-olfactory bulb only 15.4 IIa-brainstem predominant 13.6 IIb-limbic predominant 31.8 III-brainstem and limbic and 30.7 IV-neocortical yet using the Braak staging system 70 cases 25.3 could not be classified. Those with USSLB stages III and IV died at a younger age. Multiple measures of motor parkinsonism cognitive impairment hyposmia and probable RBD were significantly correlated with increasing USSLB stage. We conclude that the USSLB is the most comprehensive staging system for all Lewy body disorders and allows for categorization and ranking of all brains with significant correlations to many motor and nonmotor clinical signs and symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. The higher phylogeny of the Formicidae was analysed using 68 characters and 19 taxa the 14 currently recognized ant subfamilies plus 5 potentially critical infrasubfamilial taxa. The results justified the recognition of 3 additional subfamilies Aenictogitoninae Ashmead new status Apomyrminae Dlussky Fedoseeva new status and Leptanilloidinae Bolton new subfamily. A second analysis on these better delimited 17 subfamilies resulted in 24 equally most parsimonious trees. All trees showed a basal division of extant Formicidae into two groups the first containing Myrmicinae Pseudomyrmecinae Nothomyrmeciinae Myrmeciinae Formicinae Dolichoderinae Aneuretinae and the second the remaining subfamilies. Clades appearing within these groups included the Cerapachyinae plus army ants the Nothomyrmeciinae plus Myrmeciinae the formicoid subfamilies Aneuretinae Dolichoderinae Formicinae and the Old World army ants Aenictinae Aenictogitoninae Doryline but relationships within the last two groups were not resolved and the relative positions of the Apomyrminae Leptanillinae and Ponerinae remained ambiguous. Moreover a bootstrap analysis produced a consensus tree in which all branches were represented in proportions much lower than 95. A reconstruction of the ground plan of the Formicidae indicated that the most specialized of all recent ants are the members of the subfamily Dorylinae and the least specialized ones are the monotypic Apomyrminae.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Studies have demonstrated superior outcomes for adolescent and young adult AYA patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL who are treated using pediatric versus adult therapeutic regimens. To the best of our knowledge whether adult oncologists in the United States have adopted this approach to ALL in AYA patients is currently unknown. The objective of the current study was to provide a population-based description of ALL treatment patterns in AYA individuals over the past decade. METHODS Data regarding AYA patients aged 15 to 39 years and diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2014 while living in the Greater Bay Area were obtained from the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry GBACR. Treating facilities were designated as pediatric or adult centers induction treatment regimens were abstracted from registry text data fields. RESULTS Of 304 patients diagnosed in the GBACR catchment region complete treatment data were available for 229 75. The location of care was identified for 296 patients 97 treated at 31 unique centers. Approximately 70 of AYA patients received induction therapy at an adult treatment center. All AYA patients who were treated at pediatric centers received pediatric ALL regimens. Among AYA patients treated by adult oncologists with complete treatment data none received a pediatric regimen before 2008. Between 2008 and 2012 while the US Adult Intergroup C10403 pediatric-inspired ALL protocol was open to accrual 31 of AYA patients treated by adult oncologists received pediatric regimens. This rate fell to 21 from 2013 through 2014. Adult facilities treating 2 AYA patients with ALL per year captured in the GBACR were more likely to administer pediatric regimens than lower volume centers P .03. CONCLUSIONS As of 2014 only a minority of AYA patients with ALL received pediatric ALL regimens at adult cancer centers. Cancer 2017122-130. 2016 American Cancer Society.",

    "abstract": "Habitat maps are often the core spatially consistent data set on which marine reserve networks are designed but their efficacy as surrogates for species richness and applicability to other conservation measures is poorly understood. Combining an analysis of field survey data literature review and expert assessment by a multidisciplinary working group we examined the degree to which Caribbean coastal habitats provide useful planning information on 4 conservation measures species richness the ecological functions of fish species ecosystem processes and ecosystem services. Approximately one-quarter to one-third of benthic invertebrate species and fish species disaggregated by life phase hereafter fish species occurred in a single habitat and Montastraea-dominated forereefs consistently had the highest richness of all species processes and services. All 11 habitats were needed to represent all 277 fish species in the seascape although reducing the conservation target to 95 of species approximately halved the number of habitats required to ensure representation. Species accumulation indices SAIs were used to compare the efficacy of surrogates and revealed that fish species were a more appropriate surrogate of benthic species SAI 71 than benthic species were for fishes SAI 42. Species of reef fishes were also distributed more widely across the seascape than invertebrates and therefore their use as a surrogate simultaneously included mangroves sea grass and coral reef habitats. Functional classes of fishes served as effective surrogates of fish and benthic species which given their ease to survey makes them a particularly useful measure for conservation planning. Ecosystem processes and services exhibited great redundancy among habitats and were ineffective as surrogates of species. Therefore processes and services in this case were generally unsuitable for a complementarity-based approach to reserve design. In contrast the representation of species or functional classes ensured inclusion of all processes and services in the reserve network.",

In this study mice were fed 1 mgday quercetin in the form of quercetin aglycone rutin apple or onion and reduced glutathione GSH oxidized glutathione GSSG and protein-GSH mixed disulfides were determined to investigate the influence of dietary quercetin on the GSH redox status in metabolically active tissues mitochondria and plasma of mice. All quercetin treatment groups produced increases in the GSHGSSG ratio and decreases in mixed disulfide levels in hepatic tissue. Cardiac tissue did not change in response to dietary quercetin however cardiac mitochondria demonstrated a reduction in the GSHGSSG ratio and an increase in protein mixed disulfide levels. No significant changes were observed in the plasma GSHGSSG ratio but mixed disulfide levels were decreased for all of the diets. The changes in plasma redox status did not parallel the changes in the tissues. Onion fed mice demonstrated the greatest increases in GSHGSSG ratios and the greatest decreases in protein mixed disulfide levels of all diets compared. For all treatment groups increases in the GSHGSSG ratios corresponded with decreases in protein mixed disulfide levels. The results of this study indicate that quercetin influences GSHGSSG ratios and protein thiolation in a tissue-specific manner and that these effects are dependent on food source and bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "CASE DESCRIPTION 6 lactating dairy goats were examined because of acute mastitis. CLINICAL FINDINGS Goats were considered to have endotoxemia on the basis of physical examination and clinicopathologic findings. The affected udder halves had gangrenous discolored distal portions with sharp demarcations from grossly normal tissue proximally. Udder secretions from the affected sides were serosanguineous in all cases. A Bacillus sp was isolated in pure cultures in all cases. In 1 case the Bacillus sp was identified as Bacillus cereus. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Goats were treated for mastitis and endotoxemia with polyionic IV fluid therapy systemic and intramammary antimicrobial administration anti-inflammatory drug administration and other supportive treatment. All goats survived to discharge. All except 1 goat had follow-up information available. The affected udder halves sloughed in 1 to 2 months following discharge. In subsequent lactations after the mastitis episodes milk production in 2 of 5 goats was above the mean as determined on the basis of Dairy Herd Improvement records and 3 of 5 goats were voluntarily withdrawn from lactation. All 5 goats had successful kiddings after the Bacillus mastitis episode. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Bacillus sp should be considered as a causative agent in goats with gangrenous mastitis especially when the Bacillus sp is isolated in a pure culture. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing is recommended for selection of an appropriate antimicrobial for treatment. Prognosis for survival appears to be good although milk production may be decreased.",

    "abstract": "Building on decades of scholarship critiquing scientist representation in classrooms and textbooks the present study characterizes the lifetime experiences of undergraduate students regarding their perceptions of scientists and science identity. Informed by the theoretical framework of Cultural Learning Pathways CLP we conducted 31 semistructured interviews with undergraduates who completed six Scientist Spotlights scientistspotlights.org which are inclusive curricular supplements that feature counterstereotypical scientists. Despite decades of progress in curricular representation our results revealed almost all students 94 n 29 recounted exposure to predominantly if not exclusively stereotypical scientists across social institutions e.g. media K12 universities healthcare environments throughout their lifetime which limited their Scopes of Possibility to pursue science. All students 100 n 31 reported that Scientist Spotlights enhanced Scopes of Possibility for themselves and others from marginalized backgrounds to pursue science. Last almost all students 97 n 30 shared characteristics they hoped to see when imagining Scopes of Possibility emphasizing the need for a concerted effort to increase representation of counterstereotypical scientists across science curriculum and social institutions more broadly.",

    "abstract": "The search for efficient approaches to realize local switching of magnetic moments in spintronic devices has attracted extensive attention. One of the most promising approaches is the electrical manipulation of magnetization through electron-mediated spin torque. However the Joule heat generated via electron motion unavoidably causes substantial energy dissipation and potential damage to spintronic devices. Here all-oxide heterostructures of SrRuO3 NiOSrIrO3 are epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 single-crystal substrates following the order of the ferromagnetic transition metal oxide SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy insulating and antiferromagnetic NiO and metallic transition metal oxide SrIrO3 with strong spin-orbit coupling. It is demonstrated that instead of the electron spin torques the magnon torques present in the antiferromagnetic NiO layer can directly manipulate the perpendicular magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. This magnon mechanism may significantly reduce the electron motion-related energy dissipation from electron-mediated spin currents. Interestingly the threshold current density to generate a sufficient magnon current to manipulate the magnetization is one order of magnitude smaller than that in conventional metallic systems. These findings suggest a route for developing highly efficient all-oxide spintronic devices operated by magnon current.",

The pathogenesis and transmission potential of this virus along with two genetically related and widely studied viruses chickenCalifornia2002 and chickenBelize2008 were evaluated in both 3-week- and 62-week-old chickens given a low medium or high challenge dose. All three viruses were highly virulent causing clinical signs killing all the chickens in the medium and high dose groups and efficiently transmitting to contacts. The three viruses also replicated in the reproductive tract of the adult hens. Virus shedding for all viruses was detected 24 hours after challenge peaking with high titers at day 4 post challenge.

    "abstract": "Nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient in irrigated rice Oryza sativa L. production and growers continue to be faced with the challenge of meeting crop N demand particularly in organic production systems. The main objective of this study was to determine how rice yield was affected by seasonal availability of N from organic sources under continuously and noncontinuously flooded conditions. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the commonly used poultry litter pelletized organic fertilizers blood meat and feather meal 13-0-0 feather meal 12-0-0 poultry litter plus feather meal 6-3-2 and NH 4 2SO 4 in synchronizing the supply of mineralized N with the demand of N by rice. The N mineralization of all organic fertilizers occurred primarily during the first 53 d after planting results which were confirmed subsequently in a laboratory incubation study. In all fields fertilizers increased grain yield and N uptake relative to a zero N control. Relative to poultry litter the pelletized fertilizers resulted in higher yields 9980 vs. 9267 kg ha -1 N uptake 140 vs. 114 kg ha -1 and N recovery efficiency 35 vs. 20 in all fields. It was concluded that pelletized fertilizers were significantly more effective than poultry litter in supplying N to the crop when fields were continuously flooded. In contrast all organic fertilizers were less effective in supplying N when fields were drained for weed control due to lower N recovery efficiency 26 and N loss through denitrify cation indicating that organic fertilizer application may not be economically viable under such circumstances. 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy.

First the paper analyses an all-to-all single AWGR passive interconnection with N nodes and proposes a new architecture that overcomes the scalability limitation given by wavelength registration and crosstalk by introducing multiples of smaller AWGRs W W operating on a fewer number of wavelengths W N. Second this paper demonstrates active AWGR switching with a distributed control plane to be used when the size of the interconnection network makes the all-to-all approach using passive AWGRs impractical. In particular an active AWGR-based TONAK switch is introduced. TONAK combines an all-optical NACK technique which removes the need for electrical buffers at the switch inputoutput ports and a TOKEN technique which enables a distributed all-optical arbiter to handle packet contention. The experimental validation and performance study of the AWGR-based TONAK switch is presented demonstrating the feasibility of the TONAK solution and the high throughput and low average packet latency for an up to 75 offered load. 2013 IEEE.",

In this study face-validity of the Modified National ED OverCrowding Score mNEDOCS was assessed in a high-volume ED as well as in a low-volume ED. METHODS A prospective observational cohort study was performed in the Netherlands. The correlation of the mNEDOCS with ED staff perceptions of crowding were assessed using weighted Kappa and Pearson correlation. Subsequently ED process measures elapsed target times to triage elapsed target times to treatment and patients LOS were described under different levels of ED crowding. RESULTS Correlation between the categorized crowding scores was low weighted 0.34 resp. 0.26. However good correlations of 0.73 and 0.82 were found between the uncategorized mNEDOCS and ED staffs perception of crowding. Percentages of patients with elapsed target times to treatment increased simultaneously with increasingly busy periods when measured with mNEDOCS. CONCLUSIONS The uncategorized mNEDOCS correlates well with perceived crowding even at a low-volume ED. Determining a cut-off level at which a specific ED can be identified as crowded is important because the predefined mNEDOCS categories may not be optimal for all EDs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Rapidly characterizing the operational interrelationships among all genes in a given organism is a critical bottleneck to significantly advancing our understanding of thousands of newly sequenced microbial and eukaryotic species. While evolving technologies for global profiling of transcripts proteins and metabolites are making it possible to comprehensively survey cellular physiology in newly sequenced organisms these experimental techniques have not kept pace with sequencing efforts. Compounding these technological challenges is the fact that individual experiments typically only stimulate relatively small-scale cellular responses thus requiring numerous expensive experiments to survey the operational relationships among nearly all genetic elements. Therefore a relatively quick and inexpensive strategy for observing changes in large fractions of the genetic elements is highly desirable. RESULTS We have discovered in the model organism Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 that batch culturing in complex medium stimulates meaningful changes in the expression of approximately two thirds of all genes. While the majority of these changes occur during transition from rapid exponential growth to the stationary phase several transient physiological states were detected beyond what has been previously observed. In sum integrated analysis of transcript and metabolite changes has helped uncover growth phase-associated physiologies operational interrelationships among two thirds of all genes specialized functions for gene family members waves of transcription factor activities and growth phase associated cell morphology control. CONCLUSIONS Simple laboratory culturing in complex medium can be enormously informative regarding the activities of and interrelationships among a large fraction of all genes in an organism. This also yields important baseline physiological context for designing specific perturbation experiments at different phases of growth. The integration of such growth and perturbation studies with measurements of associated environmental factor changes is a practical and economical route for the elucidation of comprehensive systems-level models of biological systems.",

However this regimens efficacy and tolerability have yet to be externally validated. Here we summarize our real-world experience with ponatinib hyper-CVAD for untreated Ph ALL and other Ph acute or blast phase leukemias.jatsp jatspMethodsjatsp jatspWe retrospectively analyzed all adults treated at the University of California Davis UCD from March 2012 to May 2021 with ponatinib hyper-CVAD upfront. The primary endpoints were 3-year OS and EFS. Secondary endpoints were complete molecular response CMR measurable residual disease MRD negativity by multiparameter flow cytometry MFC complete cytogenetic response CCyR rates and adverse events AEs. Time to event analyses were done via the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients alive were censored at their last follow-up date. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant HCT after 6 months of achieving complete remission CR were censored at the time of HCT for the landmark analysis. Patients with missing data were excluded from the response analyses.jatsp jatspResultsjatsp jatspWe identified 13 Ph ALL patients who received ponatinib hyper-CVAD for initial induction. The baseline characteristics for the Ph ALL patients are summarized in Table 1. The median follow-up was 16 months. The median number of hyper-CVAD cycles completed was 8 range 1-8 with ponatinib. Two patients proceeded to HCT in CR1 one at 3.5 months after starting induction and due to difficulty controlling the patients concurrent multiple myeloma prior to HCT and recovery from anti-neoplastic therapy the second was delayed to 46 months after starting induction.jatsp jatspThe 3-year OS and EFS with ponatinib hyper-CVAD were each 92 95 confidence interval 78.9-100 Figure 1. Landmark analysis completed 6 months following CR showed a 3-year OS of 100 in patients treated with ponatinib hyper-CVAD without HCT in first CR CR1. The CMR CCyR and MRD-negativity by MFC rates with ponatinib were all 92.3 1213. The median time to CMR CCyR and MRD-negativity by MFC were 51 days 22 days and 53 days respectively.jatsp jatspNotable AEs with ponatinib include neutropenic fever 92 bacterial infection 69 transaminitis 38 venous thromboembolism 31 invasive fungal infection 15 hemorrhage 15 cerebrovascular accident CVA 15 and tumor lysis syndrome 8. One patient died during induction with ponatinib due to a bacterial infection. Two patients switched to a different TKI due to a CVA after 4 and 24 months. Only 2 patients did not complete 8 cycles of hyper-CVAD due to death during induction n1 and proceeding to HCT after 3 cycles n1.jatsp jatspAs for similar Ph leukemias 3 chronic myeloid leukemia with lymphoid blast crisis CML-LBC 1 CML with mixed phenotype blast crisis CML-MPBC and 1 with mixed phenotype acute leukemia MPAL were treated with ponatinib hyper-CVAD. The MPAL patient achieved CMR within 55 days while the CML-MPBC and 2 CML-LBC patients achieved CMR after HCT. The third CML-LBC patient is in CR with ongoing treatment. After median follow-up of 25 months all 5 were alive and only the MPAL patient relapsed 28 months after starting treatment and 1 year after HCT.jatsp jatspConclusionjatsp jatspTo our knowledge this is the first report externally validating the efficacy and tolerability of ponatinib hyper-CVAD for Ph ALL. We also show the feasibility of using this regimen in patients with Ph CML-LBC CML-MPBC and MPAL. Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature our study supports existing data demonstrating that this regimen challenges both the designation of Ph ALL as a high-risk disease and the trend to transplant in CR1. Our findings support that ponatinib hyper-CVAD should be considered a standard of care for Ph ALL.jatsp jatspFigure 1 Figure 1.jatsp jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspKaesberg Incyte Speakers Bureau.

    "abstract": "All fields of biology have been greatly influenced by the generation of complete genome assemblies. This impact is most apparent with the findings and resulting applications from the Human Genome Project which has transformed biomedical science. Hoping for a similar transformation in agriculture a genome assembly was made first for chicken in 2004. More recently as the feasibility and economics of generating a genome assembly increased the number of species across all avian orders has increased dramatically e.g. 48 were produced and analyzed in the landmark paper which strongly suggests that the field of genomics will only grow in its ability to shape the future direction for all fields of avian biology.",

This study compared microsatellite analysis fatty acid profiling phenolic profiling and NMR fingerprinting for differentiating cultivars of California-style olives. Methods were tested on domestic Manzanilla domestic Sevillano imported Hojiblanca and imported Gordal olives. Microsatellites were successfully amplified in all cultivars except Hojiblanca and SevillanoGordal were found to be genetically-related possibly synonyms for the same genetic cultivar. Coupled with multivariate statistics fatty acid profiling differentiated the three genetically-distinct cultivars and NMR fingerprinting differentiated all four cultivars. Phenolic profile showed too much variability for effective discrimination. Future work includes expanding current models by size cultivars and type of table olive. We compared genetic and metabolite analyses for differentiating cultivars of processed olives. Two cultivars were identical for all SSRs tested and are possibly synonyms for the same cultivar. Fatty acid-profiling robustly differentiated genetically-distinct cultivars. Phenolic profiling was not a reliable method for differentiation due to processing effects. Untargeted NMR fingerprinting effectively differentiated all cultivars.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Age has been shown to be a primary determinant of survival following isolated traumatic brain injury TBI. We have previously reported that patients or 65 years who survived mild TBI have decreased functional outcome at 6 months compared with younger patients. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the effect of age on outcome at 1 year in all patients surviving isolated TBI. METHODS The Western Trauma Association multicenter prospective study included all patients sustaining isolated TBI defined as Abbreviated Injury Scale score for Head or 3 with an Abbreviated Injury Scale score in any other body area or 1. Outcome data included discharge disposition Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1 dead to 5 full recovery and modified Functional Independence Measure FIM score measuring feeding expression and locomotion 1 total dependence to 4 total independence for each component at discharge and 1 year. RESULTS In all 295 patients were enrolled with a follow-up of 82 resulting in 241 study patients. An additional five patients died from non-TBI causes and were excluded. The mean and median times for the last follow-up in the 236 remaining patients were 307 and 357 days respectively. Patients were divided into four age ranges 18 to 29 years n 66 30 to 44 years n 54 45 to 59 years n 50 and or 60 years n 65. More severe TBIs as measured by admitting Glasgow Coma Scale GCS were observed in the youngest group compared with all others but there were no differences in mean GCS between the remaining three groups. There were no differences in neurosurgical intervention between the groups. Age was a major determinant in the outcome at discharge and last follow-up. Patients over 60 years discharged with a GOS or 4 were less likely to improve at 1 year than all other groups 37 versus 63 to 85 p or 0.05. Patients between 18 and 29 years of age had the lowest mean Glasgow Outcome Scale and discharge FIM scores which correlated with the low admission GCS. Despite the increased severity of TBI this group had the best FIM score at 1 year. In contrast patients older than 60 years had the least improvement and had a significantly lower final FIM score at 1 year compared with all other groups. CONCLUSION Older patients following isolated TBI have poorer functional status at discharge and make less improvement at 1 year compared with all other patients. These worse outcomes occur despite what appears to be less severe TBI as measured by a higher GCS upon admission. Differences in outcome begin to appear even in patients between 45 and 59 years. Further investigations with more detailed outcome instruments are required to better understand the qualitative limitations of a patients recovery and to devise strategies to maximize functional improvement following TBI. Age is an exceedingly important parameter affecting recovery from isolated TBI.",

During 2021 a total of 20 wild carnivores and 57 lagomorphs were sampled and 39 argasid ticks belonging to two species were collected. All mammals and ticks were tested by molecular assays to detect Borrelia and Rickettsia infections. Nine ticks identified as Otobius megnini were collected from two coyotes Canis latrans and 30 Alveonasus cooleyi McIvor 1941 were collected from six bobcats Lynx rufus and one rabbit Sylvilagus auduboni. We detected Rickettsia spp. DNA in 21 of the 27 77.8 tested Av. cooleyi and none of the O. megnini. No ticks were PCR-positive for borreliae and all mammals were PCR-negative for both pathogen genera. Phylogenetic analysis based on gltA htrA and 16 S rRNA targets revealed that all rickettsiae from Av. cooleyi clustered with ancestral group rickettsiae likely representing a novel species of possibly endosymbiotic Rickettsia. The significance of Av. cooleyi and the newly identified Rickettsia sp. to the health of wildlife is unknown and further work is indicated to determine whether they may be relevant to public health or carnivore conservation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Isavuconazole administered as isavuconazonium sulfate ISAVUSULF is a broad-spectrum triazole agent for the treatment of invasive fungal disease. In phase 3 studies ISAVUSULF showed comparable efficacy to voriconazole and amphotericin B for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis IA and invasive mucormycosis IM respectively. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to determine all-cause mortality and safety outcomes among adults with IM andor IA non-fumigatus nf treated with ISAVUSULF or other antifungal therapies AFT. PATIENTS AND METHODS This multicentre non-interventional registry enrolled patients aged 18 years with IM or IA-nf who received systemic AFT from January 2016 to November 2018. Patients received primary ISAVUSULF non-primary ISAVUSULF or other AFT as monotherapy or combination therapy. The primary end point was all-cause mortality at Days 42 and 84 safety outcomes were adverse drug reactions ADRs to ISAVUSULF. RESULTS Of 204 patients enrolled 74 received primary ISAVUSULF 30 non-primary ISAVUSULF and 100 other AFT. All-cause mortality through Day 42 was numerically lower in the non-primary ISAVUSULF group than in the primary ISAVUSULF and other AFT groups for patients with IM 20.0 vs. 33.3 and 41.3 respectively or IA-nf 0 vs. 14.8 and 17.8 respectively. All-cause mortality tended to be lower with combination therapy than with monotherapy except for patients with IM receiving primary ISAVUSULF. Of 111 patients receiving ISAVUSULF 14 12.6 reported ADRs of whom three 2.7 developed serious ADRs. There were no drug-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the effectiveness and tolerability of ISAVUSULF in clinical practice. Further research is required to confirm the value of ISAVUSULF combination therapy over monotherapy.",

We previously discovered that the dietary fatty acid trans-10 cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid CLA stimulates estrogen-independent allometric growth and terminal end bud formation in ovariectomized mice. Given the similar phenotype induced by estrogen and CLA we investigated the shared andor divergent mechanisms underlying these changes. We confirmed MG growth induced by CLA is temporally distinct from that elicited by estrogen. We then used RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptome of the MG during similar proliferative and morphological states. Both estrogen and CLA affected the genes involved in proliferation. The transcriptome for estrogen-treated mice included canonical estrogen-induced genes including Pgr Areg and Foxa1. In contrast their expression was unchanged by CLA. However CLA but not estrogen altered expression of a unique set of inflammation-associated genes consistent with stromal changes. This CLA-altered signature included increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR pathway components consistent with the demonstration that CLA-induced MG growth is EGFR dependent. Our findings highlight a unique role for diet-induced inflammation that underlies estrogen-independent MG development.",

We sought to evaluate the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic status nSES and neighborhood archetype on early mortality and overall survival among patients with ALL and AML in California. We hypothesized that living in low SES neighborhoods will be associated with lower survival among young patients with acute leukemia. Methods Patients aged 0-39 years reported to the California Cancer Registry with a diagnosis of ALL or AML between 2006 and 2016 were included. Using a previously developed composite measure nSES quintiles were evaluated as the primary exposure of interest. Latent class analysis was used to generate neighborhood archetypes based on 39 social and built environment attributes at the block group level which were evaluated as an exploratory exposure. Patients were observed from diagnosis through last available follow up. Cox proportional hazards univariate models were used to estimate crude hazard ratios HR for early death within 60 days following diagnosis and overall survival OS. Results Of the 8761 patients included 6338 were diagnosed with ALL and 2423 were diagnosed with AML. Median follow up time was 3.2 and 2.1 years respectively. Minority raceethnicity older age ampgt19 years lack of insurance lack of chemotherapy and treatment at an adult center were associated with lower OS in univariate models. Patients in the lowest quintile of nSES had an increased risk of early mortality for both ALL HR 1.91 95 CI 1.06 3.47 and AML HR 2.01 95 CI 1.17 3.45 relative to the highest quintile of nSES. Likewise patients in the lowest quintile of nSES had lower OS for both ALL HR 2.10 95 CI 1.68 2.62 and AML HR 1.40 95 CI 1.12 1.76. A dose effect was observed with worse OS observed among quintiles 2-4 as well. In patients with ALL relative to the highest status neighborhood archetype all other neighborhood archetypes demonstrated lower OS with the most pronounced effects in inner city HR 2.35 95 CI 1.79 3.09 Hispanic small towns HR 2.33 95 CI 1.74 3.11 and mixed SES class suburban neighborhoods HR 2.27 95 CI 1.65 3.12. While there was a suggestion of differences by archetype among AML patients none reached statistical significance. Conclusions The substantial crude effect of neighborhood SES on early mortality and overall survival highlights an important disparity. Multivariable adjustment for other known predictors of survival is underway. When other aspects of the socialbuilt environment are incorporated the magnitude of the effect grows suggesting that nSES interacts with other neighborhood factors such as the racialethnic makeup. The greater effects of neighborhood among ALL patients relative to AML patients may be linked to the prolonged outpatient nature of the therapy and difficulties with treatment adherence among vulnerable populations.jatsp jatspCitation Format Lena E Winestone Juan Yang Daphne Y Lichtensztajn Renata Abrahao Theresa H Keegan Iona Cheng Scarlett L Gomez Salma Shariff-Marco.

    "abstract": "Natural language expresses events with varying granularities where coarse-grained events goals can be broken down into finer-grained event sequences steps. A critical yet overlooked aspect of understanding event processes is recognizing that not all step events hold equal importance toward the completion of a goal. In this paper we address this gap by examining the extent to which current models comprehend the essentiality of step events in relation to a goal event. Cognitive studies suggest that such capability enables machines to emulate human commonsense reasoning about preconditions and necessary efforts of everyday tasks. We contribute a high-quality corpus of goal step pairs gathered from the community guideline website WikiHow with steps manually annotated for their essentiality concerning the goal by experts. The high inter-annotator agreement demonstrates that humans possess a consistent understanding of event essentiality. However after evaluating multiple statistical and large-scale pre-trained language models we find that existing approaches considerably underperform compared to humans. This observation highlights the need for further exploration into this critical and challenging task.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis a major public health problem is becoming increasingly prevalent with the aging of the world population. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength which predisposes the individual to an increased risk of fractures of the hip spine and other skeletal sites. The clinical consequences and economic burden of this disease call for measures to assess individuals who are at high risk to allow for appropriate intervention. Many risk factors are associated with osteoporotic fracture including low peak bone mass hormonal factors the use of certain drugs eg glucocorticoids cigarette smoking low physical activity low intake of calcium and vitamin D race small body size and a personal or a family history of fracture. All of these factors should be taken into account when assessing the risk of fracture and determining whether further treatment is required. Because osteoporotic fracture risk is higher in older women than in older men all postmenopausal women should be evaluated for signs of osteoporosis during routine physical examinations. Radiologic laboratory assessments of bone mineral density generally should be reserved for patients at highest risk including all women over the age of 65 younger postmenopausal women with risk factors and all postmenopausal women with a history of fractures. The evaluation of biochemical markers of bone turnover has been useful in clinical research. However the predictive factor of these measurements is not defined clearly and these findings should not be used as a replacement for bone density testing. Together clinical assessment of osteoporotic risk factors and objective measures of bone mineral density can help to identify patients who will benefit from intervention and thus can potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporosis-associated fractures in this population.",

ARMDC subjects showed the greatest weakness 2.5 - 1.0 mean Manual Muscle Test MMT grade for all muscles combined and the only significant progression of loss of strength -0.59 MMT unit decline per decade. Strength loss in ADLO and PF types was about the same 3.7 - 0.7 and 4.0 - 0.7 grades respectively. Quantitative strength measurements in ADLO and PF types were more sensitive than MMTs showing losses of 30-40 strength in muscle groups with MMT grades of 4 or higher. All three types showed greater proximal and lower extremity weakness but usually no difference between flexor and extensor strength. There was a high percentage 44 of mild very slowly progressive scoliosis in ARMDC but spine deformity was unusual in ADLO and PF 11 LGS. Contractures were few slowly progressive and usually mild in severity in all types although more frequent in ARMDC. There also was a low frequency of severe restrictive lung disease in all types 10 but a high percentage of electrocardiogram abnormalities 62-73. The most common electrocardiogram abnormalities were increased RS ratio in V1 and infranodal conduction defects. Intellectual and cognitive functions were within normal limits. Mobility and extremity function reflected the strength differences between the ARMDC and other types of LGS. Eight-five percent of ARMDC individuals relied on a wheelchair for all or part of their mobility and all were unable to complete timed motor performance tests within the 99th percentile range for controls.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Laparoscopic approaches are possible for many pediatric surgical diseases including complex biliary disorders. The authors describe their early experience with laparoscopic procedures for biliary atresia and choledochal cysts. METHODS A retrospective review was performed with Institutional Review Board IRB approval of children undergoing laparoscopic Kasai portoenterostomy n 2 or laparoscopic excision of a choledochal cyst with Roux-en-y biliary reconstruction n 3. The authors report the operative technique for these procedures and present their initial results. RESULTS All procedures were performed with 4 to 5 trocars using 3- and 5-mm ports. Excision of the fibrous biliary remnant biliary atresia or of the cyst choledochal cysts was performed laparoscopically in all cases. The Roux-en-y limb was created through a 1-cm extension of the umbilical port site. Laparoscopic biliary reconstruction was performed successfully in 4 of 5 patients. In one child the proximal extent of the choledochal cyst was at the bifurcation of the hepatic duct and the biliary reconstruction was performed via an open incision with separate anastomoses of the right and left ducts. The gallbladder was used as a handle for retraction of the liver for portal visualization as in a cholecystectomy and was resected at the end of the procedure. All children with choledochal cysts have normal bilirubin values. One of 2 children who underwent laparoscopic Kasai has a normal postoperative bilirubin level whereas the other child did not drain bile and underwent a successful liver transplantation. Mean length of surgery was 338 minutes mean length of stay was 5.5 days. There were no significant postoperative complications. Cosmesis was excellent in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic approaches for children with biliary atresia and choledochal cysts are possible. Excellent visualization of the portal structures can be achieved laparoscopically with adequate retraction of the liver. Further follow-up is needed to determine broader application.",

We undertook surgical repair of this lesion in the neonatal period and report on our midterm results. METHODS Three neonates with tricuspid insufficiency and 1 infant with mitral insufficiency all due to papillary muscle or chordal rupture underwent surgical repair with artificial chordal replacement and a modification of the de Vega annuloplasty technique that allowed external adjustment of the annulus size under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS All patients recovered well from the operation. There have been no late deaths and no valve-related complications. On discharge all 3 patients had evidence of trace to mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation. At a median follow-up of 33 months range 7 to 50 123 patient-months all 4 patients are growing normally. Three patients have had no change in the degree of tricuspid or mitral regurgitation. One patient required reoperation at 54 months postoperatively for acute mitral insufficiency secondary to separation of an artificial chorda from the ventricular wall. CONCLUSIONS Surgical repair of critical neonatal tricuspid and mitral insufficiency associated with papillary muscle or chordal rupture is feasible and can result in good early and midterm results. Our modification of the De Vega annuloplasty technique with the ability to externally adjust the size of the annulus under echocardiographic guidance may improve the accuracy of the repair in the neonate.",

    "abstract": "Some lettuce cultivars are highly sensitive to triforine an inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis found in some commercial systemic fungicides. First symptoms of a sensitive reaction are usually observed within 24-48 h after treatment and include severe wilting necrosis and rapid plant death. We mapped a single dominant gene Tr that confers sensitivity of lettuce to triforine to linkage group 1 of the integrated genetic map of lettuce. The occurrence of sensitivity is not uniform across horticultural types of lettuce. While over 80 of green-romaine lettuce cultivars tested were sensitive most cultivars of all other lettuce types were insensitive to triforine. All accessions of wild Lactuca spp. were insensitive to triforine. Allelism tests using F1 and F2 progeny revealed that sensitive cultivars of all horticultural types likely carry the same Tr gene. The dominant allele for sensitivity found in cultivated lettuce probably had a monophyletic origin. The reaction to triforine can be used as a marker for detecting hybrids originating from a cross between phenotypically similar parents with different responses to triforine treatment. It also provides an indication of genotypes for which applications of triforine-containing fungicides are inappropriate. 2011 Springer ScienceBusiness Media B.V. outside the USA.",

METHODS We studied the database of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010. Basic variables metabolic diseases and bone density of different femoral areas were stratified into four subgroups according to different protein intake DPI that is 0.8 0.8-1.0 1.0-1.2 and 1.2 gkgday. RESULTS Significant differences were found among all lumbar area bone mineral density BMD and T-scores p 0.0001. There was an apparent trend between a decreasing BMD in the CKD groups with increasing DPI in all single lumbar spines L1 L2 L3 and L4 and all L spines L1-L4.

For osteoporosis reference0.8-1.0 gdaykg lower 0.8 gdaykg or higher DPI 1.2 gdaykg was associated with higher risks in the non-CKD group but not in the CKD group. CONCLUSIONS In the CKD group LPI for renal protection was safe without threatening L spine bone density and without causing a higher risk of osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "We present an extension of the Poisson-Boltzmann model in which the solute of interest is immersed in an assembly of self-orienting Langevin water dipoles anions cations and hydrophobic molecules all of variable densities. Interactions between charges are controlled by electrostatics while hydrophobic interactions are modeled with a Yukawa potential. We impose steric constraints by assuming that the system is represented on a cubic lattice. We also assume incompressibility i.e. all sites of the lattice are occupied. This model which we refer to as the Hydrophobic Dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann Langevin HDPBL model leads to a system of two equations whose solutions give the water dipole salt and hydrophobic molecule densities all of them in the presence of the others in a self-consistent way. We use those to study the organization of the ions cosolvent and solvent molecules around proteins. In particular peaks of densities are expected to reveal simultaneously the presence of compatible binding sites of different kinds on a protein. We have tested and validated the ability of HDPBL to detect pockets in proteins that bind to hydrophobic ligands polar ligands and charged small probes as well as to characterize the binding sites of lipids for membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Chemogenomics is a new strategy in in silico drug discovery where the ultimate goal is to understand molecular recognition for all molecules interacting with all proteins in the proteome. To study such cross interactions methods that can generalize over proteins that vary greatly in sequence structure and function are needed. We present a general quantitative approach to protein-ligand binding affinity prediction that spans the entire structural enzyme-ligand space. The model was trained on a data set composed of all available enzymes cocrystallized with druglike ligands taken from four publicly available interaction databases for which a crystal structure is available. Each enzyme was characterized by a set of local descriptors of protein structure that describe the binding site of the cocrystallized ligand. The ligands in the training set were described by traditional QSAR descriptors. To evaluate the model a comprehensive test set consisting of enzyme structures and ligands was manually curated. The test set contained enzyme-ligand complexes for which no crystal structures were available and thus the binding modes were unknown. The test set enzymes were therefore characterized by matching their entire structures to the local descriptor library constructed from the training set. Both the training and the test set contained enzyme-ligand complexes from all major enzyme classes and the enzymes spanned a large range of sequences and folds. The experimental binding affinities p K i ranged from 0.5 to 11.9 0.7-11.0 in the test set. The induced model predicted the binding affinities of the external test set enzyme-ligand complexes with an r 2 of 0.53 and an RMSEP of 1.5. This demonstrates that the use of local descriptors makes it possible to create rough predictive models that can generalize over a wide range of protein targets.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW To assess the efficacy benefits and limitations of available and emerging follow-up options for medication abortion. RECENT FINDINGS Medication abortion follow-up does not have to be a one size fits all protocol. From most to least invasive follow-up options include facility-based ultrasound laboratory-based repeat serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin hCG testing urine hCG testing high sensitivity low sensitivity and multilevel pregnancy tests self-assessment with symptom evaluation and no intervention. Provider or facility-dependent follow-up including ultrasound and serum testing are effective but have several limitations including needing to return to a facility and cost. Remote client-led follow-up options such as urine pregnancy testing and symptoms evaluation are well tolerated and effective for ruling out the rare outcome of ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion and have several advantages. Advantages include being inexpensive and flexible. However it is important to note that low-sensitivity and multilevel pregnancy tests are not available in all settings. In studies evaluating client-led follow-up with urine pregnancy tests ongoing pregnancies were identified over half the time with symptoms alone. SUMMARY Guidelines from several professional organizations have aligned with the evidence and no longer recommend routine office-based follow-up. To ensure care is person-centered providers should offer follow-up options that align with the comfort logistical ability and values of the client.",

    "abstract": "Almost all processes -- highly correlated weakly correlated or correlated not at all---exhibit statistical fluctuations. Often physical laws such as the Second Law of Thermodynamics address only typical realizations -- as highlighted by Shannons asymptotic equipartition property and as entailed by taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Indeed our interpretations of the functioning of macroscopic thermodynamic cycles are so focused. Using a recently derived Second Law for information processing we show that different subsets of fluctuations lead to distinct thermodynamic functioning in Maxwellian Demons. For example while typical realizations may operate as an engine -- converting thermal fluctuations to useful work -- even nearby fluctuations nontypical but probable realizations behave differently as Landauer erasers -- converting available stored energy to dissipate stored information. One concludes that ascribing a single unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system especially one on the nanoscale is at best misleading likely masking an array of simultaneous parallel thermodynamic transformations. This alters how we conceive of cellular processes engineering design and evolutionary adaptation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Mongolia is a country characterized by its vast distances and extreme climate. An underdeveloped medical transport infrastructure makes patient transfer from outlying regions dangerous. Providing pediatric surgical care locally is crucial to improve the lives of children in the countryside. This is the first structured assessment of nationwide pediatric surgical capacity. METHODS Operation rates were calculated using data from the Mongolian Center for Health Development and population data from the Mongolian Statistical Information Service. The Pediatric Personnel Infrastructure Procedures Equipment and Supplies PediPIPES survey tool was used to collect data at all survey sites. Descriptive data analyses were completed using Excel. Studies of association were completed using Stata. All reported percentages are of the hospitals outside of the capital n 21. RESULTS All provincial hospitals have general surgeons seven 33.3 of them have pediatric surgeons. One facility has no anesthesiologist. All facilities perform basic procedures and provide anesthesia. Four 19 can treat common congenital anomalies. All facilities have basic operating room equipment. Nine hospitals do not have pulse oximetry available. Twelve hospitals do not have pediatric surgical instruments always available. Pediatric supplies are lacking. CONCLUSIONS Provincial hospitals in Mongolia can perform basic procedures. However essential pediatric supplies are lacking. Consequently certain life-saving procedures are not available to children outside of the capital. Only a few improvements would be amendable to low-cost process improvement adjustment and the majority of needs require resource additions. Procedure equipment and supply availability should be further explored to develop a comprehensive nationwide pediatric surgical program.",

Marvdasht and wild barley Hordeum spontaneum. The cumulative emergence and plant height gain over time were modeled with the use of a logistic function. For a particular temperature regime the maximum percentage emergence Emax of wheat was higher than that of wild barley across all sowing depths. The maximum and minimum Emax values for both species occurred at 2015C and 2520C respectively.

The E50 of wild barley was greater than that of wheat for all temperature regimes with maximum differences observed at 2015C. The greatest maximum plant height Hmax was observed at the surface planting for both plants. The Hmax was reduced at temperatures either lower or higher than 2015C with a more notable reduction in wild barley. At all temperature regimes the time taken to reach 50 of the Hmax i.e. H50 increased linearly with the sowing depth but at higher temperatures the accelerated growth rate reduced the H50.

    "abstract": "jatspBackground Numerous studies have demonstrated superior survival for adolescents and young adults AYA with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL treated with pediatric-inspired as opposed to adult-type front-line ALL regimens. However very little is known regarding the potential impact of therapeutic regimen type on late effects and subsequent neoplasms SN in AYA ALL survivors. Using population-based data we describe associations between subsequent medical conditionsSN sociodemographics and ALL therapies including regimen type pediatric versus adult in a large cohort of AYA ALL survivors.jatsp jatspMethods The California Cancer Registry CCR linked with California hospitalization data was used to evaluate socio-demographics therapies and subsequent medical conditions late effects amongst AYAs 15-39 years diagnosed with ALL in California between 1995-2012 surviving a minimum of three years from diagnosis. The CCR was used to identify front-line therapeutic regimen receipt of cranial irradiation CRI and SN hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT and late effects were captured through hospitalization data. Late effects were categorized as cardiac hypertensive disease coronary artery disease heart failure neurologic stroke seizure endocrine thyroid disease diabetes ovariantesticular dysfunction other metabolic diseases respiratory asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pulmonary fibrosis renal chronic kidney disease hemodialysis kidney transplant liver chronic liver disease pancreatitis cirrhosis liver transplant and avascular necrosis AVN. The 10-year cumulative incidence CMI of developing each late effectSN was estimated accounting for death as a competing risk. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses MVA examined the impact of sociodemographic factors and therapies pediatric vs adult ALL regimen HCT CRI on the occurrence of each late effectSN. Front-line regimen type pediatric vs adult was highly correlated with receipt of HCT Pamplt0.001 thus the impact of front-line regimen was evaluated in separate MVA for those who did and did not receive HCT.jatsp jatspResults Of the 1069 survivors of AYA ALL median follow-up 8.2 years 44 were 15-19 years at diagnosis 32 were 20-29 years 24 were 30-39 years 62 were male and 50 were Hispanic. Thirty-nine percent resided in the lowest neighborhood socio-economic status SES tertile and 35 had public or no insurance. The majority 60 received an adult-type front-line ALL regimen 19 received CRI and 28 underwent HCT. Twenty-four SN occurred thyroid head and neck and breast cancers were most common. The 10-year CMI of endocrine disease 29 and cardiac disease 17 were strikingly high AVN 10 respiratory disease 6 liver disease 7 seizurestroke 4 renal disease 3 and SN 3 occurred with descending incidence. Multivariable analyses including the entire patient cohort demonstrated that public or no insurance vs privatemilitary insurance and receipt of HCT were independently associated with both late effects across organ systems and SN Table 1A. Raceethnicity sex and neighborhood SES were not associated with late effectsSN. In MVA limited to the 766 AYAs who did not receive HCT we continued to find a significant association between public and no insurance and all late effects including SN. Front-line regimen type was not significantly associated with any of the late effect categories nor was CRI Table 1B. Among the 303 AYAs who received HCT lower neighborhood SES was associated with higher risk of all late effectsSN considered.jatsp jatspConclusions This large population-based analysis is amongst the first to describe late effects and SN in survivors of AYA ALL. Public or no health insurance and receipt of HCT were independently associated with the development of late effects across organ systems and SN while front-line regimen type adult vs. pediatric among non-transplanted AYAs was not. The strong association between insurance type and late effects suggests that AYAs with public or no insurance may have reduced access to survivorship care following completion of ALL therapy. While additional follow-up is necessary to discern the full burden of late effects in survivors of AYA ALL these findings suggest significant ongoing healthcare needs in this cancer survivor population.jatsp jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspMuffly KITE Consultancy Pfizer Consultancy Adaptive Research Funding.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Trajectory generation for manipulators involves generating incremental updates of joint variables to achieve a desired endeffector motion. The Jacobian matrix maps incremental joint motion to incremental endeffector motion in a linear fashion and is typically used in manipulator trajectory generation algorithms. In the case of a redundant manipulator the Jacobian matrix is not square or invertible and therefore algorithms based on pseudoinverses and their variations are commonly used for trajectory generation. These methods either are computationally not efficient or do not utilize all the joints in motion generation and therefore do not completely exploit the redundancy of the manipulator. The method presented in this paper is a simple method that maximizes transmission of all joint variables onto a desired endeffector motion trajectory. The method is based on aligning the nullspace of an augmented Jacobian matrix with the path of the desired endeffector motion from which a linear combination of joints that projects fully onto the desired endeffector trajectory is obtained. In this manner all joints of the redundant manipulator are used to generate the endeffector trajectory accommodating the ability of each joint in terms of its motion transmission.",

Care at specialized cancer centers SCC Childrens Oncology Group affiliated andor National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center has been found to improve outcomes in patients with leukemia but studies have not considered location of care and outcomes in EWS and OS patients an ideal group to evaluate given their specialized multidisciplinary treatment needs. METHODS Patients hospitalized with primary EWS and OS 2000-2014 were identified using the California Cancer Registry linked with hospitalization data. Patients were divided into age groups 0-18 19-39 40 years and classified on whether they received all versus partnone of their inpatient treatment at a SCC within 1 year of diagnosis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors associated with survival. RESULTS There were 531 ES and 959 OS patients. Five-year overall survival was better for patients with EWS all 63 vs. partnone 42 and OS all 64 vs. partnone 47 who received all of their treatment at a SCC. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors receiving all inpatient cancer treatment at a SCC was associated with superior overall survival EWS HR 0.49 CI 0.37-0.67 OS HR 0.78 CI 0.63-0.97. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that treatment for EWS and OS at a SCC is associated with significantly improved survival even after adjustment for known prognostic factors. The superior survival among those treated at SCCs may be due to having greater access to clinical trials and services at SCCs.",

    "abstract": "DUOX1 and DUOX2 are members of the NADPH oxidase family that are specifically regulated to produce hydrogen peroxide in epithelia of the thyroid gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract. The determinants of DUOX1 or DUOX2 expression in various tissues have not been established. Using respiratory tract epithelial cells as a model we investigated changes in DUOX mRNA and protein expression during the first 10 days of differentiation. By comparing a respiratory tract cell line HBE1 with primary tracheobronchial epithelial TBE cells we determined that DUOX2 was significantly expressed only in cell conditions that included all-trans retinoic acid ATRA. In HBE1 cells DUOX2 mRNA increased 6-fold after ATRA treatment. Similarly ATRA induced a 19-fold increase in DUOX2 mRNA expression in primary TBE cells with parallel increases in DUOX protein and DUOX-mediated H2O2 production as well. In addition DUOX2 induction by rhinovirus required the presence of ATRA. ATRA had no effect on DUOX1 expression for all the conditions studied. Our data indicate that for respiratory epithelial cells ATRA is important in the regulation of DUOX2 expression function and rhinovirus-mediated DUOX2 inducibility.",

Adults of rolledleaf hispine beetles Chrysomelidae Coleoptera spend their lives in the scrolls formed by immature leaves of Heliconia Heliconiaceae Monocotyledonae in Tropical America. As many as eight hispine species can intermingle in the host scrolls at a single site. Scrolls of single host species are invariably occupied by adults of more than one hispine species and as many as five species can simultaneously occupy one scroll. 2. I made virgin scrolls which had never contained any insects by growing leaves under the cover of plastic bags. 3. Thirtyseven combinations of single hispine and Heliconia species were experimentally created in the virgin scrolls at two sites and in two seasons in Costa Rica. Combinations included all abundant host species at the sites. 4. All beetles left all leaves of the twentyeight unnatural beetlehost combinations within 24 h. On the other hand none of the nine natural combinations was completely abandoned within the experimental period. 5. Thus host specificity is not broader in the absence of similar hispine species that might be competitors and interspecies competition does not affect this obvious aspect of resource utilization for these phytophagous insects.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To identify pathogenic mutations responsible for retinal dystrophy in three consanguineous Pakistani families. METHODS A thorough ophthalmic examination including fundus examination and electroretinography was performed and blood samples were collected from all participating members. Genomic DNA was extracted and genome-wide linkage andor exclusion analyses were completed with fluorescently labeled short tandem repeat microsatellite markers. Two-point Lod scores were calculated and coding exons along with exon-intron boundaries of RPE65 gene were sequenced bidirectionally. RESULTS Ophthalmic examinations of the patients affected in all three families suggested retinal dystrophy with an early most probably congenital onset. Genome-wide linkage andor exclusion analyses localized the critical interval in all three families to chromosome 1p31 harboring RPE65. Bidirectional sequencing of RPE65 identified a splice acceptor site variation in intron 2 c.95-1GA a single base substitution in exon 3 c.179TC and a single base deletion in exon 5 c.361delT in the three families respectively. All three variations segregated with the disease phenotype in their respective families and were absent from ethnically matched control chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS These results strongly suggest that causal mutations in RPE65 are responsible for retinal dystrophy in the affected individuals of these consanguineous Pakistani families.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Outcomes of surgical resident training are under scrutiny with the changing milieu of surgical education. Few have investigated the effect of surgical resident involvement SRI on operative parameters. Examining 7 common general surgery procedures we evaluated the effect of SRI on perioperative morbidity and mortality and operative time OpT. STUDY DESIGN The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database 2005 to 2007 was used to identify 7 cases of nonemergent operations. Cases with simultaneous procedures were excluded. Logistic regression was performed across all procedures and within each procedure incorporating SRI OpT and risk-stratifying American College of Surgery National Surgical Quality Improvement Program morbidity and mortality probability scores which incorporate multiple prognostic individual patient factors. Procedure-specific SRI-stratified OpTs were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS A total of 71.3 of the 37907 cases had SRI. Absolute 30-day morbidity for all cases with SRI and without SRI were 3.0 and 1.0 respectively p 0.001 absolute 30-day mortality for all cases with SRI and without SRI were 0.1 and 0.08 respectively p 0.001. After multivariate analysis by specific procedure SRI was not associated with increased morbidity but was associated with decreased mortality during open right colectomy odds ratio 0.32 p 0.01. Across all procedures SRI was associated with increased morbidity odds ratio 1.14 p 0.048 but decreased mortality odds ratio 0.42 p 0.001. Mean OpT for all procedures was consistently lower for cases without SRI. CONCLUSIONS SRI has a measurable impact on both 30-day morbidity and mortality and OpT. These data have implications to the impact associated with surgical graduate medical education. Further studies to identify causes of patient morbidity and prevention strategies in surgical teaching environments are warranted.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality among older women with hip osteoarthritis OA and to identify mediators in the causal pathway. METHODS Data were from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures a US population-based cohort study of 9704 white women age 65 years. The analytic sample included women with hip radiographs at baseline n 7889 and year 8 n 5749. Mortality was confirmed through October 2013 by death certificates and hospital discharge summaries. Radiographic hip OA RHOA was defined as a Croft grade of 2 in at least 1 hip definite joint space narrowing or osteophytes plus 1 other radiographic feature. RESULTS The mean SD followup time was 16.1 6.2 years. The baseline and year 8 prevalence of RHOA were 8.0 and 11.0 respectively. The cumulative incidence proportion of deaths during the study period was 67.7 for all-cause mortality 26.3 for cardiovascular disease CVD mortality 11.7 for cancer mortality 1.9 for gastrointestinal disease mortality and 27.8 for all other mortality causes. RHOA was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality hazard ratio 1.14 95 confidence interval 1.05-1.24 and CVD mortality hazard ratio 1.24 95 confidence interval 1.09-1.41 adjusted for age body mass index education smoking health status diabetes and stroke. These associations were partially explained by the mediating variable of physical function. CONCLUSION RHOA was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality among older white women followed up for 16 years. Dissemination of evidence-based physical activity and self-management interventions for hip OA in community and clinical settings can improve physical function and might also contribute to lower mortality.",

    "abstract": "AIM Coinfecting bacterial pathogens are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in influenza. However there remains a paucity of literature on the magnitude of coinfection in influenza patients. METHOD A systematic search of MeSH Cochrane Library Web of Science SCOPUS EMBASE and PubMed was performed. Studies of humans in which all individuals had laboratory confirmed influenza and all individuals were tested for an array of common bacterial species met inclusion criteria. RESULTS Twenty-seven studies including 3215 participants met all inclusion criteria. Common etiologies were defined from a subset of eight articles. There was high heterogeneity in the results I2 95 with reported coinfection rates ranging from 2 to 65. Although only a subset of papers were responsible for observed heterogeneity subanalyses and meta-regression analysis found no study characteristic that was significantly associated with coinfection. The most common coinfecting species were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus which accounted for 35 95 CI 14-56 and 28 95 CI 16-40 of infections respectively a wide range of other pathogens caused the remaining infections. An assessment of bias suggested that lack of small-study publications may have biased the results. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of coinfection in the published studies included in this review suggests that although providers should consider possible bacterial coinfection in all patients hospitalized with influenza they should not assume all patients are coinfected and be sure to properly treat underlying viral processes. Further high heterogeneity suggests additional large-scale studies are needed to better understand the etiology of influenza bacterial coinfection.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that ionizing radiation can enhance immune responses to tumors. Advances in radiation delivery techniques allow hypofractionated delivery of conformal radiotherapy. Hypofractionation or other modifications of standard fractionation may improve radiations ability to promote immune responses to tumors. Other novel delivery options may also affect immune responses including T-cell activation and tumor-antigen presentation changes. However there is limited understanding of the immunological impact of hypofractionated and unique multifractionated radiotherapy regimens as these observations are relatively recent. Hence these differences in radiotherapy fractionation result in distinct immune-modulatory effects. Radiation oncologists and immunologists convened a virtual consensus discussion to identify current deficiencies challenges pitfalls and critical gaps when combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy and making recommendations to the field and advise National Cancer Institute on new directions and initiatives that will help further development of these two fields.This commentary aims to raise the awareness of this complexity so that the need to study radiation dose fractionation type and volume is understood and valued by the immuno-oncology research community. Divergence of approaches and findings between preclinical studies and clinical trials highlights the need for evaluating the design of future clinical studies with particular emphasis on radiation dose and fractionation immune biomarkers and selecting appropriate end points for combination radiationimmune modulator trials recognizing that direct effect on the tumor and potential abscopal effect may well be different. Similarly preclinical studies should be designed as much as possible to model the intended clinical setting. This article describes a conceptual framework for testing different radiation therapy regimens as separate models of how radiation itself functions as an immunomodulatory drug to provide alternatives to the widely adopted one-size-fits-all strategy of frequently used 8 Gy3 regimens immunomodulation.",

    "abstract": "The goal of our project is to develop a unique ligand-conjugated nanoparticle NP therapy against childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL. LLP2A discovered by Dr. Kit Lam is a high-affinity and high-specificity peptidomimetic ligand against an activated 41 integrin. Our study using 11 fresh primary ALL samples 10 precursor B ALL and 1 T ALL showed that childhood ALL cells expressed activated 41 integrin and bound to LLP2A. Normal hematopoietic cells such as activated lymphocytes and monocytes expressed activated 41 integrin however normal hematopoietic stem cells showed low expression of 41 integrin. Therefore we believe that LLP2A can be used as a targeted therapy for childhood ALL. The Lam lab has developed novel telodendrimer-based nanoparticles NPs which can carry drugs efficiently. We have also developed a human leukemia mouse model using immunodeficient NODSCIDIL2R null mice engrafted with primary childhood ALL cells from our patients. LLP2A-conjugated NPs will be evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using primary leukemia cells and this mouse model. NPs will be loaded first with DiD near infra-red dye and then with the chemotherapeutic agents daunorubicin or vincristine. Both drugs are mainstays of current chemotherapy for childhood ALL. Targeting properties of LLP2A-conjugated NPs will be evaluated by fluorescent microscopy flow cytometry MTS assay and mouse survival after treatment. We expect that LLP2A-conjugated NPs will be preferentially delivered and endocytosed to leukemia cells as an effective targeted therapy. 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers SPIE.",

In this study residual stress microstructure and fatigue crack growth rate FCGR results were compared in AM Type 304L stainless steel produced by laser powder bed fusion PBF on different systems using similar process parameters. Residual stress measured in the build direction was remarkably consistent in all PBF builds. Backscatter electron large area images revealed similar grain morphologies in the different builds all of which exhibited elongated grains in the build direction and inhomogeneous grain size and shape. Fatigue crack growth investigated both parallel and perpendicular to the build direction revealed higher measured crack growth rates in the near-threshold regime in both orientations of the PBF material compared to wrought material. The difference in near-threshold fatigue crack growth rates is attributed primarily to the influence of processing-induced residual stress quantified by the residual stress intensity factor. These values revealed consistent FCGR effects in each orientation across specimens extracted from different builds and were then used to reveal a convergence of the corrected FCGR data of all PBF and wrought specimens.",

    "abstract": "Patients with BCR-ABL1 positive hematologic malignancies and Philadelphia-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL are potential candidates for targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKI. Before TKIs patients with B-ALL had a much worse prognosis and current treatments with targeted TKI therapy have improved outcomes. Thus the detection of BCR-ABL1 is crucial and a false negative BCR-ABL1 result may adversely affect patient care. We report a case of a 76-year-old male with a new diagnosis of B-ALL who was initially found to be BCR-ABL1 negative by quantitative polymerase chain reaction PCR. A concurrent qualitative PCR was performed which detected a positive BCR-ABL1 result that was confirmed by a next generation sequencing NGS based assay and identified as the rare fusion variant e1a3 of p190BCR-ABL. Based on this result the patient was placed on dasatinib as a targeted therapy. In the era of molecular diagnostic medicine and targeted therapy it is essential to have an understanding of the limitations of molecular assays and to follow a comprehensive diagnostic approach in order to detect common abnormalities and rare variants. Incorporating NGS methods in an algorithmic manner into the standard diagnostic PCR-based approach for BCR-ABL1 will aid in minimizing false negative results.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has looked at extending the k-Means algorithm to incorporate background information in the form of instance level must-link and cannot-link constraints. We introduce two ways of specifying additional background information in the form of and constraints that operate on all instances but which can be interpreted as conjunctions or disjunctions of instance level constraints and hence are easy to implement. We present complexity results for the feasibility of clustering under each type of constraint individually and several types together. A key finding is that determining whether there is a feasible solution satisfying all constraints is in general NP-complete. Thus an iterative algorithm such as k-Means should not try to find a feasible partitioning at each iteration. This motivates our derivation of a new version of the k-Means algorithm that minimizes the constrained vector quantization error but at each iteration does not attempt to satisfy all constraints. Using standard UCI datasets we find that using constraints improves accuracy as others have reported but we also show that our algorithm reduces the number of iterations until convergence. Finally we illustrate these benefits and our new constraint types on a complex real world object identification problem using the infra-red detector on an Aibo robot. Copyright by SIAM.",

The number of severe injuries caused by ATV crashes on farms which stood at 25 children in 2019 is expected to rise due to increased ATV sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing research into childrens injuries has explored physical capabilities like anthropometry strength and visual acuity. Yet studies assessing youths physical ability to operate ATVs remain limited. This study tests the hypothesis that diminished vision field in young ATV operators raises crash risks. METHODS This study used SAMMIECAD digital human modeling system to simulate and compare the field of vision of youth and adult ATV operators. The simulations incorporated 3-D mockups of ATVs humans sprayer tanks windshields and obstacles. Ten utility ATVs and children of both genders across nine ages 8-16 and three height percentiles 5th 50th 95th were evaluated. RESULTS Simulations showed that young ATV operators generally have a more restricted field of vision than adults particularly those aged 6-11 years. DISCUSSION Visual limitations hinder riders ability to see ATV controls potentially leading to vehicle control loss. Moreover they impair environmental perception during riding compromising youths ATV operation abilities and increasing crash risks. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS These findings offer crucial data in support of modifying ATV safety guidelines. Additionally they can guide youth occupational health professionals in preventing ATV-related incidents in agricultural settings.",

All Gavien groups grew rubber as a cash crop as well as food crops. Food intake information was collected by 24-hour recalls and food frequency questionnaires. Sago and fresh fish consumption decreased for hunter-gatherers in Gavien but garden crop consumption increased. Purchased foods such as rice and tinned fish became important energy and protein sources for all groups in Gavien. In comparison with intakes in the home areas mothers and children in Gavien had higher intakes of most nutrients except for those from the Grass Country who had lower protein and niacin intakes after resettlement. Dietary quality improved with resettlement because the traditional diet in lowland Papua New Guinea is monotonous and staple foods are low in nutrient density. Therefore the addition of purchased foods had a beneficial rather than detrimental effect. 1990 Taylor Francis Group LLC. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Fenretinide is significantly more effective in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells than all-trans retinoic acid ATRA. The current study uses a genome-wide approach to understand the differential role fenretinide and ATRA have in inducing apoptosis in Huh7 cells. Fenretinide and ATRA-induced gene expressions and DNA bindings were profiled using microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-RXR antibody. The data showed that fenretinide was not a strong transcription regulator. Fenretinide only changed the expressions of 1 093 genes approximately three times less than the number of genes regulated by ATRA 2 811. Biological function annotation demonstrated that both fenretinide and ATRA participated in pathways that determine cell fate and metabolic processes. However fenretinide specifically induced FasTNF-mediated apoptosis by increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic genes i.e. DEDD2 CASP8 CASP4 and HSPA1AB whereas ATRA induced the expression of BIRC3 and TNFAIP3 which inhibit apoptosis by interacting with TRAF2. In addition fenretinide inhibited the expression of the genes involved in RASRAFERK-mediated survival pathway. In contrast ATRA increased the expression of SOSC2 BRAF MEK and ERK genes. Most genes regulated by fenretinide and ATRA were bound by RXR suggesting a direct effect. This study revealed that by regulating fewer genes the effects of fenretinide become more specific and thus has fewer side effects than ATRA. The data also suggested that fenretinide induces apoptosis via death receptor effector and by inhibiting the RASRAFERK pathway. It provides insight on how retinoid efficacy can be improved and how side effects in cancer therapy can be reduced.",

    "abstract": "Pokmon Go is a new game that encourages players to venture outdoors and interact with others in the pursuit of virtual Pokmon characters. With more time spent outdoors overall and in sometimes large congregations Pokmon Go players could inadvertently elevate their risk of exposure to mosquito-borne diseases when playing in certain areas at certain times of year. Here we make an initial assessment of the possible scope of this concern in the continental United States which experiences its highest seasonal transmission of West Nile Zika and other viruses during summer and early fall. In particular we propose that the times of day when many disease-relevant mosquito species are most likely to engage in blood feeding coincide with times of day when Pokmon Go activity is likely to be high and we note that locations serving as hubs of Pokmon Go activity may in some cases overlap with areas where these mosquitoes are actively engaged in blood feeding. Although the risk of mosquito-borne diseases in the continental U.S. is low overall and is unlikely to be impacted significantly by Pokmon Go it is nonetheless important for Pokmon Go players and others who spend time outdoors engaging in activities such as barbecues and gardening to be aware of these ongoing risks and to take appropriate preventative measures in light of the potential for outdoor activity to modify individual-level risk of exposure. As Pokmon Go and other augmented reality games become available in other parts of the world similar risks should be assessed in a manner that is consistent with the local epidemiology of mosquito-borne diseases in those areas.",

PROCEDURE The CD phenotype was determined by videofluoroscopy and dogs were classified as affected if the upper esophageal sphincter UES did not open if there were morphologic abnormalities of the UES or if opening of the UES was delayed for or 6 videofluoroscopic frames 0.2 seconds after closure of the epiglottis. All survey radiographic and videofluoroscopic studies were reviewed by the same radiologist. RESULTS Of the 117 dogs 47 males and 70 females with a CD phenotype determined via videofluoroscopy 21 dogs 18.0 had abnormalities of the UES affected. Of these 21 dogs 9 were males 19.1 of all males and 12 were females 17.1 of all females. The heritability of CD in a threshold model was estimated as 0.61 which established that CD could be passed from parent to offspring. Results of complex segregation analysis suggested that a single recessive allele of large effect contributed to the expression of this disease in Golden Retrievers.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This article describes a common methodology and measurement technique encompassing both conventional helical and axial CT scanning using phantom translation and cone beam or narrow fan beam CT scans about a stationary phantom. Cone beam CT systems having beam widths along the z-axis wide enough to cover a significant anatomical length 50-160 mm in a single axial rotation e.g. in cardiac CT are rapidly proliferating in the clinic referred to herein as stationary cone beam CT SCBCT. The integral format of the CTDI paradigm is not appropriate for a stationary phantom and is not useful for predicting the dose in SCBCT nor for perfusion studies or CT fluoroscopy. Likewise the pencil chamber has limited utility in this domain even one of extended length. METHODS By demonstrating both experimentally and theoretically the match between the dose distribution fz for a wide cone beam and that due to an axial scan series Dz it is shown that the dose on the central ray of the cone beam f0 is both spatially colocated and numerically equal to the dose predicted by CTDI for the axial series and thus f0 is the logical and unique choice for a SCBCT dose-descriptor consistent with the CTDI-based dose of conventional CT. This dose f0 can be readily measured using a conventional short ionization chamber. Additionally Monte Carlo simulations of Boone J. M.

    "abstract": "Most great ape genetic variation remains uncharacterized however its study is critical for understanding population history recombination selection and susceptibility to disease. Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild- and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species signals of gene flow and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct groups Nigeria-Cameroonwestern and centraleastern populations. We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at or close to genes in almost all species. We discover and assign 1982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape lineages determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny. This comprehensive catalogue of great ape genome diversity provides a framework for understanding evolution and a resource for more effective management of wild and captive great ape populations.",

Preplant soil fumigation treatments of methyl bromide plus chloropicrin MBPic iodomethane plus chloropicrin IMPic 13-dichloropropene plus chloropicrin mixture followed by fb dazomet chloropicrin fb dazomet and a nonfumigated control were evaluated at three California strawberry runner plant nurseries through two production cycles. Fumigant efficacy was measured by weed seed viability bioassays weed density counts and time of handweeding. Generally all alternative fumigant treatments controlled weeds at levels comparable to MBPic. All fumigant treatments including MBPic killed more than 95 of common knotweed common purslane common chickweed and strawberry seed. Iodomethane chloropicrin fb dazomet and 13-dichloropropene plus chloropicrin mixture fb dazomet controlled carpetweed common lambsquarters hairy nightshade palmer amaranth and prostrate spurge. Handweeding inputs for all fumigants were similar to MBPic at three of four locations. The exception was at the low-elevation nursery in 2000 where handweeding times with MBPic were lower than for IMPic. Treatment and handweeding costs were calculated. The handweeding costs for all treatments were approximately the same. However the higher iodomethane material cost resulted in a substantially higher treatment cost.",

    "abstract": "We study a novel geometric expansion for scattering amplitudes in the planar sector of N 4 super Yang-Mills theory in the context of the Amplituhedron which reproduces the all-loop integrand as a canonical differential form on the positive geometry. In a paper by Arkani-Hamed Henn and one of the authors it was shown that this result can be recast in terms of negative geometries with a certain hierarchy of loops closed cycles in the space of loop momenta represented by lines in momentum twistor space. One can then calculate an all-loop order result in the approximation where only tree graphs in the space of all loops are considered. Furthermore using differential equation methods it is possible to calculate and resum integrated expressions and obtain strong coupling results. In this paper we provide a more general framework for the loops of loops expansion and outline a powerful method for the determination of differential forms for higher-order geometries. We solve the problem completely for graphs with one internal cycle but the method can be used more generally for other geometries.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Virtually all existing evidence linking access to firearms to elevated risks of mortality and morbidity comes from ecological and case-control studies. To improve understanding of the health risks and benefits of firearm ownership we launched a cohort study the Longitudinal Study of Handgun Ownership and Transfer LongSHOT. METHODS Using probabilistic matching techniques we linked three sources of individual-level state-wide data in California official voter registration records an archive of lawful handgun transactions and all-cause mortality data. There were nearly 28.8 million unique voter registrants 5.5 million handgun transfers and 3.1 million deaths during the study period 18 October 2004 to 31 December 2016. The linkage relied on several identifying variables first middle and last names date of birth sex residential address that were available in all three data sets deploying them in a series of bespoke algorithms. RESULTS Assembly of the LongSHOT cohort commenced in January 2016 and was completed in March 2019. Approximately three-quarters of matches identified were exact matches on all link variables. The cohort consists of 28.8 million adult residents of California followed for up to 12.2 years. A total of 1.2 million cohort members purchased at least one handgun during the study period and 1.6 million died. CONCLUSIONS Three steps taken early may be particularly useful in enhancing the efficiency of large-scale data linkage thorough data cleaning assessment of the suitability of off-the-shelf data linkage packages relative to bespoke coding and careful consideration of the minimum sample size and matching precision needed to support rigorous investigation of the study questions.",

    "abstract": "With the increased use of time series data in human research ranging from ecological momentary assessments to data passively obtained researchers can explore dynamic processes more than ever before. An important question researchers must ask themselves is do I think all individuals have similar processes If not how different and in what ways Dr. Peter Molenaars work set the foundation to answer these questions by providing insight into individual-level analysis for processes that are assumed to differ across individuals in at least some aspects. Currently such assumptions do not have a clear taxonomy regarding the degree of homogeneity in the patterns of relations among variables and the corresponding parameter values. This paper provides the language with which researchers can discuss assumptions inherent in their analyses. We define strict homogeneity as the assumption that all individuals have an identical pattern of relations as well as parameter values pattern homogeneity assumes the same pattern of relations but parameter values can differ weak homogeneity assumes there are some but not all generalizable aspects of the process and no homogeneity explicitly assumes no population-level similarities in dynamic processes across individuals. We demonstrate these assumptions with an empirical data set of daily emotions in couples.",

    "abstract": "Pacific salmonids cold-water fishes native to the northern hemisphere span a massive geographic range 33 latitude and are exposed to a wide variety of environmental conditions regionally and temporally. California is home to the greatest concentration of at-risk anadromous salmonids and warming river temperatures pose both current and future threats to numerous populations. Thermal standards for management of California populations are currently based on guidelines for multiple salmonid species and from populations across the Pacific Coast. However a growing body of literature suggests that salmonid populations exhibit population-specific thermal requirements. Furthermore in California salmonid populations regularly encounter temperatures that exceed current thermal standards based upon performance of outside populations. This review focuses on Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha providing evidence for interpopulation variation in thermal performance across life stages and explores the drivers of variation. To describe the formation of interpopulation variation we define fundamental and ecological thermal physiologies. Fundamental thermal physiology is the composite of intrinsic physiological traits and abiotic factors that define a species thermal window. Ecological and environmental interactions constrain this fundamental thermal physiology yielding an ecological thermal physiology. Thermal physiology viewed through this lens provides researchers and managers avenues for salmonid research and conservation at the population scale. A more nuanced approach to west-coast salmonid conservation will be required to protect the most at-risk and vulnerable populations. Successful salmonid management must incorporate population-specific traits and present and future watershed conditions.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Various methods have been described to create a functional neovagina with feminizing male-to-female gender affirming surgery. Intestinal vaginoplasty using ileal or colon segments confers natural mucus production and greater canal depth with primary vaginoplasty. In this work we describe an alternative approach to primary and salvage vaginoplasty using right colon. We focus on relative advantages compared to use of other bowel segments and we review patient outcomes. METHODS Transgender women who had previously undergone primary vaginoplasty underwent laparoscopic right colon vaginoplasty at our center between 122017 and 72019. Demographic medical outcome and satisfaction data was collected and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-two consecutive transgender women patients underwent laparoscopic right colon vaginoplasty. Mean age was 39.3 years. There were two intraoperative complications1 injury of the ileocolic pedicle and 1 minor bladder injury. Four of 22 patients 18.2 had short-term complications 30 days 3 had postoperative ileussmall bowel obstruction and 1 had intra-abdominal hemorrhage. All were managed conservatively. Six of 22 patients 27.3 experienced a total of 14 long-term complications 30 days 1 developed Crohns not involving the neovagina 1 developed late small bowel obstruction SBO managed conservatively 5 developed neovagina prolapse 4 developed stenosis 2 at the vaginal introitus and 2 had extrinsic obstruction at the recto-vaginal junction all underwent successful laparoscopic surgical correction and 3 were diagnosed with diversion neovaginitis all treated conservatively. All complications were successfully treated with conservative andor surgical intervention. All 100 patients reported satisfaction with neovagina function and appearance. CONCLUSION This is the only outcomes series of transgender women patients who have undergone right colon vaginoplasty to date. Our study finding suggests that laparoscopic right colon for primary or salvage vaginoplasty has several important advantages over use of Sigmoid colon or Ileum and is a reliable technique whose complications can be managed successfully with favorable satisfactory long-term outcomes.",

Patients with VTE prior to or at the time of malignancy diagnosis or who were not treated with chemotherapy were excluded. We determined the cumulative incidence of first UE DVT adjusted for the competing risk of death. We also examined the cumulative incidence of subsequent VTE UE DVT lower extremity deep vein thrombosis LE DVT and pulmonary embolism PE and major bleeding after incident UE DVT.jatsp jatspUsing Cox proportional hazards regression models stratified by tumor type and adjusted for other prognostic covariates including sex raceethnicity age at diagnosis neighborhood sociodemographic status and central venous catheter CVC placement we identified risk factors for development of incident UE DVT the effect of incident UE DVT on PE andor LE DVT development and impact of incident UE DVT on cancer specific survival. The association of CVC placement with incident UE DVT was not assessed in acute leukemia patients as all who undergo treatment were assumed to have a CVC.

    "abstract": "With the goal of developing a total-body small-animal PET system with a high spatial resolution of 0.5 mm and a high sensitivity 10 for mouserat studies we simulated four scanners using the graphical processing unit-based Monte Carlo simulation package gPET and compared their performance in terms of spatial resolution and sensitivity. We also investigated the effect of depth-of-interaction DOI resolution on the spatial resolution. All the scanners are built upon 128 DOI encoding dual-ended readout detectors with lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate LYSO arrays arranged in 8 detector rings. The solid angle coverages of the four scanners are all 0.85 steradians. Each LYSO element has a cross-section of 0.44 0.44 mm2 and the pitch size of the LYSO arrays are all 0.5 mm. The four scanners can be divided into two groups 1 H2RS110-C10 and H2RS110-C20 with 40 40 LYSO arrays a ring diameter of 110 mm and axial length of 167 mm and 2 H2RS160-C10 and H2RS160-C20 with 60 60 LYSO arrays a diameter of 160 mm and axial length of 254 mm. C10 and C20 denote the crystal thickness of 10 and 20 mm respectively. The simulation results show that all scanners have a spatial resolution better than 0.5 mm at the center of the field-of-view FOV. The radial resolution strongly depends on the DOI resolution and radial offset but not the axial resolution and tangential resolution. Comparing the C10 and C20 designs the former provides better resolution especially at positions away from the center of the FOV whereas the latter has 2 higher sensitivity 10 versus 20. This simulation study provides evidence that the 110 mm systems are a good choice for total-body mouse studies at a lower cost whereas the 160 mm systems are suited for both total-body mouse and rat studies.",

    "abstract": "Legacy IP routing restricts the efficacy of traffic engineering solutions. This restriction stems from the constraint that traffic at a node must be uniformly split across all next-hop nodes corresponding to equal cost shortest path to a destination. Proposals that alleviate this constraint either completely overhaul legacy IP routing or introduce complex control andor forwarding plane components. This additional complexity departs from the elegant simplicity of legacy routing protocols where statically optimized link weights embed all traffic engineering semantics. We present Interface Split Routing ISR which retains the basic forwarding and control mechanism of legacy IP routing. Furthermore a set of link weights embed all traffic engineering semantics in ISR. However ISR makes possible finer-grained traffic engineering by configuring independent sets of next-hops to a destination at each incoming interface. This lends itself well to modern router architectures where each incoming interface has its own forwarding table. Consequently at the aggregated node level traffic to a particular destination may be non-uniformly distributed across next-hop nodes. Hence ISR allows additional flexibility in routing traffic as compared to default IP routing while retaining its simplicity. We conduct simulation studies on representative ISP topologies to compare ISR with traditional link-weight-optimized routing. ISR reduces the difference between optimal routing and weight-optimized routing by 50. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

These dissociations have supported inferences about the organization of cognitive processes e.g. separable knowledge and action systems and their development e.g. knowledge systems develop before action systems. The current study tested the basis for knowledge-action dissociations in a card-sorting task in which children typically correctly answer questions about sorting rules while sorting cards incorrectly. When questions and sorting measures were more closely equated for the amount of conflict that needed to be resolved for a correct response children showed no systematic dissociation between knowledge and action.

Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006 Aina OH et al. Mol. Pharm. 2007. Using this method LLP2A a ligand against activated a4b1 integrin was discovered that targets malignant lymphoma with high affinity and specificity Peng L et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2008. We tested whether childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL cells expressed activated a4b1 integrin and bound to LLP2A using primary leukemia cells and leukemia cells engrafted in NODSCIDIL2Rg null NSG mice. Expression of activated a4b1 integrin was observed in three primary leukemia samples 1 T-ALL 1 precursor B preB ALL and 1 relapsed preB ALL by the rainbow beads color-coded polystyrene bead mixture displaying unique ligands against known receptors such as a4b1 a3b1 avb3 a5b1 integrins Luo J et al. J. Comb. Chem. 2008. To quantify activated a4b1 integrin expression primary leukemia cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using biotinylated LLP2Astreptavidin-PE. Nine samples 7 preB ALL and 2 relapsed preB ALL were analyzed. All samples except for one relapsed preB ALL sample showed expression of activated a4b1 integrin at different levels. In order to determine the specificity of activated a4b1 integrin expression hematopoietic stem cells from three normal bone marrow BM samples were analyzed and showed very low levels of activated a4b1 integrin expression. Furthermore we have identified 32 analogues of LLP2A using three fresh preB ALL samples to screen two LLP2A-focused libraries. Peptide microarrays using a polystyrene slide coated with neutravidin and biotinylated ligands will be prepared with these analogues. We will determine the binding affinity and specificity of these analogues to a series of primary ALL cells. Binding specificity to leukemia cells will be determined by excluding ligands which bind to normal hematopoietic progenitor CD34 cells. The property of the selected ligands will be tested in vivo using NSG mice engrafted with primary ALL cells. Updated results with these new ligands will be presented at the meeting.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To describe longitudinal multimodal imaging findings of nonexudative choroidal neovascularization in CTRP5 late-onset retinal degeneration. METHODS Four patients with CTRP5-positive late-onset retinal degeneration underwent repeated ophthalmoscopic examination and multimodal imaging. All four patients two siblings and their cousins from a pedigree described previously had the heterozygous S163R mutation. RESULTS All four patients demonstrated large subretinal lesions in the mid-peripheral retina of both eyes. The lesions were characterized by confluent hypercyanescence with hypocyanescent borders on indocyanine green angiography faintly visible branching vascular networks with absentminimal leakage on fluorescein angiography Type 1 neovascularization on optical coherence tomography angiography and absent retinal fluid consistent with nonexudative choroidal neovascularization. The neovascular membranes enlarged substantially over time and the birth of new membranes was observed but all lesions remained nonexudativeminimally exudative. Without treatment all involved retinal areas remained free of atrophy and subretinal fibrosis. CONCLUSION We report the existence of massive advancing nonexudative Type 1 choroidal neovascularization in CTRP5 late-onset retinal degeneration. These findings have implications for age-related macular degeneration. They provide a monogenic model system for studying the mechanisms underlying the distinct events of choroidal neovascularization development enlargement progression to exudation and atrophy in age-related macular degeneration. They suggest that choroidal hypoperfusion precedes neovascularization and that nonexudative neovascularization may protect against atrophy.",

In addition various ATV safety guidelines regarding youth e.g. CPSC ANSISVIA ASI are inconsistent and may not align with state or local laws. To the best of our knowledge no comprehensive studies have compared the physical and mental requirements for riding ATVs and the youths capabilities to ride ATVs safely. Consequently there are no scientific-based recommendations for age limitation physical and mental capabilities and safety requirements for youth to ride ATVs safely. Thus there is a need to review the available sources related to youth safety and ATVs in the agricultural industry identify the research voids and recommend modifications to current ATV guidelines.

Recent reports suggest that VTE in hematological malignancies is not rare.jatsp jatspMaterials and Methods The California Cancer Registry was linked to both the California Patient Discharge Data Set and the master death registry to determine the incidence of VTE exclusive of upper extremity DVT in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia AML and acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL over a 6-year period and overall survival. Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to analyze the effect of potential risk factors on the incidence of VTE and death.jatsp jatspResults There were 5394 cases with AML 45.4 women mean age 60.4 21 years. The cumulative incidence and person-time rate of VTE are shown in the table. Significant predictors of VTE were female sex hazard ratio HR1.4 CI 1.01.9 2 chronic co-morbidities HR 1.8 CI 1.22.6 the presence of a catheter HR1.6 CI 1.12.3 and advancing age HR 4 for each decade starting at 16 years but not FAB category. Diagnosis of VTE was not associated with reduced survival. Significant predictors of death within 2 years were an increasing number of chronic co-morbidities HR 1.3 for increasing co-morbidities and advancing age referent age lt 16 HR 1.6 for each decade. FAB M3 was associated with improved survival. There were 2482 cases of ALL 42.7 women mean age 25.3 25 years. The cumulative incidence and person-time incidence rate of VTE are shown in the table. Three or more co-morbidities HR2.5 CI 1.25.0 increasing age HR 5.4 for each decade and the presence of a catheter HR2.3 CI 1.34.3 were risks factors for VTE but not FAB classification. Predictors of death in patients with ALL were 3 co-morbidities HR1.5 CI 1.21.9 increasing age HR 3.6 for each decade and FAB L3 but not VTE.jatsp jatspConclusions VTE in patients with AMLALL was not rare. The two-year cumulative incidence of VTE in patients with either AML or ALL was about 3.6 with over half the cases diagnosed in the first 3 months. This incidence and time course are similar to the findings reported among patients with solid tumors. Presence of chronic medical co-morbidities was associated with development of VTE as was the presence of a catheter. The higher risk of VTE in females with AML is unexplained. In contrast to patients with solid tumors VTE was not a predictor for shortened survival in acute leukemia patients. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in patients hospitalized with acute leukemia.jatsp jatspCumulative Incidence and Rate of VTE in Acute Leukemia Cumulative Incidence Rate per 100 patient years Time AML n5394 ALL n2482 AML ALL lt 3 months 120 2.2 52 2.1 12.6 9.3 46 months 34 0.6 18 0.7 5.1 3.5 712 months 27 0.5 13 0.5 2.8 1.4 1324 months 14 0.3 9 0.4 1.1 0.5 Total 195 3.6 92 3.7 5.0 2.5jatsp",

    "abstract": "Exploratory Data Analysis EDA approaches are adopted to address the difficult extreme-K categorical sample problem. Due to observed datas categorical nature all comparisons among populations are performed by comparing their distributions in the form of a histogram with symbolic bins. A distance measure is designed to evaluate the discrepancy between two symbol-based histograms to facilitate Hierarchical Clustering HC algorithms. The resultant binary HC-tree then serves as the basis for our EDA task of discovering tree-patterns of interest. Since each population-leafs location within a binary HC-trees geometry is expressed through a binary code sequence a binary code segment characterizes all commonly shared tree-patterns for all members. We then generate a large ensemble of mimicries of the observed dataset based on multinomial distributions and construct a large ensemble of binary HC-trees. Upon each identified tree-pattern which we determined based on the observed dataset we evaluate its reliability and uncertainty through two histograms.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND We identified commonly deficient standards across rectal cancer programs that underwent accreditation review by the National Accreditation Program for Rectal Cancer to evaluate for patterns of noncompliance. STUDY DESIGN With the use of the internal database of the American College of Surgeons programs that underwent accreditation review from 2018 to 2020 were evaluated. The occurrence and frequency of noncompliance with the standards using the 2017 standards manual were evaluated. Programs were further stratified based on the year of review annual rectal cancer volume and Commission on Cancer classification. RESULTS A total of 25 programs with annual rectal cancer volume from 14 to more than 200 cases per year underwent accreditation review. Only 2 programs achieved 100 compliance with all standards. Compliance with standards ranged from 48 to 100. The 2 standards with the lowest level of compliance included standard 2.5 and standard 2.11 that require all patients with rectal cancer to be discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting before the initiation of definitive treatment and within 4 weeks after definitive surgical therapy respectively. Patterns of noncompliance persisted when programs were stratified on the basis oof the year of survey annual rectal cancer volume and Commission on Cancer classification. The corrective action process allowed all programs to ultimately become successfully accredited. CONCLUSION During this initial phase of the National Accreditation Program for Rectal Cancer accreditation the majority of programs undergoing review did not achieve 100 compliance and went through a corrective action process. Although the minimal multidisciplinary team meeting attendance requirements were simplified in the 2021 revised standards noncompliance related to presentation of all patients at the multidisciplinary team meeting before and after definitive treatment highlights the need for programs seeking accreditation to implement optimized and standardized workflows to achieve compliance.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 infection is still a mystery in terms of its long-term effect on health and its consequences on hematological disorders. Prior studies including ours have shown the abnormal changes in hematopoietic cells in COVID-19 patients. In this article we are presenting 2 cases of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL with a previous history of COVID-19 infection. The first case describes a 22-month-old boy presenting with lymphadenopathy neutropenia and anemia with concurrent COVID-19 infection without any evidence of a hematolymphoid neoplasm as per bone marrow and lymph node biopsy. However he presented after 2 months with bone marrow biopsy confirming B-ALL. The second case is that of a 4-year-old girl presenting with B-ALL who has had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection 5 months before this current presentation. Both the cases had complete resolution of COVID-19 infection during the time of presentation with acute leukemia. There were notably 2 rare findings along the course of the patients illnesses. First the unusual plasmacytosis in the marrow during active COVID-19 infection in the first patient and the second is predilection of development of B-ALL following COVID-19. In both the cases the fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH studies showed pathologic alteration of the RUNX1 gene. Overall there are no literature to support a causal association between acute B-ALL and COVID-19. The diagnosis of B-ALL in these patients after COVID-19 infection may be totally unrelated. However if we consider Greaves proposed 2-hit model for childhood acute leukemia that an infectious agent can precipitate development of B-ALL in a genetically susceptible individual. Alteration of the RUNX1 gene in both the patients opens a door for further exploration of the second-hit hypothesis regarding an infectious agent precipitating development of B-ALL in a genetically susceptible individual.",

The nonnatural deoxyribonucleoside 1-2-deoxy--D-ribofuranosyl-4-3-benzamidophenylimidazole D3 was synthesized in four steps and incorporated by automated methods into pyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Within a pyrimidine oligonucleotide D3 binds pyrimidine-purine base pairs with higher affinity than it binds purine-pyrimidine base pairs. From affinity-cleaving analysis the stabilities of base triplets decrease in the order D3TA D3CG D3AT D3GC. Such specificity allows binding by triple-helix formation at an 18 base pair site in SV40 DNA containing all four base pairs at physiologically relevant pH and temperature.

OBJECTIVE The objective was to evaluate the effects of antiretroviral therapy andor lipid-based nutrient supplements LNSs on B vitamin concentrations in breast milk from HIV-infected women in Malawi. DESIGN Breast milk was collected from 537 women recruited within the Breastfeeding Antiretrovirals and Nutrition study at 2 or 6 wk and 24 wk postpartum. Women were assigned to receive antiretrovirals and LNSs antiretrovirals only LNSs only or a control. Antiretrovirals and LNSs were given to the mothers from weeks 0 to 28. The antiretrovirals were zidovudinelamivudine and nelfinavir or lopinavirritonavir. LNSs provided 93-118 of the Recommended Dietary Allowances of thiamin riboflavin niacin pyridoxine and vitamin B-12. Infants were exclusively breastfed. RESULTS LNSs increased milk concentrations of all vitamins except thiamin whereas antiretrovirals lowered concentrations of nicotinamide pyridoxal and vitamin B-12. Although antiretrovirals alone had no significant effect on riboflavin concentrations they negatively affected the LNS-induced increase in this vitamin. Thiamin was not influenced by the study interventions. Concentrations of all B vitamins were much lower than usually accepted values. CONCLUSIONS All B vitamins were low in milk and all but thiamin were increased by maternal supplementation with LNSs. Antiretrovirals alone decreased concentrations of some B vitamins in milk. When LNS was given in addition to antiretrovirals the negative effect of antiretrovirals offset the positive effect of LNSs for all vitamins except thiamin.

To gain insight into the nature of these outbreaks the genetic variation in X. campestris pv. vitians strains from different geographical locations was examined. All strains were first tested for pathogenicity on lettuce plants and then genetic diversity was assessed using i gas-chromatographic analysis of bacterial fatty acids ii polymerase chain reaction analysis of repetitive DNA sequences rep-PCR iii DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region 1 ITS1 of the ribosomal RNA iv restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP analysis of total genomic DNA with a repetitive DNA probe and v detection and partial characterization of plasmid DNA. Fatty acid analysis identified all pathogenic strains as X. campestris but did not consistently identify all the strains as X. campestris pv. vitians. The rep-PCR fingerprints and ITS1 sequences of all pathogenic X. campestris pv. vitians strains examined were identical and distinct from those of the other X. campestris pathovars. Thus these characteristics did not reveal genetic diversity among X. campestris pv. vitians strains but did allow for differentiation of X. campestris pathovars. Genetic diversity among X. campestris pv. vitians strains was revealed by RFLP analysis with a repetitive DNA probe and by characterization of plasmid DNA. This diversity was greatest among strains from different geographical regions although diversity among strains from the same location also was detected. The results of this study suggest that these X. campestris pv. vitians strains are not clonal but comprise a relatively homogeneous group.",

This approach was previously introduced and applied to d k constrained codes. Results show that the maximum average rate of the bit stuffing code achieves capacity when k d 1 or k while it is suboptimal for all other d k pairs. Furthermore this technique was generalized to produce codes with an average rate that achieves capacity for all d k pairs. However this extension results in a more complicated scheme. This correspondence proposes a modification to the bit stuffing algorithm that maintains its simplicity. We show analytically that the proposed algorithm achieves improved average rates over bit stuffing for most d k constraints. We further determine all constraints for which this scheme produces codes with an average rate equal to the Shannon capacity. 2005 IEEE.",

Diazepam at all doses provided significant protection against cocaine- p less than or equal to 0.01 and methamphetamine- p less than or equal to 0.05 induced seizures and produced a dose-dependent effect against amphetamine-induced seizures. MK-801 at all doses reduced seizures in all groups p less than or equal to 0.01. Propranolol altered the incidence of methamphetamine-induced seizures. Significant protection against cocaine-induced death was afforded by diazepam p less than or equal to 0.01 and propranolol p less than or equal to 0.05. Significant protection against amphetamine-induced death was provided by haloperidol all doses p less than or equal to 0.1 MK-801 all doses p less than or equal to 0.1 and propranolol 10 and 20 mgkg p less than or equal to 0.1. No agent reduced the incidence of methamphetamine- 50 or 100 mgkg induced death. The failure of d-amphetamine antagonists to protect against methamphetamine-induced toxicity and death suggest that different mechanisms of toxicity may exist between these drugs.",

    "abstract": "Chronic injury to the liver leads to inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis which when untreated can lead to myofibroblast activation and fibrogenesis with deposition of fibrous tissue. Over time liver fibrosis can accumulate and lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease with associated portal hypertension and liver failure. Detection and accurate measurement of the severity of liver fibrosis are important for assessing disease severity and progression directing patient management and establishing prognosis. Liver biopsy generally considered the clinical standard of reference for detecting and measuring liver fibrosis is invasive and has limitations including sampling error relatively high cost and possible complications. For these reasons liver biopsy is suboptimal for fibrosis screening longitudinal monitoring and assessing therapeutic efficacy. A variety of established and emerging qualitative and quantitative noninvasive MRI methods for detecting and staging liver fibrosis might ultimately serve these purposes. In this article we review multiple MRI methods for detecting and measuring liver fibrosis and discuss the diagnostic performance and specific strengths and limitations of the various techniques.",

In this study we evaluated the chemotherapeutic efficacy of 5 novel phospho-NSAIDs each of which includes in addition to the NSAID moiety a diethylphosphate linked through a butane moiety. All 5 compounds inhibited the growth of human breast colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines with micromolar potency. In vivo investigations confirmed the antitumor activity of phospho-aspirin PA and phospho-sulindac PS in inhibiting tumor growth in established human xenograft models in which cell proliferation was suppressed and apoptosis enhanced in the absence of detectable animal toxicity. Notably all of the phospho-NSAIDs tested induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in cultured cells with PA and PS inducing detectable levels of oxidative stress in vivo that were associated positively with apoptosis and negatively with proliferation. Potentially explaining these effects all of the phospho-NSAIDs tested also inhibited the thioredoxin system and the redox sensitive transcription factor NF-B. Taken together our findings show the strong anticancer efficacy and promising safety of phospho-NSAIDs in preclinical models of breast colon and pancreatic cancer suggesting further evaluation as anticancer agents.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To describe recruitment enrollment and participation in a study of US radiologists invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial of two continuing medical education CME interventions designed to improve interpretation of screening mammography. METHODS We collected recruitment consent and intervention-completion information as part of a large study involving radiologists in California Oregon Washington New Mexico New Hampshire North Carolina and Vermont. Consenting radiologists were randomized to receive either a 1-day live expert-led educational session to receive a self-paced DVD with similar content or to a control group delayed intervention. The impact of the interventions was assessed using a preintervention-postintervention test set design. All activities were institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant. RESULTS Of 403 eligible radiologists 151 of 403 37.5 consented to participate in the trial and 119 of 151 78.8 completed the preintervention test set leaving 119 available for randomization to one of the two intervention groups or to controls. Female radiologists were more likely than male radiologists to consent to and complete the study P .03. Consenting radiologists who completed all study activities were more likely to have been interpreting mammography for 10 years or less compared to radiologists who consented and did not complete all study activities or did not consent at all. The live intervention group was more likely to report their intent to change their clinical practice as a result of the intervention compared to those who received the DVD 50 versus 17.6 P .02. The majority of participants in both interventions groups felt the interventions were a useful way to receive CME mammography credits. CONCLUSIONS Community radiologists found interactive interventions designed to improve interpretative mammography performance acceptable and useful for clinical practice. This suggests CME credits for radiologists should in part be for examining practice skills.",

    "abstract": "The plant hormone ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening and plays a major role in the development of superficial scald in apple fruits during cold storage. The effect of cold storage at 0 degrees C on development of superficial scald and bitter pit BP in transgenic Greensleeves GS apples suppressed for ethylene biosynthesis was investigated. Four apple lines were used untransformed GS line 68G suppressed for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ACC oxidase ACO and lines 103Yand 130Y suppressed for ACC synthase ACS. Fruits from the transformed lines 68G 103Y and 130Y produced very little ethylene during 3 months of cold storage at 0 degrees C and after subsequent transfer to 20 degrees C whereas untransformed fruits produced significant ethylene during cold storage which increased dramatically at 20 degrees C. Respiration expressed as CO2 production was similar in all four apple lines. After 2 months at 0 degrees C all apple lines showed some BP symptoms but lines 68G and 103Y were more affected than untransformed GS or line 130Y. Both transformed and untransformed apples produced alpha-farnesene but concentrations were lower in yellow fruit than in green fruit in all lines but 68G. Line 68G produced the most alpha-farnesene after 2 months at 0 degrees C including both EE alpha-farnesene and ZE alpha-farnesene. Concentrations of EE alpha-farnesene were 100 times greater than those of ZE alpha-farnesene in all lines. After 4 months at 0 degrees C plus 1 week at 20 degrees C untransformed GS apples exhibited the most superficial scald whereas fruits from lines 68G and 103Y were less affected and line 130Y had no scald. Superficial scald severity was higher in green fruit than in yellow fruit in all affected lines. These lines also exhibited significant production of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one MHO a major oxidation product of EE alpha-farnesene. Line 130Y neither exhibited superficial scald nor produced MHO. It is shown here that even transgenic apples suppressed for ethylene biosynthesis genes can produce alpha-farnesene which in turn can oxidize to free radicals and MHO leading to scald development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Adetomyrma venatrix representing a new genus and species of ant is described from a single collection of twentyone workers from Zombitse Forest in western Madagascar. Remarkable features of its morphology include i absence of a petiole in dorsal view abdominal tergum 3 lacking a dorsally differentiated pretergite ii gaster large and expanded posteriorly all terga and sterna unfused and without constrictions iii absence of eyes and iv presence of a very large sting larger in relation to body size than that of any other known ant. Adetomyrma does not possess any of the derived features heretofore said to characterize the existing ant subfamilies. Morphological evidence suggests however that it is cladistically a member of the ponerine tribe Amblyoponini despite the absence of apomorphic abdominal characters tergosternal fusion of abdominal segments 3 and 4 seen in all other Ponerinae and in the more inclusive poneroid group of subfamilies. Whether Adetomyrma shows primitive absence of such characters or secondary reversal to an unfused state has important implications for the higher phylogeny of the ants. There is insufficient evidence to choose decisively between these two alternatives but in either case the monophyly of the ant subfamily Ponerinae becomes doubtful. Copyright 1994 Wiley Blackwell.

    "abstract": "-synuclein aggregation is present in Parkinsons disease and other neuropathologies. Among the assemblies that populate the amyloid formation process oligomers and short fibrils are the most cytotoxic. The human Hsc70-based disaggregase system can resolve -synuclein fibrils but its ability to target other toxic assemblies has not been studied. Here we show that this chaperone system preferentially disaggregates toxic oligomers and short fibrils while its activity against large less toxic amyloids is severely impaired. Biochemical and kinetic characterization of the disassembly process reveals that this behavior is the result of an all-or-none abrupt solubilization of individual aggregates. High-speed atomic force microscopy explicitly shows that disassembly starts with the destabilization of the tips and rapidly progresses to completion through protofilament unzipping and depolymerization without accumulation of harmful oligomeric intermediates. Our data provide molecular insights into the selective processing of toxic amyloids which is critical to identify potential therapeutic targets against increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorders.",

Five treatments were used Resident Vegetation RV Till Oats Till OatsLegumes Till Oats NoTill and OatsLegumes NoTill. No differences in soil nutrient availability were found among the treatments. Of the numerous nutritional constituents analyzed on leaf petioles and blades only NO3-Npetiole was affected by floor management. At nearly all growth stages among all years NO3-Npetiole of tilled treatments was twice the no-till treatments. At harvest yield mean cluster weight cluster number per vine and aboveground cover crop biomass differed among treatments in 2009 andor 2010 but not in the first year 2008 however responses were not consistent among treatments within each respective year. Importantly yields were similar from all four cover crop treatments compared to the typical management RV Till suggesting that use of cover crops andor no-till practices may be implemented in an irrigated vineyard with little immediate effect on grape productivity in mature vineyards. 2013 by the American Society for Enology and Viticulture.

    "abstract": "In this study the detailed mechanisms of the rapid-folding Trp-cage mini-protein were investigated by extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of both wild-type and mutant proteins using a recently developed point-charge force field within the AMBER simulation package and the generalized Born treatment of solvation. Among the 77 100-ns simulations performed on the wild-type protein 5 of the simulation trajectories yielded structures with main-chain RMSDs of 1.0-2.0 from the native NMR structure. A gradual reduction in the value of the main-chain RMSD distribution was observed during the simulations which is consistent with the folding funnel theory. The folding time of 3 s based on native tertiary contacts is in reasonable agreement with an experimental value of 4 s. Detailed analysis suggests that packing of the structurally important Trp 25 side chain is involved in the rate-limiting step and unfolding of the misfolded states and overcoming the additional entropic barrier also contributed to the rate-limiting steps. This is reinforced by the faster folding rate of the W25F mutant. Two putative folding pathways were observed from the simulations and their folding rates differed by about 200-fold leading to a 3.2 kcalmol folding free energy barrier difference. Of this approximately 2.2 kcalmol was due to unfolding of the misfolded states and about 1.0 kcalmol was due to overcoming the entropic cost to move Trp 25 side chain into the native orientation. Although formation of the main-chain contacts was not the rate-limiting step we observed a hierarchical process in which the short-range native contacts formed faster than the long-range ones. These observations are consistent with the contact-order theory.",

As these femtocells can be deployed in an ad hoc manner by different consumers in the same frequency band the femtocells can interfere with each other. To fully realize the potential of the femtocells it is necessary to allocate resources to them in such a way that interference is mitigated. We propose a distributed resource allocation algorithm for femtocell networks that is modelled after link-state routing protocols. Resource allocation using Link State Propagation RALP consists of a graph formation stage where individual femtocells build a view of the network an allocation stage where every femtocell executes an algorithm to assign OFDMA resources to all the femtocells in the network and local scheduling stage where a femtocell assigns resources to all user equipments based on their throughput requirements. Our evaluation shows that RALP performs better than existing femtocell resource allocation algorithms with respect to spatial reuse and satisfaction rate of required throughput. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

All other dogs and most mammals excrete allantoin a water-soluble compound that is further along the purine degradation pathway. Excretion of uric acid at high concentrations hyperuricosuria predisposes Dalmatians to the formation of urinary urate calculi. Hyperuricosuria huu is found in all Dalmatians tested and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A genome scan and linkage analysis performed on a Dalmatian x Pointer interbreed backcross detected a single linked marker REN153P03 located on CFA03. Haplotype analysis of the region around this marker defined a 3.3-Mb interval flanked by single recombination events. This interval which contains the huu mutation is estimated to include 24 genes.",

Using selected initial pattern ensembles state space structures in this high-dimensional nonlinear spatial system can be identified via the resulting decay to its attractors. Considered over a range of lattice sizes the decay behavior falls into three main classes each of which shows a characteristic profile. The first consists of even-size lattices showing a decelerating decay to small nonattracted ensemble fractions. The second class also for even lattices is a catastrophic decay to very small or vanishing nonattracted fractions. The third class also shows catastrophic decay and contains all odd-size lattices. Stochastic models are constructed that mimic the behavior of typical lattices throughout their evolution until finite-size effects appear. Weak additive noise causes all states on all lattices to fall into the attractor. In the end we find it overwhelmingly likely that the recently proposed attractor-basin portrait captures the CAs qualitative dynamics.",

Body composition plasma lipids leptin and adiponectin were measured. mRNA levels for leptin adiponectin lipoprotein lipase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 were measured in a visceral epididymal and a subcutaneous femoral fat depot by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Correlations among traits exhibited one of three patterns similar lines for B6 and Ay mice different slopes for B6 and Ay mice andor different intercepts for B6 and Ay mice. Correlations involving plasma leptin mesenteric and epididymal adipose weights or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were most likely to have different slopes andor intercepts in B6 and Ay mice. mRNA levels for leptin Acrp30 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and lipoprotein lipase in epididymal adipose tissue were not correlated with corresponding levels in femoral adipose tissue. DISCUSSION The agouti protein interferes with leptin signaling at melanocortin receptors in the hypothalamus of Ay mice. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the melanocortin portion of the leptin-signaling pathway mediates effects primarily on certain fat depots and on some but not all components of cholesterol homeostasis.",

This study describes the development of a set of rating scales used to measure four dimensions of disruptive behavior that present frequent problems in patients with dementia physical aggression verbal aggression agitation and wandering. In addition a total disruptive behavior scale is derived by averaging scores from these four scales. A sample of 16 patients in a skilled nursing facility was used to test interrater reliability and validity of this instrument. Interrater reliability was quite favorable for all scales. There was clear evidence for convergent validity of all scales except the verbal aggression scale where a substantial correlation was found with one relevant external measure but not the other. There was also favorable evidence of discriminant validity for all scales except the verbal aggression scale. Psychometric properties of this instrument appear to be promising and indicate that it has potential utility for further research on causes and treatments for disruptive behavior in demented patients.",

DESIGN Retrospective multicenter analysis. SETTING Five level-one trauma centers. PATIENTSPARTICIPANTS Two hundred ten patients 152 F 58 M average age 64 with 112 left- and 98 right-sided low-energy proximal humerus fractures OTAAO 11-A-C. INTERVENTION All patients were initially treated nonoperatively and were followed for an average of 231 days. Radiographic translation in the sagittal and coronal planes was measured. Patients with anterior translation were compared with those with posterior or no translation. Patients with 80 anterior humeral translation were compared with those with 80 anterior translation including those with no or posterior translation. MAIN OUTCOMES The primary outcome was failure of nonoperative treatment resulting in surgery and the secondary outcome was symptomatic malunion. RESULTS Nine patients 4 had surgery 8 for nonunion and 1 for malunion. All 9 patients 100 had anterior translation. Anterior translation compared with posterior or no sagittal plane translation was associated with failure of nonoperative management requiring surgery P 0.012. In addition of those with anterior translation having 80 anterior translation compared with 80 was also associated with surgery P 0.001. Finally 26 patients were diagnosed with symptomatic malunion of whom translation was anterior in 24 and posterior in 2 P 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS In a multicenter series of proximal humerus fractures anterior translation of 80 was associated with failure of nonoperative care resulting in nonunion symptomatic malunion and potential surgery.

PROCEDURES Medical records of dogs examined between September 2012 and July 2018 were reviewed for diagnoses of anterior ALL or posterior PLL lens luxation or lens subluxation. RESULTS Estimates of IOP obtained with rebound and applanation tonometry significantly differed from each other for all types of lens instability considered collectively mean SE difference between tonometric readings 8.1 1.3 mm Hg and specific types of lens instability considered individually mean SE difference between tonometric readings ALL 12.8 2.5 mm Hg PLL 5.9 1.7 mm Hg subluxation 2.8 0.8 mm Hg. Median range differences between rebound and applanation tonometer readings for dogs with ALL was 5 mm Hg -9 to 76 mm Hg with PLL was 3 mm Hg -1 to 19 mm Hg and with lens subluxation was 3 mm Hg -9 to 18 mm Hg. In eyes with ALL rebound tonometer readings exceeded applanation tonometer readings on 44 of 60 73 occasions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Rebound tonometry yielded higher estimates of IOP than did applanation tonometry in eyes with ALL and with all types of lens luxation considered collectively. Estimates of IOP in eyes with lens instability should ideally be obtained with both rebound and applanation tonometers. Veterinarians with only one type of tonometer should interpret results for dogs with lens instability concurrent with physical examination findings.",

    "abstract": "Urine metabolites are used in many clinical and biomedical studies but usually only for a few classic compounds. Metabolomics detects vastly more metabolic signals that may be used to precisely define the health status of individuals. However many compounds remain unidentified hampering biochemical conclusions. Here we annotate all metabolites detected by two untargeted metabolomic assays hydrophilic interaction chromatography HILIC-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry and charged surface hybrid CSH-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry. Over 9000 unique metabolite signals were detected of which 42 triggered MSMS fragmentations in data-dependent mode. On the highest Metabolomics Standards Initiative MSI confidence level 1 we identified 175 compounds using authentic standards with precursor mass retention time and MSMS matching. An additional 578 compounds were annotated by precursor accurate mass and MSMS matching alone MSI level 2 including a novel library specifically geared at acylcarnitines CarniBlast. The rest of the metabolome is usually left unannotated. To fill this gap we used the in silico fragmentation tool CSIFingerID and the new NIST hybrid search to annotate all further compounds MSI level 3. Testing the top-ranked metabolites in CSIFinger ID annotations yielded 40 accuracy when applied to the MSI level 1 identified compounds. We classified all MSI level 3 annotations by the NIST hybrid search using the ClassyFire ontology into 21 superclasses that were further distinguished into 184 chemical classes. ClassyFire annotations showed that the previously unannotated urine metabolome consists of 28 derivatives of organic acids 16 heterocyclics and 16 lipids as major classes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The recD mutants of the Antarctic Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and fail to grow at 4 degrees C. Generally RecD associates with two other proteins RecB and RecC to produce RecBCD enzyme which is involved in homologous recombination and DNA repair in many bacteria including Escherichia coli. However RecD is not essential for DNA repair nor does its deletion cause any growth defects in E. coli. Hence the assessment of the P. syringae RecBCD pathway was imperative. METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS Mutational analysis and genetic complementation studies were used to establish that the individual null-mutations of all three genes recC recB and recD or the deletion of whole recCBD operon of P. syringae lead to growth inhibition at low temperature and sensitivity to UV and mitomycin C. Viability of the mutant cells dropped drastically at 4 degrees C and the mutants accumulated linear chromosomal DNA and shorter DNA fragments in higher amounts compared to 22 degrees C. Additional genetic data using the mutant RecBCD enzymes that were inactivated either in the ATPase active site of RecB RecBK29Q or RecD RecDK229Q or in the nuclease center of RecB RecBD1118A and RecBDelta nuc suggested that while the nuclease activity of RecB is not so critical in vivo the ATP-dependent functions of both RecB and RecD are essential. Surprisingly E. coli recBCD or recBC alone on plasmid could complement the defects of the Delta recCBD strain of P. syringae. CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE All three subunits of the RecBCDPs enzyme are essential for DNA repair and growth of P. syringae at low temperatures 4 degrees C. The RecD requirement is only a function of the RecBCD complex in the bacterium. The RecBCD pathway protects the Antarctic bacterium from cold-induced DNA damages and is critically dependent on the helicase activities of both RecB and RecD subunits but not on the nuclease of RecBCDPs enzyme.",

For B-lineage ALL CD22 is an ideal target for ADC therapy because it is expressed on the majority of B-lineage ALL cells and because antibody binding mediates receptor internalization. HB22.7-SAP is a conjugate of our anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody mAb HB22.7 and the ribosome inhibiting protein saporin SAP. In vitro HB22.7-SAP effectively bound to CD22 on the surface of pre-B ALL cell lines and exhibited potent and specific cytotoxicity.

This prevents us from quantifying the main and interactive effects of anthropogenic environmental and climate change on species loss. Here we demonstrate that the estimated proportion of species loss of 252 key protected vertebrate species at a county level of China during the past half century was 27.2 for all taxa 47.7 for mammals 28.8 for amphibians and reptiles and 19.8 for birds. Both human population increase and species richness showed significant positive correlations with species loss of all taxa combined mammals birds and amphibians and reptiles. Temperature increase was positively correlated with all-taxa and bird species loss. Precipitation increase was negatively correlated with species loss of birds. Human population change and species richness showed more significant interactions with the other correlates of species loss. High species richness regions had higher species loss under the drivers of human environmental and climate change than low-richness regions. Consequently ongoing human environmental and climate changes are expected to perpetuate more negative effects on the survival of key vertebrate species particularly in high-biodiversity regions.",

    "abstract": "A nutrition education-through-gardening program was conducted to encourage dietary behavior change and to promote psychological well-being among seniors. The model is based on psychosocial theories of perception of control and social support. The five-month intervention consisted of weekly contact with the participants with one bimonthly group meeting on nutrition one bimonthly group meeting on gardening and two individual visits at participants homes each month. A raised garden box was provided for growing vegetables. The intake of food in targeted categories was encouraged through lectures discussions behavior self-monitoring cards goal setting and social interactions. Pre- and post-test measures of dietary behaviors and attitudes related to nutrition and to gardening were collected. The project was conducted at an initial location and then replicated in the second year at two other sites. Significant changes in the intake of food in targeted categories were noted at all locations and scores on attitudinal measures also improved among seniors at all sites. Similar changes in dietary behavior and attitudinal scores across the three programs suggest the appropriateness of this program for a variety of settings. 1990 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.

ANIMALS 32 incontinent female dogs with intramural ectopic ureters. PROCEDURES A diagnosis of intramural ectopic ureters was made via cystoscopy and fluoroscopy in all patients. Transurethral CLA-EU via diode laser n 27 or Holmiumyttrium aluminum garnet laser 3 was performed to relocate the ectopic ureteral orifice cranially into the urinary bladder. All vaginal anomalies were treated with the laser concurrently. Follow-up evaluation was standardized and included urinary continence scoring serial bacteriologic culture of urine samples and a follow-up cystoscopy 6 to 8 weeks after CLA-EU. RESULTS Ectopic ureteral orifices of all dogs were initially located in the urethra. Eighteen of 30 dogs had bilateral ectopic ureters and 12 had unilateral ectopic ureters. All dogs had other concurrent urinary anomalies. At the time of last follow-up median 2.7 years after CLA-EU range 12 to 62 months 14 of 30 47 dogs did not require any additional treatments following CLA-EU to maintain urinary continence. For the 16 residually incontinent dogs the addition of medical management transurethral bulking-agent injection or placement of a hydraulic occluder was effective in 3 2 and 4 dogs respectively improving the overall urinary continence rate to 77 2330 dogs. One dog had evidence of polypoid cystitis at the neoureteral orifice 6 weeks after CLA-EU that was resolved at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE CLA-EU provided an effective safe and minimally invasive alternative to surgery for intramural ectopic ureters in female dogs.",

Despite aggressive treatment current approaches for preB ALL have significant limitations with a cure rate of only 30 in certain subtypes. In addition long-term survivors are at risk for late effects that include development of secondary malignancies and toxicity to visceral organs. Therefore there is a desperate need for more effective and less toxic therapy.jatsp jatspTreatments and outcome of the animals. Dash-dots PBS dots MXD3 ASO and aCD22 Ab unconjugated gray solid aCD22 Ab-ASO conjugates at 0.2mg of Abkgdose and black solid aCD22 Ab-ASO conjugates at 1mg of Abkgdose Treatments and outcome of the animals. Dash-dots PBS dots MXD3 ASO and aCD22 Ab unconjugated gray solid aCD22 Ab-ASO conjugates at 0.2mg of Abkgdose and black solid aCD22 Ab-ASO conjugates at 1mg of Abkgdosejatsp jatspPreviously we demonstrated that the transcription factor MXD3 is a critical regulator of preB ALL cell proliferation. Knockdown of MXD3 expression in preB ALL cells resulted in cell death as determined by annexin V and caspase assays Satake et al. British Journal of Haematology in press. We hypothesize that targeted delivery of an MXD3 therapeutic to preB ALL cells will increase therapy effectiveness and decrease off target effects and toxicity thus increasing the quality of life.jatsp jatspIn the current study we developed an antisense oligonucleotide ASO that specifically targets MXD3. Taking advantage of anti-CD22 antibody aCD22 Ab which specifically targets B cell ALL we developed aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO conjugates as a potential combined phenotypic and molecularly targeted therapeutic. In in vitro tests using the Reh ALL cell line we confirmed successful delivery of the aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO compound to leukemia cells. This correlated with MXD3 knockdown at the protein level and inhibition of leukemia cell growth. Cytotoxicity was tested on anonymized healthy donor normal blood cells including CD34 positive hematopoietic stem cells HSCs B cells and non-B cells from mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As expected cytotoxicity was observed in normal B cells but CD34 HSCs and non-B cells were unaffected. In combination with conventional preB ALL chemotherapy drugs vincristine or doxorubin we observed additive cytotoxic effects of aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO conjugates on cells in vitro.jatsp jatspWe determined the compound effectiveness in pre-clinical xenograft animal models of preB ALL using both the Reh cell line as well as a primary leukemia sample. Age matched female NODSCIDIL2Rg-- NSG mice were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups 1 PBS 2 MXD3 ASO and aCD22 Ab unconjugated at the equivalent dose of the high dose group 3 aCD22 Ab-ASO conjugates at 0.2mg of Abkgdose and 4 at 1mg of Abkgdose. Five million leukemia cells were inoculated either intravenously iv Reh or intra-bone marrow primary cells to each mouse. Twenty-four hours following leukemia inoculation animals started receiving twice weekly iv treatments for 3 weeks. All mice treated with PBS and unconjugated MXD3 ASO amp aCD22 Ab died of leukemia at approximately day 21 in the Reh model and at day 30 in the primary leukemia model Figure. Animals treated with aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO conjugates either at low or high dose had significantly prolonged survival both in the Reh plt0.0084 n4group and primary leukemia p0.0001 n8group xenograft models Log-rank Mantel-Cox test. Leukemia-related death was confirmed by necropsy. Harvested leukemia cells were HLA and CD22 positive. During treatment the mice in all the treatment groups remained healthy and active and did not lose weight. Toxicity was assessed in the primary leukemia model with weekly CBC and chemistry panels and revealed no significant toxicity.jatsp jatspIn conclusion we have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of the aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO conjugates in preB ALL. This is the first study to demonstrate effective direct ASO-conjugated monoclonal Ab-mediated delivery for the treatment of leukemia or other malignancies. Future studies will focus on the further characterization of the compound effectiveness of combination therapy with standard chemotherapeutic drugs and toxicological profile.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

Here we used confocal microscopy and simultaneously measured the global ryanodine-receptor-mediated leak rate Jleak and Ca sparks in intact mouse ventricular myocytes. We found that spark frequency and Jleak are correlated as expected if both are manifestations of a common phenomenon. However we also found that sparks explain approximately half of Jleak.

    "abstract": "The end-of-life waste management of cathode ray tube CRT funnel glass is a concern due to the high lead content 22 within the glass. Inappropriate and insufficient waste management methods can lead to both health and climate impacts. This paper evaluates five waste management options hazardous waste landfill municipal waste landfill pyrometallurgy closed-loop recycling and hydrometallurgy from environmental and economic standpoints. Environmental impacts are analyzed using two life-cycle assessment LCA methodologies CML2001 and Eco-Indicator 99. Economic feasibilities are analyzed using the technical cost modeling TCM method and the cost revenue and profits associated with each waste management option are compared. Results show that discarded CRT funnel glass transportation has a significant effect on both the LCA and TCM results. By taking into account the transportation impact all waste management options result in greenhouse gas emissions and reduced profit. A sensitivity analysis shows that the profit of closed-loop recycling pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy options all decrease with increases in transportation distance while the hydrometallurgy option is less sensitive to the distance than the other two options. LCA results show that closed-loop recycling corresponds to the lowest human health and global warming impacts followed by pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. Landfill options would generate the most environmental impact. Closed-loop recycling pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy generate more profits 110-450ton than the landfill options 45ton. All in all pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are the most feasible recycling processes for implementation in the United States. Closed-loop recycling is not feasible because the CRT glass market in the U.S. has become obsolete. Overall pyrometallurgy appears to be the most environmentally friendly and economical CRT funnel glass waste management option. However the hydrometallurgy option represents the lowest human health impact due to minimized lead emissions. This option also has greater opportunity for process improvement and is more geographically flexible including the potential to be executed on-site which allows this novel option the opportunity to become more competitive than the pyrometallurgy option if properly implemented. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The California Cancer Registry used to identify treated patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL diagnosed between 2009 and 2014 was linked with the statewide hospitalization database to determine cumulative incidences of UE DVT and subsequent VTE and bleeding after UE DVT diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association of UE DVT on the risk of subsequent pulmonary embolism PE or lower extremity deep vein thrombosis LE DVT and subsequent bleeding and the impact of UE DVT on mortality. There were 5072 patients identified 3252 had AML and 1820 had ALL. Three- and 12-month cumulative incidences of UE DVT were 4.8 95 confidence interval CI 4.1-5.6 and 6.6 95 CI 5.8-7.5 for AML and 4.1 95 CI 3.2-5.1 and 5.9 95 CI 4.9-7.1 for ALL respectively. Twelve-month cumulative incidences of subsequent VTE after an incident UE DVT diagnosis were 5.3 for AML and 12.2 for ALL. Twelve-month cumulative incidences of subsequent bleeding after an incident UE DVT diagnosis were 15.4 for AML and 21.1 for ALL. UE DVT was associated with an increased risk of subsequent bleeding for both AML hazard ratio HR 2.07 95 CI 1.60-2.68 and ALL HR 1.62 95 CI 1.02-2.57 but was not an independent risk factor for subsequent PE or LE DVT for either leukemia subtype.

Using previous data we assessed if individual epoxide-diol ratios all behave similarly to reflect changes in sEH activity and whether analyzing these ratios together increases the power to detect changes in in-vivo sEH activity. We demonstrated that epoxide-diol ratios correlated strongly with each other P 0.05 suggesting these ratios all reflect changes in sEH activity. Furthermore we developed a modeling approach to analyze all epoxide-diol ratios simultaneously to infer global sEH activity named SAMI Simultaneous Analysis of Multiple Indices. SAMI improved power in detecting changes in sEH activity in animals and humans when compared to individual ratio estimates. Thus we introduce a new powerful method to infer sEH activity by combining metabolomic determination and simultaneous analysis of all measurable epoxide-diol pairs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Donor human milk should be processed to guarantee microbiological safety prior to infant feeding but this process can influence the structure and quantity of functional proteins. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the effect of thawing homogenization vat-pasteurization Vat-PT retort sterilization RTR and ultra-high-temperature UHT processing on the structure of bioactive proteins in donor milk. METHODS Pooled donor milk was either not treated Raw or treated with an additional freeze-thaw cycle with and without homogenization Vat-PT RTR with and without homogenization and UHT processing with and without homogenization. Overall protein retention was assessed via sodium-dodecyl sulfate SDS-PAGE and the immunoreactivity of 13 bioactive proteins were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA. RESULTS Freeze-thawing freeze-thawing plus homogenization and Vat-PT preserved all the immunoglobulins sIgAIgA IgG IgM in donor milk whereas RTR and UHT degraded almost all immunoglobulins. UHT did not alter osteopontin immunoreactivity but Vat-PT and retort decreased it by 50 and 70 respectively. Freeze-thawing with homogenization Vat-PT and UHT reduced lactoferrins immunoreactivity by 35 65 and 84 respectively. Lysozyme survived unaltered throughout all processing conditions. In contrast elastase immunoreactivity was decreased by all methods except freeze-thawing. Freeze-thawing freeze-thawing plus homogenization and Vat-PT did not alter polymeric immunoglobulin receptor PIGR immunoreactivity but RTR RTR plus homogenization and UHT increased detection. All heat processing methods increased -lactalbumin immunoreactivity. Vat-PT preserved all the growth factors vascularendothelial growth factor and transforming growth factors 1 and 2 and UHT treatments preserved the majority of these factors. CONCLUSION Different bioactive proteins have different sensitivity to the treatments tested. Overall Vat-PT preserved more of the bioactive proteins compared with UHT or RTR. Therefore human milk processors should consider the impact of processing methods on key bioactive proteins in human milk.",

    "abstract": "The effect of prior inotuzumab ozogamicin InO treatment on brexucabtagene autoleucel brexu-cel outcomes remains unclear in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL. We conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of 189 patients with relapsedrefractory ALL treated with brexu-cel. Over half of the patients received InO before brexu-cel InO exposed. InO-exposed patients were more heavily pretreated P .02 and frequently had active marrow disease before apheresis P .03. Response rate and toxicity profile after brexu-cel were comparable for InO-exposed and InO-nave patients however consolidation therapy after brexu-cel response was used at a higher rate in InO-nave patients P .005. With a median follow-up of 11.4 months InO-exposed patients had inferior progression-free survival PFS P .013 and overall survival OS P .006 in univariate analyses however prior InO exposure did not influence PFS hazard ratio 1.20 95 confidence interval 0.71-2.03 in multivariate models. Within InO-exposed patients InO responders had superior PFS P .002 and OS P .0001 relative to InO-refractory patients. The timing of administering InO did not affect brexu-cel outcomes with comparable PFS P .51 and OS P .86 for patients receiving InO as bridging therapy or before apheresis. In conclusion although InO exposure was associated with inferior survival outcomes after brexu-cel in unadjusted analyses these associations were no longer significant in multivariate analyses suggesting it is unlikely that InO negatively affects brexu-cel efficacy. Our data instead imply that InO-exposed recipients of brexu-cel tend to be higher-risk patients with intrinsic adverse leukemia biology.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates comprehensive operation and experimentation of an all-optical packet switching router with optical label swapping and reamplification and reshaping 2R regeneration capable of multihop operation and Internet protocol IP-client interoperability. In particular the experiment demonstrates successful packet switching and transport up to 11 hops with 10-9 bit-error rate and error-free up to four hops. Furthermore this paper demonstrates the optical label switching OLS core router and edge routers working together to support IP-client-to-IP-cIient packet transport and switching across the optical label switching network. The edge router generates an optical label based on the IP header content of the packet and generates an optical label encoded packet which subsequently ingresses into the OLS network. The optical label switching router OLSR forwards the packet with all-optical label swapping at each hop with 2R regeneration. The 2R regeneration leads to an experimentally measured negative penalty and a successful experimental demonstration of multihop cascaded OLSR operation with the edge routers interfacing with IP clients. The successful IP-client-to-IP-client packet forwarding via the edge routers and the cascaded multihop OLSR with all-optical label swapping indicate the viability of OLS in the scalable and transparent IP-over-optical Internet.",

    "abstract": "B cell lymphomas are a diverse group of clinicopathologic diseases with an increasing incidence. As with other malignancies the accumulation of genetic abnormalities are required for malignant transformation of human lymphocytes. Cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 is a key biosynthetic enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous malignancies including colon breast and lung cancer. There is little data on the potential role of COX-2 in lymphoma pathogenesis. In this study several B lymphoma cell lines and primary B cells obtained from normal volunteer controls were examined for COX-2 protein expression. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated between an approximately 2.2-4.3-fold increase in COX-2 protein expression relative to primary B cells in all lymphoma cell lines examined. Increased COX-2 phosphorylation was found in the BJAB BL41 and Raji cells whereas the levels in Daudi Namalwa and Ramos did not differ from that of primary B cells. Treatment with 25-100 microM celecoxib CEL resulted in decreased proliferation as measured by 3Hthymidine in all cell lines examined and the effect was dose-dependent and not significantly enhanced by chlorambucil CHL. The effect of COX-2 inhibition on apoptosis in lymphoma cells was examined and revealed apoptotic induction of greater than 85 in all cell lines examined at 50 microM celecoxib. The pro-apoptotic effect was dose-dependent and was not significantly enhanced by chlorambucil. Examination of apoptosis-related proteins by immunoblot analysis revealed levels of BCL-2 BCL-XL and Bax to be unaffected by celecoxib. In contrast levels of Akt MCL-1 and phosphorylated SAP-kinase were all decreased after incubation with 50 microM celecoxib. These findings suggest that increased COX-2 expression and activity contributes to the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas and point to a possible role for COX-2 inhibition in their treatment.",

The recent reformulation of the amplituhedron in terms of combinatorial geometry directly in the kinematic momentum-twistor space plays a crucial role in understanding this geometry and determining the cut. This provides us with the first nontrivial results on scattering amplitudes in the theory valid for arbitrarily many loops and external particle multiplicities.",

Comparisons of the percent of human leukemia cells in blood and survival curves showed resveratrol did not inhibit progression of the disease. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of mouse sera showed resveratrol was rapidly metabolized to glucuronidated and sulfated forms 1 h post-injection with low to no resveratrol or metabolites observed in sera by 24-48 h.

This study was undertaken to investigate the therapeutic implications of the presence of well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts at the end of therapy for pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma. Six patients with pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma bladder-prostate 4 vulvovaginal 2 with disease diagnosed between the years 1974 and 1992 were sequentially investigated by cystoscopic or vaginoscopic examination and biopsy during and after completing therapy. All six patients received treatment according to prevailing therapeutic protocols. Biopsy material from all six patients at the end of therapy documented the presence of well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts. Repeated biopsies demonstrated the presence of rhabdomyoblasts however they appeared to decrease in number with time. Mitotic activity was not observed in the biopsy materials obtained. All six patients are alive without evidence of disease from 37 to 233 months after therapy ended. The presence of well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts at the end of therapy for pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma is a common finding. The biologic nature of these well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts is not completely known but they do not appear to connote the persistent presence of malignant disease and are not an indication for the continuation of therapy.",

Tissue accretion of the same dietary concentrations of PL- and TAG-docosahexaenoic acid 226n-3 DHA has not been compared and was the focus of this study. Mice n 12group were fed either a control diet or one of six DHA 1 2 or 4 as PL-DHA or TAG-DHA diets for 4 weeks. Compared with the control DHA concentration in liver adipose tissue AT heart and eye but not brain were significantly higher in mice consuming either PL- or TAG-DHA but there was no difference in DHA concentration in all tissues between the PL- or TAG-DHA forms. Consumption of PL- and TAG-DHA at all concentrations significantly elevated eicosapentaenoic acid 205n-3 EPA in all tissues when compared with the control group while docoshexapentaenoic acid 225n-6 DPA was significantly higher in all tissues except for the eye and heart. Both DHA forms lowered total omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6 PUFA in all tissues and total monounsaturated fatty acids MUFA in the liver and AT total saturated fatty acid SFA were lowered in the liver but elevated in the AT. An increase in the DHA dose independent of DHA forms significantly lowered n-6 PUFA and significantly elevated n-3 PUFA concentration in all tissues. Our results do not support the claim that the PL form of n-3 PUFA leads to higher n-3 PUFA tissue accretion than their TAG form.",

Although a recent meta-analysis Eastwick Luchies Finkel Hunt in press provided no support for this sex difference across 97 samples and 30000 participants Meltzer et al. 2014 responded by outlining 7 criteria required for an appropriate test of the sex difference these criteria eliminate all but 1 study from the meta-analysis. In this commentary we raise 3 concerns about Meltzer et al.s contribution. First there is weak theoretical and empirical support for the criteria they used to dismiss the relevance of the meta-analysis studies. Second if one adds Meltzer et al.s data to the meta-analysis all the sex differences remain extremely small and nonsignificant even if one focuses only on studies that best conform to Meltzer et al.s criteria i.e. married samples objective attractiveness measures. Third a new data set meeting all 7 criteria fails to replicate the Meltzer et al. sex difference in contrast data revealed that physical attractiveness is if anything more strongly associated with the trajectory of relationship satisfaction for women than for men. As noted by Eastwick Luchies et al. in press in paradigms where participants evaluate partners they have at a minimum met face-to-face the sex difference in the association of physical attractiveness with romantic evaluations is a extremely small on average and b unlinked to all cross-study characteristics identified to date.",

    "abstract": "Ray-finned fishes make up half of all living vertebrate species. Nearly all ray-finned fishes are teleosts which include most commercially important fish species several model organisms for genomics and developmental biology and the dominant component of marine and freshwater vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance of ray-finned fishes the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny with corresponding divergence-time estimates has limited our understanding of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36 fossil age constraints result in a well-supported phylogeny of all major ray-finned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs three long-standing problems specifically identifying elopomorphs eels and tarpons as the sister lineage of all other teleosts providing a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts and offering a promising strategy for resolution of the bush at the top of the tree that includes percomorphs and other spiny-finned teleosts. Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes we find that the former underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences but the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages. Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic identifying this period as the Second Age of Fishes.",

It provides polynomial-time embedding of arbitrary linear programs and integer programs in such slim transportation programs and in bipartite biflow programs. It resolves several standing problems on 3-way transportation polytopes. It demonstrates that the range of values an entry can attain in any slim 3-way contingency table with specified 2-margins can contain arbitrary gaps suggesting that disclosure of fc-margins of d-tables for 2 k d is confidential. Our construction also provides a powerful tool in studying concrete questions about transportation polytopes and contingency tables remarkably it enables to automatically recover the famous real-feasible integer-infeasible 6 x 4 x 3 transportation polytope of M. Vlach and to produce the first example of 2-margins for 6 x 4 x 3 contingency tables where the range of values a specified entry can attain has a gap. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",

DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING University teaching hospital. ANIMALS A total number of 84 dogs and 14 cats presenting to a university teaching hospital emergency room. PROCEDURES All dogs and cats in which venous blood samples for acid-base lactate and serum biochemical analysis were all collected within 60 minutes of each other over a 5-month enrollment period. Acid-base analysis was performed using the traditional approach Stewart approach and a semiquantitative approach. RESULTS Traditional acid-base analysis identified respiratory acid-base abnormalities in 1498 animals and metabolic acid-base abnormalities in 6798. A mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis was most common occurring in 2998 patients. The Stewart approach identified metabolic abnormalities in 8298 patients strong ion difference abnormalities were evident in 6898 cases an increased strong ion gap acidosis was identified in 4998 cases and changes in the quantity of weak acids in 2598 cases. The semiquantitative approach identified abnormalities in all cases evaluated. Of the 14 patients with a primary respiratory acid-base abnormality the Stewart approach identified metabolic abnormalities in 9 and the semiquantitative approach found abnormalities in all animals. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The physicochemical approaches diagnosed more acid-base abnormalities in this population than the traditional approach although many of the abnormalities identified were small and of unknown clinical relevance. The physicochemical approaches may provide greater insight as to the underlying etiology of abnormalities which maybe of particular relevance to cases with changes in albumin andor phosphorus concentration.",

However information regarding the representativeness of these clinical populations is limited and thus the generalizability of research findings is uncertain. METHODS Using data from the population-based California Cancer Registry we compared age-adjusted distributions of patient and neighborhood characteristics for three groups of breast cancer patients 1 those diagnosed within Kaiser Permanente Northern California KPNC 2 non-KPNC patients from NCI-designated cancer centers and 3 those from all other hospitals. RESULTS KPNC patients represented 32 N 36109 cancer center patients represented 7 N 7805 and all other hospitals represented 61 N 68330 of the total breast cancer patients from this geographic area during 1996-2009. Compared with cases from all other hospitals KPNC had slightly fewer non-Hispanic Whites 70.6 versus 74.4 but more Blacks 8.1 versus 5.0 slightly more patients in the 50-69 age range and fewer in the younger and older age groups a slightly lower proportion of in situ but higher proportion of stage I disease 41.6 versus 38.9 were slightly less likely to reside in the lowest 4.2 versus 6.5 and highest 36.2 versus 39.0 socioeconomic status neighborhoods and more likely to live in suburban metropolitan areas and neighborhoods with more racialethnic minorities. Cancer center patients differed substantially from patients from KPNC and all other hospitals on all characteristics assessed. All differences were statistically significant p .001. CONCLUSIONS Although much of clinical research discoveries are based in academic medical centers patients from large integrated medical centers are likely more representative of the underlying population providing support for the generalizability of cancer research based on electronic data from these centers.",

However the question of whether and if so how these increasingly blurred boundaries between activities are truly helping rather than hurting us is not presently well-understood. Using an attitudinally-rich travel survey of Northern California commuters N 2500 we develop a conceptual and empirically-based framework for studying benefits and disadvantages of travel-based multitasking. Through latent variable models of reported benefits and disadvantages of activities conducted on a recent commute we identify constructs associated with hedonic and productive benefits and with affective and cognitive disadvantages. This empirically-developed framework informs the definition of binary variables indicating the presenceabsence of each construct for a given traveler on the commute in question. We then present two bivariate binary probit models that examine the effects of person and trip attributes such as personality traits chosen mode commute preferences and activities conducted while traveling on the presence of those benefits and disadvantages respectively. Notably we find evidence that conditionsactivities that may facilitate multitasking benefits can also simultaneously yield disadvantages for example several activities conspicuously including talking on or otherwise using a phone increase the probability of receiving benefits while also increasing the probability of experiencing cognitive disadvantages. This finding resonates with the general multitasking literature and empirically corroborates the suggestion that travel-based multitasking may not uniformly increase trip utility.",

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the PED as a primary treatment for ruptured aneurysms with challenging morphologies. METHODS Three patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms presented with SAH. Three distinct and difficult-to-treat aneurysm morphologies were encountered 1 a small basilar trunk pseudoaneurysm 2 a carotid artery blister aneurysm and 3 an A1A2 junction-dissecting-type aneurysm. All were treated with deployment of one or more PEDs across the aneurysm. RESULTS PEDs were successfully deployed in all 3 cases. Two patients were treated with 2 overlapping PEDs and the third patient was treated with a single device. Aneurysm obliteration was achieved in all 3 cases with no early rehemorrhage or other clinically adverse event. CONCLUSION Endovascular treatment with the pipeline flow-diverting stent may be a viable treatment option for otherwise difficult-to-treat aneurysm morphologies in the context of acute SAH.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Whereas organized trauma care systems have decreased trauma mortality in the United States trauma system design has not been well addressed in developing nations. We sought to determine areas in greatest need of improvement in the trauma systems of developing nations. METHODS We compared outcome of all seriously injured Injury Severity Score or 9 or dead nontransferred adults managed over 1 year in three cities in nations at different economic levels 1 Kumasi Ghana low income gross national product GNP per capita of 310 no emergency medical service EMS 2 Monterrey Mexico middle income GNP 3900 basic EMS and 3 Seattle Washington high income GNP 25000 advanced EMS. Each city had one main trauma hospital from which hospital data were obtained. Annual budgets in US per bed for these hospitals were as follows Kumasi 4100 Monterrey 68000 and Seattle 606000. Data on prehospital deaths were obtained from vital statistics registries in Monterrey and Seattle and by an epidemiologic survey in Kumasi. RESULTS Mean age 34 years and injury mechanisms 79 blunt were similar in all locations. Mortality declined with increased economic level Kumasi 63 of all seriously injured persons died Monterrey 55 and Seattle 35. This decline was primarily due to decreases in prehospital deaths. In Kumasi 51 of all seriously injured persons died in the field in Monterrey 40 and in Seattle 21. Mean prehospital time declined progressively Kumasi 102 - 126 minutes Monterrey 73 - 38 minutes Seattle 31 - 10 minutes. Percent of trauma patients dying in the emergency room was higher for Monterrey 11 than for either Kumasi 3 or Seattle 6. CONCLUSIONS The majority of deaths occur in the prehospital setting indicating the importance of injury prevention in nations at all economic levels. Additional efforts for trauma care improvement in both low-income and middle-income developing nations should focus on prehospital and emergency room care. Improved emergency room care is especially important in middle-income nations which have already established a basic EMS.",

    "abstract": "A total of 66 transgenic rice cell lines were produced by simultaneously transforming rice callus with nine different plasmidsgenes. PCR analysis indicated that the co-transformation frequency of each gene was about 70. All the cell lines carried at least three genes and 11 cell lines carried all nine genes. Thirty-two fertile transgenic plants R0 were generated from the transgenic cell lines and seeds of 32 transgenic R1 lines and 5 R2 lines were harvested and analyzed for gene inheritance and protein expression. Progeny segregation analysis indicated that the multiple transgenes were integrated into the same locus of the rice genome resulting in a 31 segregation ratio of the transgenes. Expression analysis of all nine transgenes revealed that the transgenes were expressed in all generations R0 R1 and R2 and about half of the transgenes from each line were expressed. The expression of one transgene appears to have no effect on the expression of another transgene. Among the 66 cell lines six lines 9.1 expressed seven or eight transgenes out of the nine transformed genes. All together our results showed that multiple genes could be delivered into rice cells simultaneously and cell lines expressing multiple genes could be generated. The results and procedures reported here should be useful in designing multi-plasmid transformation experiments such as those required for plant metabolic engineering.",

The conservation equations are discretized with a reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin method and integrated in time with fully implicit time discretization schemes. The resulting set of non-linear equations is converged using a robust Newton-Krylov framework. Due to the stiffness of the underlying physics associated with stiff acoustic waves and viscous material strength effects we solve for the primitive-variables pressure velocity and temperature. To enable convergence of the highly ill-conditioned linearized systems we develop a physics-based preconditioner utilizing approximate block factorization techniques to reduce the fully-coupled 33 system to a pair of reduced 22 systems. We demonstrate that our preconditioned Newton-Krylov framework converges on very stiff multi-physics problems with excellent algorithmic and parallel scalability. Results are shown for the classic lid-driven cavity flow problem as well as for 3D laser-induced phase change.",

    "abstract": "The potential for differences between genetic paternity and paternity inferred from behavioral observation has long been recognized. These differences are associated with the challenge for females of seeking both genetic and material benefits this challenge is less severe in species with polygynous non-resource-based mating systems such as leks than in those with resource-based systems. We present the first study of paternity patterns in a non-resource-based species that does not form true leks. We compared paternity inferred from observed mating behavior to genetically assigned paternity in the Satin Bowerbird Ptilonorhynchus violaceus using eight microsatellite markers. Mating behavior was observed and recorded via automated video-cameras positioned at all bowers 29-34 bowers each year in the study site throughout each mating season. We obtained blood samples and identified mothers for 11 chicks in 9 nests. For all chicks the most likely genetic father had been observed to mate with the mother in the year the chick was sampled. All most likely genetic fathers were assigned with high confidence and all were bower-holding males. These results demonstrate that genetic paternity can be inferred from observed mating behavior with reasonable confidence in Satin Bowerbirds. Observed male mating-success is therefore a reliable predictor of reproductive success and this suggests that high skew in observed male mating-success translates directly to high skew in reproductive success.

    "abstract": "To better understand the evolution of dispersal in spatially heterogeneous landscapes we study difference equation models of populations that reproduce and disperse in a landscape consisting of k patches. The connectivity of the patches and costs of dispersal are determined by a k k column substochastic matrix S where S ij represents the fraction of dispersing individuals from patch j that end up in patch i. Given S a dispersal strategy is a K 1 vector whose ith entry gives the probability P i that individuals disperse from patch i. If all of the p is are the same then the dispersal strategy is called unconditional otherwise it is called conditional. For two competing populations of unconditional dispersers we prove that the slower dispersing population i.e. the population with the smaller dispersal probability displaces the faster dispersing population. Alternatively for populations of conditional dispersers without any dispersal costs i.e. S is column stochastic and all patches can support a population we prove that there is a one parameter family of strategies that resists invasion attempts by all other strategies. 2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",

ANIMALS STUDIED Twenty client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Canine patients diagnosed with KCS were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were randomly selected to receive either Vizoovet or GenTeal drops twice daily in addition to twice daily tacrolimus 0.03 solution. Data were collected from only one eye of each patient and included STT-1 IOP TFBUT and results of objective clinical scoring performed by pet owners. Statistical significance was set at P .05. RESULTS In all 20 dogs 20 eyes were enrolled in this prospective randomized study. Females n 12 60 outnumbered males n 8 40 and all dogs were spayedneutered. Mean age of all dogs was 10.6 3.79 years. In both treatment groups the improvement in STT-1 values over the course of the study was significant P .002. When comparing the STT-1 improvements between groups no significance was found P .78. In both groups the improvement in TFBUT was significant P .0018. When comparing the TFBUT improvements between groups no significance was found P .14. Squinting rubbing ocular discharge and medication administration scores all significantly improved throughout the course of the study however they did not differ significantly between groups. Throughout the study no adverse side effects were noted clinically or by the pet owner in either group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Adjunctive treatment with Vizoovet was as safe and effective as GenTeal drops at improving clinical signs of dry eye in dogs.",

    "abstract": "Caregiver coaching is an evidence-based practice for young autistic children but it is not widely used in community-based early intervention services. Previous research has explored why caregiver coaching is not widespread in early intervention but only from the perspective of early intervention providers. Caregivers providers and administrators are all involved in the decision of whether to use caregiver coaching in early intervention. Therefore it is important to include all perspectives in research regarding this practice. In this study we interviewed 20 caregivers of autistic children 36 early intervention providers and 6 administrators from early intervention agencies and asked questions about their perspectives regarding the use of caregiver coaching in early intervention. We did this to figure out what factors help and hinder the use of caregiver coaching in this setting and to see how caregivers providers and administrators agreed or disagreed on these factors. All participants agreed that caregivers attitudes and expectations can influence whether caregiver coaching is used. In addition all participants agreed that when caregivers and providers collaborate and have a strong working relationship it can facilitate the use of caregiver coaching in early intervention. Other factors such as caregiver stress and provider flexibility were also discussed. Based on these findings we suggest strategies that can be used to possibly increase the use of caregiver coaching in early intervention for autistic children and their families.",

    "abstract": "pWhile the health benefits of cycling and walking have been well established questions remain about whether these benefits hold in varying socioeconomic contexts including across demographic groups and in the context of neighborhood change. This study examines this relationship identifying associations between cycling or walking and self-reported health whether socioeconomic status moderates these associations and whether gentrification influences the potential moderating effects. This study uses the 2017 National Household Travel Survey subset to adults who lived in central cities n 88698. Weighted ordered logistic regression models were fit to estimate self-reported health status separately for cycling and walking. Gentrification was measured using an indicator based on previous research using US Census data. People who had cycled in the past week and each additional walking trip were associated with higher odds of reporting better health. Socioeconomic status moderated the positive associations between active transportation and health in a few key cases. Cycling was not as strongly associated with health for Black cyclists or employed cyclists while women had smaller benefits from each additional walking trip compared to men. Gentrification was an insignificant moderating factor in most cases. Findings suggest planning efforts that continue to support programs that promote cycling and walking are crucial tools in the public health toolbox. The health gains from active transportation might be experienced in a variety of neighborhood contexts. Nevertheless infrastructure investments and policy must be attentive to inequities across neighborhoods.p",

To assess the delivery accuracy with motion a unified testing framework was used. The average 2 2 mm -fail rates across all lung traces were 0.1 for motion adapted and 17.4 for no motion correction. Average 2 2 mm -fail rates across all prostate traces were 0.4 for motion adapted and 12.2 for no motion correction. Real-time motion adaption was shown to improve the accuracy of dose delivered to a moving phantom compared with no motion adaption.

Intraosseous cysts are commonly seen on imaging of FAI. In most cases these cysts are incidental and do not require specific treatment at the time of surgical treatment of hip impingement. However in some cases the cysts may mechanically compromise the acetabular rim or femoral neck. We present a technique for treating such cysts with an all-arthroscopic technique using a commercially available bone graft substitute composed of cancellous bone and demineralized bone matrix placed within an arthroscopic cannula for direct delivery into the cysts. This technique may be of benefit to surgeons treating FAI with an all-arthroscopic technique.",

    "abstract": "We propose a very simple reformulation of general relativity which completely sequesters from gravity all of the vacuum energy from a matter sector including all loop corrections and renders all contributions from phase transitions automatically small. The idea is to make the dimensional parameters in the matter sector functionals of the 4-volume element of the Universe. For them to be nonzero the Universe should be finite in spacetime. If this matter is the standard model of particle physics our mechanism prevents any of its vacuum energy classical or quantum from sourcing the curvature of the Universe. The mechanism is consistent with the large hierarchy between the Planck scale electroweak scale and curvature scale and early Universe cosmology including inflation. Consequences of our proposal are that the vacuum curvature of an old and large universe is not zero but very small that wDE -1 is a transient and that the Universe will collapse in the future.",

METHODS Data from routine clinic visits at multiple centres were collected in a systematic manner. Data included all domains identified as important in randomised controlled trials in PsA. Decisions to change treatment were used as surrogates for high disease activity. New indices were developed by multiple linear regression psoriatic arthritis disease activity score PASDAS and empirically utilising physician-defined cut-offs for disease activity arithmetic mean of desirability functions AMDF. These were compared with existing composite measures Composite Psoriatic arthritis Disease Activity Index CPDAI Disease Activity for PSoriatic Arthritis DAPSA and Disease Activity Score for rheumatoid arthritis DAS28. RESULTS 161503 32 subjects had treatment changes. Although all measures performed well compared with existing indices PASDAS was better able to discriminate between high and low disease activity area under receiver operating curves ROC curve with 95 CI PASDAS 0.773 0.723 0.822 AMDF 0.730 0.680 0.780 CPDAI 0.719 0.668 0.770 DAPSA 0.710 0.654 0.766 DAS28 0.736 0.680 0.792. All measures were able to discriminate between disease activity states in patients with oligoarthritis although area under the receiver operating curves AUC were generally smaller. In patients with severe skin disease psoriasis area and severity index10 both nonparametric and AUC curve statistics were nonsignificant for all measures. CONCLUSIONS Two new composite measures to assess disease activity in PsA have been developed. Further testing in other datasets including comparison with existing measures is required to validate these instruments.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To describe clinical skills progression during pediatric residency using the distribution of pediatric milestone assessments by subcompetency and year of training and to determine reasonable milestone expectations at time of graduation. METHOD Multi-institutional cohort study of the milestones reported to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for all 21 pediatric subcompetencies. Most subcompetencies were measured using five milestone levels 1 novice 2 advanced beginner 3 competent 4 proficient 5 master 3 subcompetencies had only four levels defined. RESULTS Milestone assessments for 2030 pediatric residents in 47 programs during academic year 2013-2014 were obtained. There was significant variation in end-of-year milestone ratings for residents within each level of training which decreased as training level increased. Most 78.9 434550 graduating third-year pediatric residents received a milestone rating of 3 in all 21 subcompetencies fewer 21.1 116550 received a rating of 4 in all subcompetencies. Across all training levels professionalism and interpersonal communication skills were rated highest quality improvement was rated lowest. CONCLUSIONS Trainees entered residency with a wide range of skills. As they advanced skill variability within a training level decreased. Most graduating pediatric residents were still advancing on the milestone continuum toward proficiency and mastery and an expectation of milestone ratings 4 in all categories upon graduation is unrealistic milestone ratings 3 upon graduation may be more realistic. Understanding current pediatric residents and graduates skills can help to identify key areas that should be specifically targeted during training.",

While there are families with rare highly penetrant mutations in CuZn superoxide dismutase 1 and several other genes that cause apparent Mendelian inheritance of the disease most ALS occurs in families without another affected individual. However twin studies suggest that all ALS has a substantial genetic basis. Herein we estimate the genetic contribution to ALS in a clinically ascertained case series from the United States. METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used the database of the Emory ALS Center to ascertain individuals with ALS along with their family histories to determine the concordance among parents and offspring for the disease. We found that concordance for all parent-offspring pairs was low 2. With this concordance we found that ALS heritability or the proportion of the disease explained by genetic factors is between 40 and 45 for all likely estimates of ALS lifetime prevalence. CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE We found the lifetime risk of ALS is 1.1 in first-degree relatives of those with ALS. Environmental and genetic factors appear nearly equally important for the development of ALS.",

Six dogs with histologically confirmed intracranial GCTs and MR imaging were included. Tumor location size mass effect T1- and T2-weighted signal intensity and peritumoral edema MR characteristics were recorded. In all dogs GCTs appeared as well-defined extra-axial masses with a plaque-form sessile distribution involving the meninges. All tumors were located along the convexity of the cerebrum the falx cerebri or the ventral floor of the cranial vault. All tumors were mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hyperintense on T2-weighted images. A moderate-to-severe degree of peritumoral edema and mass effect were evident in all dogs. Findings indicated that while several MR imaging characteristics were consistently identified in canine cerebral GCTs none of these characteristics were unique or distinctive for this tumor type alone.",

Following foliar 10B application to leaves of various ages there was significant 10B export out of the treated leaves and significant 10B enrichment in nontreated adjacent organs including inflorescences and fruit. Results demonstrated that B can be remobilized from leaves of various ages and that foliar-applied B is phloem mobile in olive. Soluble carbohydrate analysis determined that mannitol and glucose are the predominant sugars in all organs analyzed and that the mannitol concentration in the leaves is adequate to account for all B transport. This is consistent with observations in other species where the presence of mannitol is known to facilitate phloem B transport through formation of a mannitol-B complex. Previous reports have indicated that B application can alter carbohydrate metabolism. In the present study foliar B application significantly suppressed glucose concentration in the leaf petioles of all ages and increased mannitol in petioles of the current-year-developed leaves.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to examine trama surgeons practice patterns regarding immunization of splenic injury patients. METHODS Data were analyzed from surgeons responding to a survey sent to 557 adult trauma surgeons in the United States and Canada. The survey queried the timing and use of vaccinations in splenic injury patients. RESULTS Three hundred four 54.6 surgeons responded to the survey with 43 no longer active. Of the 261 active surgeons 99.2 immunize their splenectomized patients whereas 15.7 immunize those who undergo splenorrhaphy and 8.4 immunize those managed nonoperatively. Vaccines are administered anywhere from the immediate postoperative period to as long as 6 weeks later. All but two responding surgeons provide the pneumococcal vaccine 62.8 also advocate meningococcal vaccination 72.4 add the Haemophilus influenzae vaccine and 56.7 give all three. Thirteen of the responding surgeons reimplant splenic tissue most frequently in the omentum and in quantities varying from two slices to the entire spleen. Revaccination practices are extremely varied-ranging from nothing at all to annually-and seldom follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. CONCLUSION With the exception of immunizing splenectomized patients against pneumococcal infection little consensus exists among surgeons regarding the immunization of patients sustaining splenic injury.",

    "abstract": "Climate warming is expected to change the distribution and abundance of many species. Range shifts have been detected in a number of European taxa for which long-term government-initiated or organized-survey data are available. In North America well-organized long-term data needed to document such shifts are much less common. Opportunistic observations made by citizen scientist groups may be an excellent alternative to systematic surveys. From 1992 to 2010 19779 butterfly surveys were made by amateur naturalists in Massachusetts a geographically small state located at the convergence of northern and southern bioclimatic zones in eastern North America. From these data we estimated population trends for nearly all butterfly species 100 of 116 species present using list-length analysis. Population trajectories indicate increases of many species near their northern range limits and declines in nearly all species 17 of 21 near their southern range limits. Certain life-history traits especially overwintering stage were strongly associated with declines. Our results suggest that a major climate-induced shift of North American butterflies characterized by northward expansions of warm-adapted and retreat of cold-adapted species is underway. 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

These algorithms are based on the two-refinement templates introduced by Schneiders. However we introduce a novel technique to choose the appropriate refinement template locally. This enables efficient implementation of the proposed algorithms even in parallel. The proposed algorithms can handle refined regions of complicated geometry and do not suffer from concavity restrictions associated with the three-refinement methods currently dominating the literature. Several application examples show the strength of these new algorithms in problems that require fast dynamic remeshing such as computational fluid dynamics and computer graphics. 2011 John Wiley Sons Ltd.",

Using population-based data we describe where AYAs with ALL receive treatment and determine associations with overall survival OS. METHODS Data from the 2004 to 2018 California CA n 2283 New York NY n 795 and Texas TX n 955 state cancer registries were used to identify treatment setting of AYAs with newly diagnosed ALL. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated associations with OS. RESULTS Seventy percent were older than 18 years and 65 were male. A majority in CA 63 and TX 64 were Hispanic while most in NY were non-Hispanic White 50. Treatment at an SCC occurred in 48.2 CA 44.4 NY and 19.5 TX. Across states AYAs who were older or uninsured were less likely to receive treatment at an SCC. Treatment at an SCC was associated with superior OS in CA hazard ratio HR 0.73 95 CI 0.63 to 0.85 and TX HR 0.61 95 CI 0.45 to 0.83 a nonsignificant association was seen in NY HR 0.83 95 CI 0.64 to 1.08. CONCLUSION Only 20-50 of AYA patients with ALL received frontline treatment at SCCs. Treatment of ALL at an SCC was associated with superior survival highlighting the importance of policy efforts to improve access and reduce inequities in AYA ALL care.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Digital pathology is becoming an increasingly popular area of advancement in both research and clinically. Pathologists are now able to manage and interpret slides digitally as well as collaborate with external pathologists with digital copies of slides. Differences in slide scanners include variation in resolution image contrast and optical properties which may influence downstream image processing. This study tested the hypothesis that varying slide scanners would result in differences in computed pathomic features on prostate cancer whole mount slides. DESIGN This study collected 192 unique tissue slides from 30 patients following prostatectomy. Tissue samples were paraffin-embedded stained for hematoxylin and eosin HE and digitized using 3 different scanning microscopes at the highest available magnification rate for a total of 3 digitized slides per tissue slide. These scanners included a S1 Nikon microscope equipped with an automated sliding stage an S2 Olympus VS120 slide scanner and a S3 Huron TissueScope LE scanner. A color deconvolution algorithm was then used to optimize contrast by projecting the RGB image into color channels representing optical stain density. The resulting intensity standardized images were then computationally processed to segment tissue and calculate pathomic features including lumen stroma epithelium and epithelial cell density as well as second-order features including lumen area and roundness epithelial area roundness and wall thickness and cell fraction. For each tested feature mean values of that feature per digitized slide were collected and compared across slide scanners using mixed effect models fit to compare differences in the tested feature associated with all slide scanners for each slide including a random effect of subject with a nested random effect of slide to account for repeated measures. Similar models were also computed for tissue densities to examine how differences in scanner impact downstream processing. RESULTS Each mean color channel intensity i.e. Red Green Blue differed between slide scanners all P.001. Of the color deconvolved images only the hematoxylin channel was similar in all 3 scanners all P.05. Lumen and stroma densities between S3 and S1 slides and epithelial cell density between S3 and S2 P.05 were comparable but all other comparisons were significantly different P.05. The second-order features were found to be comparable for all scanner comparisons except for lumen area and epithelium area. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that both optical and computed properties of digitized histological samples are impacted by slide scanner differences. Future research is warranted to better understand which scanner properties influence the tissue segmentation process and to develop harmonization techniques for comparing data across multiple slide scanners.",

METHODS Using the population-based California Cancer Registry linked with California hospitalization data we evaluated late effects in 1069 AYAs aged 15-39 years diagnosed with ALL in California between 1995 and 2012 and surviving a minimum of 3 years from diagnosis. RESULTS The estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of subsequent endocrine disease 28.7 95 confidence interval CI 25.8 to 31.6 and cardiac disease 17.0 95 CI 14.6 to 19.5 were strikingly high avascular necrosis 9.6 95 CI 7.8 to 11.6 liver disease 6.5 95 CI 5.0 to 8.3 respiratory disease 6.2 95 CI 4.8 to 8.0 seizure andor stroke 4.3 95 CI 3.1 to 5.8 renal disease 3.1 95 CI 2.1 to 4.4 and second neoplasms 1.4 95 CI 0.7 to 2.4 were estimated to occur at 10 years with the reported frequencies. Multivariable analyses including the entire patient cohort demonstrated that public or no insurance vs private andor military insurance and receipt of hematopoietic cell transplantation were independently associated with the occurrence of all late effects considered. In multivariable analyses limited to the 766 AYAs who were not transplanted we continued to find a statistically significant association between public and no insurance and the occurrence of all late effects. Frontline regimen type pediatric vs adult was not statistically significantly associated with any of the late effect categories. CONCLUSIONS This large population-based analysis is among the first to describe late effects in survivors of AYA ALL. The strong association between insurance type and late effects suggests that AYAs with public or no insurance may have reduced access to survivorship care following completion of ALL therapy.",

The role of the Hh pathway in precursor B cell preB acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL the most common leukemia in children is unclear however recent reports suggest that Hh signaling is involved in the development of B cell precursors as well as the self-renewal and survival of B cell malignancies.jatsp jatspMXD3 is a transcription factor previously shown in our lab to be a novel member of the Hh pathway Yun Rust Ishimaru Diaz Mol Bio Cell 2007. We have previously shown that MXD3 is expressed in medulloblastoma the most common brain tumor in children and that its knockdown reduces proliferation of human medulloblastoma cell lines Barisone et al. PLoS 2012. In the current study we investigated a possible role for MXD3 in preB ALL cell proliferation. Using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR qRT-PCR we observed high levels of MXD3 mRNA expression in 8 primary preB ALL samples as well as in the preB ALL cell lines Reh and JM1. However MXD3 levels were very low in mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors mouse bone marrow and spleen. Indeed MXD3 levels in the primary ALL cells and cell lines ranged between 13 and 35 fold increase when compared to the normal cells. Immunoblot analysis with anti-MXD3 monoclonal antibodies confirmed that the protein was present in the ALL samples but not in normal cells. We investigated the role of MXD3 in cell proliferation and survival by silencing MXD3 in the Reh cell line. We used lentiviral delivery to knockdown MXD3 using an RNA interference approach. Briefly lentiviruses were produced carrying a short hairpin RNA sequence specific for MXD3 shMXD3 or a negative control sequence shCTRL. Upon transduction by the viral vector MXD3 knockdown was confirmed at both the RNA and protein level. Within 48 hours after transduction MXD3 protein levels were reduced gt90 in cells infected with the shMXD3 virus but not with the control virus. Interestingly MXD3 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation in Reh cells supporting our hypothesis that it may be involved in the maintenance of this malignancy. As a first step toward understanding the mechanisms by which MXD3 exerts its function in leukemia cells we analyzed cell cycle progression and apoptosis levels after knockdown using flow cytometry. We observed no significant differences in the G0G1 S or G2M populations between experimental and control samples. However samples where MXD3 had been knocked down showed higher levels of apoptosis when compared to controls.jatsp jatspTaken together our results suggest that MXD3 is important for preB ALL cell proliferation possibly by acting as an anti-apoptotic factor. Therefore MXD3 may represent a suitable candidate for future efforts in developing targeted therapies against preB ALL.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

Readmission rates also vary widely between hospitals but the reasons for this variation have not been studied previously. METHODS AND RESULTS We linked 2009 California CABG clinical registry data to hospital discharge data for 2009 and 2010 to identify 30-day readmissions for all patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Both standard and hierarchical logistic models were developed to predict readmission risk and explore sources of hospital readmission variation. Among 11 823 patients discharged alive after isolated CABG in 2009 1565 13.2 patients were readmitted within 30 days of surgery. Heart failure and postoperative infections were the most frequent reasons for readmission 15.3 and 12.9 respectively. Multiple patient risk factors including age sex and lower zip code-level median household income were significant predictors of readmission all adjusted odds ratios 1.0 P0.05. The readmission rates among the 119 hospitals performing CABG varied from 0 to 26.9. Compared with hospitals in lower quartiles for readmission hospitals in higher quartiles had a significantly higher readmission rates due to circulatory diseases infections complications for surgical and medical care and digestive diseases all P0.05. In a hierarchical model including several hospital characteristics hospital-level variables did not predict readmission risk all P0.05 with an intraclass correlation of 0.004 for hospitals. CONCLUSIONS California hospitals performing CABG surgery vary widely in 30-day readmission rates. Patient demographic and clinical risk factors rather than measured hospital characteristics accounted for most of the observed hospital-level variation in CABG readmissions.",

Undergraduate students at an emerging Hispanic serving R1 institution completed six Scientist Spotlights assignments in their physiology courses. We conducted semistructured interviews and disseminated an established pre- and postsurvey protocol at the beginning and end of the courses. Our findings from interviews with 31 students from a range of marginalized backgrounds revealed that 1 the biographical information about counterstereotypical scientists deeply resonated with students by humanizing science 2 the instructors implementation of the assignments made a meaningful difference in their feelings of inclusion and 3 the assignments supported students beliefs about their content learning and understanding of physiological concepts. The results from the survey showed that regardless of being in a major n 159 or nonmajor n 117 course students from a range of demographic groups can and do significantly shift in their relatability to and descriptions of scientists. We highlight implications for inclusive curricula like Scientist Spotlights for addressing the issue of representation in physiology textbooks curriculum and healthcare fields at large.NEW NOTEWORTHY Scientist Spotlights significantly enhance undergraduate students feelings of inclusion and learning in undergraduate physiology courses at an emerging Hispanic-serving institution. By engaging with assignments featuring counterstereotypical scientists students in both majors and nonmajors physiology courses shifted in their relatability to and descriptions of scientists. These results suggest that an inclusive curriculum combined with supportive instructor practices can positively impact student success and representation in physiology education.",

However LSCs have not yet been identified for acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL. Among many challenges lack of phenotypic markers is one of the major problems in identifying ALL LSCs. In this study we demonstrated a novel method to isolate LSCs from both T- and B- cell ALLs and further characterized their transcriptome profile at the single cell level.jatsp jatspWe have recently identified a novel method to isolate ALL LSCs based on cellular metabolic activities. We demonstrated that these isolated LSCs had in vivo leukemia-initiating capability LIC. We have developed a series of primary ALL xenograft mouse models using patient samples and NODSCIDIL2Rg-- NSG mice. Leukemia cells harvested from several generations of these mice were used in this study. We isolated LSCs and non-LSCs from 4 different B-cell type ALL samples and transplanted them separately into healthy NSG mice. Cell numbers used varied between 5 10 and 50000 per mouse and the number of the animals varied between three and eight per group. All the animals transplanted with LSCs developed leukemia between 5-14 weeks whereas those transplanted with non-LSCs did not develop the disease within the same timeframe or by the end of the study which was more than 4 months after leukemia development in the LSC group.jatsp jatspIn order to characterize and identify potential therapeutic targets in the LSCs we investigated the transcriptome profile of these cells. First we performed genomewide microarray gene expression profiling of RNA isolated from the LSCs and non-LSCs using 4 ALL cell lines Reh JM1 Jurkat and Molt4. There were 173 genes which showed at least 2-fold difference in gene expression between the LSCs and non-LSCs. Using a panel of primer sets for the 100 genes exhibiting the highest difference in expression we performed qRT-PCR for these genes in the isolated LSCs and non-LSCs from 11 primary ALL samples 10 B-cell and 1 T-cell type transplanted and harvested from our NSG xenograft mouse models at different generations. There was a distinct difference in the transcriptome profile between the LSCs and non-LSCs in these primary ALL samples. Overall gene expression of 93 LSC signature genes was much lower in the LSCs than in the non-LSCs.jatsp jatspRecent advances in microfluidic technologies allowed us to investigate cells at single cell resolution. Growing evidence suggests that cancer stem cells consist of heterogeneous cell populations subclones. Therefore we further investigated whether these isolated LSCs have subclones using the Fluidigm C1 and Biomark system. Preliminary results using a primary ALL sample harvested from our xenograft mouse model indicate that there are at least two distinct subclones in the LSCs based on principal component analysis of the single cell data.jatsp jatspIn summary we 1 developed a novel method to isolate ALL LSCs which have in vivo LIC 2 demonstrated that isolated LSCs have a distinct transcriptome profile and 3 discovered that the LSCs seem to consist of subclones. Currently we are in the process of performing detailed comprehensive transcriptome analyses and additional single cell transcriptome assays.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Multiple competing uses of continental-shelf environments have led to a proliferation of marine spatial planning initiatives together with expert guidance on marine spatial planning. This study provides an empirical review of marine spatial plans their attributes and the extent to which the expert guidance is actually being followed. We performed a structured review of 16 existing marine spatial plans and created an idealized marine spatial plan from the steps included in recent expert papers. A cluster analysis of the yesno answers to 28 questions was used to ordinate the 16 marine spatial plans and to compare them with the idealized plan. All the plans that have been implemented have a high-level government mandate and the authority to implement spatial planning vested in existing institutions. Almost all the plans used data with clear criteria for data inclusion. Stakeholders were included in almost all the plans they did not participate in all stages of the planning process but their roles were generally clearly defined. Decision-support tools were applied inconsistently across plans and were seldom used dynamically over time. Most spatial planning processes did not select specific outcomes such as preferred use scenarios. Success is defined inconsistently across plans in half the cases there are no metrics of success with reference benchmarks. Although monitoring is included in the majority of plans only in some cases do monitoring results feed back into management decisions. The process of marine spatial planning had advanced in that some of the more recent plans were developed more quickly and contain more desirable attributes than earlier plans. Even so existing marine spatial plans are heterogeneous-there are essential ingredients but no single recipe for success. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Recently we suggested a reformulation of general relativity which completely sequesters from gravity all of the vacuum energy from a protected matter sector assumed to contain the standard model. Here we elaborate further on the mechanism presenting additional details of how it cancels all loop corrections and renders all contributions from phase transitions automatically small. We also consider cosmological consequences in more detail and show that the mechanism is consistent with a variety of inflationary models that make a universe big and old. We discuss in detail the underlying assumptions behind the dynamics of our proposal and elaborate on the relationship of the physical interpretation of divergent operators in quantum field theory and the apparent acausality which our mechanism seems to entail which we argue is completely harmless. It is merely a reflection of the fact that any UV sensitive quantity in quantum field theory cannot be calculated from first principles but is an input whose numerical value must be measured. We also note that since the universe should be compact in spacetime and so will collapse in the future the current phase of acceleration with wDE-1 is just a transient. This could be tested by future cosmological observations.",

We used data from each persons last study visit to calibrate scores for memory executive function language and visuospatial functioning. We extracted item information functions for each domain and used these to calculate standard errors of measurement. We derived scores for each domain for each diagnostic group and plotted standard errors of measurement for the observed range of scores. RESULTS Across all waves there were 961 people with NC 825 people with MCI and 694 people with AD at their most recent study visit data pulled February 25 2019. Across ADNIs battery there were 34 memory items 18 executive function items 20 language items and seven visuospatial items. Scores for each domain were highest on average for people with NC intermediate for people with MCI and lowest for people with AD with most scores across all groups in the range of -1 to 1. Standard error of measurement in the range from -1 to 1 was highest for memory intermediate for language and executive functioning and lowest for visuospatial.

STUDY DESIGN Observational study. SAMPLE Radiographic images of 73 hip joints from 60 dogs with cementless cups. METHODS Radiographs were anonymized and measured independently by three observers. One observer measured 12 sets of radiographs three times. A best-fit acetabular circle AC and cranial-caudal acetabular line AL were measured on ventral-dorsal VD radiographic view and open leg lateral OLL view. A best-fit femoral head circle FHC was measured on VD OLL and craniocaudal horizontal beam CCHB views. Two observers scored the OA in each hip joint. Intra- and interobserver consistency and repeatability and bias relative to implanted cup size were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS Intraobserver consistency and repeatability were excellent for all measurements. Interobserver consistency was excellent ICC 0.9 for ACVD and ACOLL and was good 0.75 ICC 0.9 for all other methods. Bias was small for AC and AL measurements range -0.46 to 0.45 mm and large for FHC measurements -3.58 to -2.42 mm. OA score significantly influenced bias for all acetabular measurement methods p 0.05. CONCLUSION All acetabular measurement methods were highly consistent within an observer. Interobserver consistency was highest for ACVD and ACOLL. FHC measurements underestimated cup size. Higher OA scores decreased the accuracy of all acetabular measurement methods.

Seven distinct repetitive DNA elements were isolated from a 75-kilobase rice bacterial artificial chromosome clone. All seven DNA elements are present in every rice centromere as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Six of the elements are middle repetitive and their copy numbers range from approximately 50 to approximately 300 in the rice genome. Five of these six middle repetitive DNA elements are present in all of the Gramineae species and the other element is detected only in species within the Bambusoideae subfamily of Gramineae.

The seventh element the RCS2 family is a tandem repeat of a 168-bp sequence that is represented approximately 6000 times in the rice genome and is detected only in Oryza species. Fiber-fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the RCS2 family is organized into long uninterrupted arrays and resembles previously reported tandem repeats located in the centromeres of human and Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recent anatomic studies have failed to demonstrate a single utilitarian approach to intraoperative identification and surgical release of all 5 potential sites of posterior interosseous nerve PIN compression in the radial tunnel. This study examines if a single incision brachioradialis-splitting approach without the use of additional anatomic windows is capable of adequately exposing the entire length of the radial tunnel including all 5 sites of PIN compression to allow for adequate release. METHODS Ten fresh frozen cadaver forearms 6 female 4 male were dissected utilizing a curvilinear 7 cm incision over the brachioradialis. The muscle belly was split via simple blunt retraction exposing the radial tunnel. The PIN was identified and mobilized at 5 compression sites radiocapitellar joint RCJ radial recurrent vessels Leash of Henry fibrous medioproximal edge of extensor carpe radialis brevis arcade of Frohse and distal edge of supinator. RESULTS The PIN was identified and effectively released in all specimens without difficulty from this single approach. All 5 sites of compression were visible and accessible through the brachioradialis-split approach. Specifically there was no difficulty in identifying and releasing the PIN at the distal edge of supinator. CONCLUSIONS Radial tunnel syndrome is defined as PIN compression within the radial tunnel spanning from the fibrous RCJ to the distal edge of the supinator. A single brachioradialis-splitting approach is adequate for complete visualization and release of all compression sites of the radial tunnel. Utilizing this technique allows for surgical access and ease as well as minimizing necessity for additional windows or multiple incisions.",

    "abstract": "Entrywise powers of symmetric matrices preserving positivity monotonicity or convexity with respect to the Loewner ordering arise in various applications and have received much attention recently in the literature. Following FitzGerald and Horn 1977 8 it is well-known that there exists a critical exponent beyond which all entrywise powers preserve positive definiteness. Similar phenomena have also recently been shown by Hiai 2009 to occur for monotonicity and convexity. In this paper we complete the characterization of all the entrywise powers below and above the critical exponents that are positive monotone or convex on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. We then extend the original problem by fully classifying the positive monotone or convex powers in a more general setting where additional rank constraints are imposed on the matrices. We also classify the entrywise powers that are supersub-additive with respect to the Loewner ordering. Finally we extend all the previous characterizations to matrices with negative entries. Our analysis consequently allows us to answer a question raised by Bhatia and Elsner 2007 regarding the smallest dimension for which even extensions of the power functions do not preserve Loewner positivity.",

The purpose of this study is to examine our urine drug screening practices.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleMethodsjatstitle jatspFollowing IRB approval a retrospective chart review was conducted using electronic medical records of all adult patients admitted to the burn center from 20162018. Data collected included information on the burn injury drug screening and demographics. Due to the fact that many patients receive opioids and benzodiazepines for pain and anxiety related to their burn injury these were not considered positive if present on drug screen without gas chromatography to confirm use. Data analysis was conducted using chi-square t-test and logistic regression models.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleResultsjatstitle jatspA total of 1134 patients mean age 45.9 17.3 years 855 males 75.4 mean burn size TBSA 12.115.5 were analyzed.

Using APF phase-shifters allows a large phase shift with an actuation range of only tens of nanometers. The ultrathin HCG further ensures a high tuning speed 0.626 MHz.

The order of visual injury ratings was 24-D ester 24-D amine picloram dicamba fluroxypyr triclopyr clopyralid. By 56 DAT slight injury symptoms were observed on plants treated with all herbicides except all rates of 24-D from which symptoms were severe. All rates of 24-D and the highest rate of picloram caused more than 60 flower abortion. Ranking of fiber yield reduction after herbicide treatment was 24-D ester 24-D amine picloram fluroxypyr dicamba clopyralid triclopyr. This research demonstrated that cotton is extremely susceptible to simulated drift rates of 24-D and picloram whereas clopyralid and triclopyr caused early injury with minimal effect on cotton yield.",

However urethral obstruction secondary to AUS-associated capsule formation has been described rarely. HYPOTHESIS Describe clinical and diagnostic findings management and outcome in 6 dogs with urethral obstruction secondary to AUS-associated capsule formation. ANIMALS Six client-owned dogs. METHODS Retrospective study. Medical records between January 1 2010 and June 30 2021 were reviewed to identify dogs with urethral obstruction associated with the AUS device. RESULTS The AUS device was implanted a median of 884 days range 20-2457 days before presentation for urethral obstruction. Median age at time of urethral obstruction was 4.7 years range 3.1-8.7 years. Clinical signs at the time of urethral obstruction were stranguria n 4 pollakiuria 3 weak urine stream 2 and worsened urinary incontinence 1. In all dogs the urethra was noted to be stenotic during urethroscopy and positive contrast cystourethrography. All dogs underwent surgery and a fibrous capsule associated with the AUS was found to be causing urethral stenosis. Resolution of urethral obstruction occurred in all dogs after transection or removal of the capsule. Positive bacterial cultures were obtained from the capsule AUS or both in all dogs. Recurrence of urethral obstruction had not occurred in any dog at the time of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Urethral obstruction secondary to capsule formation is an uncommon but clinically important complication associated with use of the AUS. Continued investigation is needed to evaluate this complication more thoroughly and its possible association with infection.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized study. ANIMALS Mature female hound dogs n 6. METHODS Physical examination baseline blood work and thoracic radiography confirmed the absence of preexisting disease in all dogs. Thoracoscopic observation was established through a subxiphoid portal and used for evaluation of differential lung lobe ventilation. Each dog was sequentially intubated using 1 of 3 DLT designs in random order Robertshaw left-sided tube RS-L Carlens left-sided tube C-L Dr. White right-sided tube DW-R. Incidence of initial and overall after a maximum of 3 DLT manipulations correct and complete OLV CC-OLV was recorded. After each blind thoracoscopic-assisted DLT placement bronchoscopic evaluation was performed to document correct DLT position. RESULT Blind DLT placement achieved overall CC-OLV in all dogs using RS-L 66 using C-L and all using DW-R. Successful initial left-sided OLV L-OLV was statistically more likely when RS-L DLTs were used compared to C-L or DW-R. Of cases where overall CC-OLV was achieved correct DLT position was present in only 44 of intubations. CONCLUSIONS Blind DLT placement produced successful CC-OLV in all dogs using at least one DLT design evaluated. Use of thoracoscopic assistance may obviate the need for bronchoscopic observation during DLT placement in dogs. However bronchoscopic observation may still refine DLT positioning in dogs after blind thoracoscopic-assisted DLT placement.",

Ten genetic types were detected by use of RAPD PCR assay types III to X were isolated from horses cattle or both in 1 or more states. Types III and IX were isolated from both horses and cattle. Types VII and VIII were isolated in only 1 state but the number of isolates in these groups was small. In contrast all other types were isolated in 2 or more states. All isolates from Utah were type III but the other 3 states had isolates from more than 1 type. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE These data are consistent with a clonally expanding epidemic of infection in Utah and an increase in number of infections caused by multiple strains of C pseudotuberculosis not derived from a single source in the other states. The increase in number of infections could be the result of reporting bias environmental factors facilitating infection or host factors such as greater herd susceptibility.",

Elucidating the neurobiological patterns that specifically characterize SI and NSSI in adolescents is needed to inform the use of these markers in intervention studies and to develop brain-based treatment targets. Here we clinically assessed 70 adolescents-49 adolescents with depression and 21 healthy controls-to determine SI and NSSI history. Twenty-eight of the depressed adolescents had a history of SI and 29 had a history of NSSI 20 overlapping. All participants underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. We compared groups in network coherence of subdivisions of the central executive network CEN default mode network DMN and salience network SN. We also examined group differences in between-network connectivity and explored brain-behavior correlations. Depressed adolescents with SI and with NSSI had lower coherence in the ventral DMN compared to those without SI or NSSI respectively and healthy controls all ps 0.043 uncorrected. Depressed adolescents with NSSI had lower coherence in the anterior DMN and in insula-SN all ps 0.030 uncorrected and higher CEN-DMN connectivity compared to those without NSSI and healthy controls all ps 0.030 uncorrected. Lower network coherence in all DMN subnetworks and insula-SN were associated with higher past-month SI and NSSI all ps 0.001 uncorrected. Thus in our sample both SI and NSSI are related to brain networks associated with difficulties in self-referential processing and future planning while NSSI specifically is related to brain networks associated with disruptions in interoceptive awareness.",

To identify the complicated structure of these networks we propose a methodology for analyzing large multiple time-series data sets arising in expression analysis and evaluate it both theoretically and through a case study. We first build a graph representing all putative activationinhibition relationships between all pairs of genes and then prune this graph by solving a combinatorial optimization problem to identify a small set of interesting candidate regulatory elements. We implemented this method and applied it into a real data set. For this particular model we present several algorithmic and complexity results for the maximum gene regulation problem to identify the smallest set of genes that regulate all genes.",

In the present study Pb2 cleavage patterns were identified for ribonuclease P RNAs from three phylogenetically disparate organisms Escherichia coli Chromatium vinosum Bacillus subtilis and for E. coli RNase P RNAs that had been altered by deletions. Each of the native RNAs undergoes cleavage at several sites in the core structure that is common to all bacterial RNase P RNAs. All the cleavages occur in non-paired regions of the secondary structure models of the RNAs in regions likely to be involved in tertiary interactions. Two cleavage sites occur at homologous positions in all the native RNAs regardless of sequence variation suggesting common tertiary structural features. The Pb2 cleavage sites in four deletion mutants of E. coli RNase P RNA differed from the native pattern indicating alterations in the tertiary structures of the mutant RNAs. This conclusion is consistent with previously characterized properties of the mutant RNAs. The Pb2 cleavage assay is thus a useful probe to reveal alteration of tertiary structure in RNase P RNA.",

Forty foals born on the same breeding farm were diagnosed with suspected clinical EPE between September 2019 and January 2020. Data of these cases were analyzed retrospectively regarding the course of the disease treatment outcome and long-term prognosis. All horses including randomly selected control horses were reassessed about nine months after the suspicion of EPE. The horses affected were between 5 and 10 months of age. Fever was the most common clinical sign. Hypoproteinemia was shown consistently in all cases. Seroconversion was detected in all horses affected while fecal shedding of Lawsonia intracellularis via qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was only found in 21 cases. Treatment was based on tetracyclines and the administration of equine plasma IV. A total of 39 of 40 foals survived EPE. No long-term effects in terms of poor body condition or abnormal blood values were observed. If diagnosed and treated early EPE can generally be described as a disease with a good prognosis and no long-term effects in Warmblood horses.",

    "abstract": "PROBLEM Utility All-Terrain Vehicles ATVs are one major cause of youth injuries and fatalities on farms. Utility ATVs have heavy weights and fast speeds that require complex maneuvering. Youths physical capabilities may not be sufficient to perform those complex maneuvers correctly. Therefore it is hypothesized that most youth engage in ATV-related incidents because they ride vehicles unfit for them. There is a need to assess ATV-youth fit based on youth anthropometry. METHOD This study focused on evaluating potential inconsistencies between the operational requirements of utility ATVs and the anthropometric measures of youth through virtual simulations. Virtual simulations were performed to assess 11 youth-ATV fit guidelines proposed by several ATV safety advocacy organizations National 4-H council CPSC IPCH and FReSH. In total 17 utility ATVs along with male-and-female-youth of nine ages 8 to 16 years old and three height percentiles 5th 50th and 95th were evaluated. RESULTS The results demonstrated a physical mismatch between ATVs operational requirements and youths anthropometry. For example male-youth aged 16 of the 95th height percentile failed to pass at least 1 out of the 11 fit guidelines for 35 of all vehicles evaluated. The results were even more concerning for females. Female youth 10 years old and younger from all height percentiles failed to pass at least one fit guideline for all ATVs evaluated. DISCUSSION Youth are not recommended to ride utility ATVs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This study provides quantitative and systematic evidence to modify current ATV safety guidelines. Furthermore youth occupational health professionals could use the present findings to prevent ATV-related incidents in agricultural settings.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Coagulopathy is present in 25 to 38 of trauma patients on arrival to the hospital and these patients are four times more likely to die than trauma patients without coagulopathy. Recently a high ratio of fresh frozen plasma FFP to packed red blood cells PRBCs has been shown to decrease mortality in massively transfused trauma patients. Therefore we hypothesized that patients with elevated International Normalized Ratio INR on arrival to the hospital may benefit more from transfusion with a high ratio of FFPPRBC than those with a lower INR. METHODS Retrospective multicenter cohort study of 437 massively transfused trauma patients was conducted to determine whether the effect of the ratio of FFPPRBC on death at 24 hours is modified by a patients admission INR on arrival to the hospital. Contingency tables and logistic regression were used. RESULTS Trauma patients who arrived to the hospital with an elevated INR had a greater risk of death than those with a lower INR. However as the ratio of FFPPRBC transfused increased mortality decreased similarly between the INR quartiles. CONCLUSIONS The mortality benefit from a high FFPPRBC ratio is similar for all massively transfused trauma patients. This is contrary to the current belief that only coagulopathic trauma patients benefit from a high FFPPRBC ratio. Furthermore it is unnecessary to determine whether INR is elevated before transfusing a high FFPPRBC ratio. Future studies are needed to determine the mechanism by which a high FFPPRBC ratio decreases mortality in all massively transfused trauma patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Although cigarette smoking remains the most common risk factor for heart disease among the young few studies have explored the relationship of smoking with heart disease mortality risk among young people. This prospective study assesses the risk and burden of all heart disease HD and coronary heart disease CHD mortality associated with smoking among younger adults from a nationally representative sample of the United States. METHOD National Health Interview Survey respondents data from 1997-2004 were linked to their death records through 2006. The analyses were restricted to individuals 18 to 44 years of age during follow up n 121284. Cox proportional hazard ratios HR were estimated with adjustment for sample weights and design effects. Attributable fractions AF of smoking were calculated. RESULTS After controlling for age race body mass index history of hypertension and diabetes and leisure time physical activity current smoking related CHD mortality HR was 14.6 95 confidence interval or CI 3.3-64.9 for females and 3.6 95 CI 1.2-10.4 for males. The HR for all HD mortality was 3.1 95 CI 1.3-7.6 for females and 2.4 95 CI 1.2-4.7 for males. The AF of smoking for CHD deaths for female and male were 0.58 and 0.54 respectively. The AF of all HD mortality was 0.31 for male and 0.32 for female. The mean estimates of all HD deaths attributable to smoking during 1997-2006 among this age group were 52214 of which 45147 were CHD deaths. CONCLUSION Even after adjustment for multiple risk factors and without addressing passive smoking our result showed a strong relationship between smoking and HD and CHD mortality among young adults that is likely causal.",

    "abstract": "In the polluted bootstrap percolation model the vertices of a graph are independently declared initially occupied with probability p or closed with probability q. At subsequent steps a vertex becomes occupied if it is not closed and it has at least r occupied neighbors. On the cubic lattice Zd of dimension d 3 with threshold r 2 we prove that the final density of occupied sites converges to 1 as p and q both approach 0 regardless of their relative scaling. Our result partially resolves a conjecture of Morris and contrasts with the d 2 case where Gravner and McDonald proved that the critical parameter is q p2.",

    "abstract": "Research into all optical network AON technology has been ongoing over the past decade and new features are constantly being developed. The advantages of AON include large-bandwidth provisioning lowlatency transmission and low energy consumption. The basic concept underlying AON is transmission of data signals entirely through the optical domain from source to destination nodes with no optical-electrical-optical O-E-O conversion at intermediate nodes. The technologies used to implement AON have undergone a series of evolutions which encompass time division multiplexing TDM frequency division multiplexing FDM and space division multiplexing SDM. Multi-dimensional AON MD-AON which leads the trend of AONs future architecture provides a vibrant state for emerging applications such as cloud computing and Internet of Things IoT. In this article we review the evolution of AON architectures based on the different all optical switching and multiplexing technologies i.e. TDM FDM and SDM which is one of the main areas of focus in this article. The other main area is detailed discussion of implementations such as data plane and control plane technologies as well as resource optimization technologies for realizing AON. We also introduce several AON testbeds with their compositions and functions and some potential application scenarios that can be implemented based on these testbeds",

Distal tubular lesions were present in all 16 animals and unique polarizable crystals with striations were present in distal tubules or collecting ducts in all animals. The proximal tubules were largely unaffected. Crystals and histologic appearance were identical in both outbreaks. A chronic pattern of histologic change characterized by interstitial fibrosis and inflammation was observed in some affected animals.

    "abstract": "Aural plaques affect at least 22 of horses and can be asymptomatic or cause ear sensitivity. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy studies have shown a strong association between aural plaques and papilloma virus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of imiquimod 5 cream an immune response modifier with potent antiviral activity in the treatment of equine aural plaques. Twenty-one horses were enrolled and 16 completed the study. Imiquimod 5 cream was applied three times a week every other week. When both ears were affected only the worst affected ear was treated. Adverse effects in all horses included marked local inflammation exudation and thick crust formation at the site of treatment and the adjacent skin. Removal of the crust before treatment was painful and required sedation in most horses. Complete resolution of lesions was noted in all horses immediately post-treatment and the long-term resolution rate was 87.5. Duration of therapy ranged from 1.5 to 8 months median 2.9 mean 3.5. All horses were followed-up for 12-22 months after treatment was discontinued and only two horses had a recurrence of lesions. Clinical signs related to the aural plaques prior to treatment were reported in 11 of 16 68.8 horses and included resistance to touching the ears and bridling. Complete resolution of these signs was reported by the owners in all of the horses followed-up for at least 12 months. In conclusion the topical application of imiquimod 5 cream is an efficacious treatment for aural plaques in horses.",

    "abstract": "Our computational developments and analyses on experimental images are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of chemical spraying via unmanned aerial vehicle UAV. Our evaluations are in accord with the two perspectives of color-complexity color variety within a color system and color distributional geometry on an image. First by working within RGB and HSV color systems we develop a new color-identification algorithm relying on highly associative relations among three color-coordinates to lead us to exhaustively identify all targeted color-pixels. A color-dot is then identified as one isolated network of connected color-pixel. All identified color-dots vary in shapes and sizes within each image. Such a pixel-based computing algorithm is shown robustly and efficiently accommodating heterogeneity due to shaded regions and lighting conditions. Secondly all color-dots with varying sizes are categorized into three categories. Since the number of small color-dot is rather large we spatially divide the entire image into a 2D lattice of rectangular. As such each rectangle becomes a collective of color-dots of various sizes and is classified with respect to its color-dots intensity. We progressively construct a series of minimum spanning trees MST as multiscale 2D distributional spatial geometries in a decreasing-intensity fashion. We extract the distributions of distances among connected rectangle-nodes in the observed MST and simulated MSTs generated under the spatial uniformness assumption. We devise a new algorithm for testing 2D spatial uniformness based on a Hierarchical clustering tree upon all involving MSTs. This new tree-based p-value evaluation has the capacity to become exact.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In the last 4 years four novel oral anticoagulants have been developed as alternatives to warfarin and antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation AF patients. The objective of this review was to estimate the comparative effectiveness of all antithrombotic treatments for AF patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data sources were Medline Ovid 1946 to October 2015 Embase Ovid 1980 to October 2015 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL Issue 9 2015. Randomized controlled trials of AF patients were selected if they compared at least two of the following placebo aspirin aspirin and clopidogrel combination therapy adjusted-dose warfarin target international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0 dabigatran rivaroxaban apixaban and edoxaban. Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted for outcomes of interest all stroke ischemic stroke myocardial infarction overall mortality major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS Based on 16 randomized controlled trials of 96826 patients all oral anticoagulants were more effective than antiplatelet agents at reducing the risk of ischemic stroke and all strokes. Compared to warfarin dabigatran 150 mg rate ratio 0.65 95 credible interval 0.52-0.82 and apixaban rate ratio 0.82 95 credible interval 0.69-0.97 reduced the risk of all strokes. Dabigatran 150 mg was also more effective than warfarin at reducing ischemic stroke risk rate ratio 0.76 95 credible interval 0.59-0.99. Aspirin apixaban dabigatran 110 mg and edoxaban were associated with less major bleeding than warfarin. CONCLUSION All oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in AF patients. Some novel oral anticoagulants are associated with a lower stroke andor major bleeding risk than warfarin. In addition to the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy as reported in this study individual treatment recommendations should also consider the patients underlying stroke and bleeding risk profile.",

Current probes around the Milky Way MW are most sensitive to such substructure within 20 kpc of the halo centre where the galaxy contributes significantly to the potential.We explore the effects of baryons on subhalo populations in CDM using cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations of MW-mass haloes from the Latte simulation suite part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments FIRE project. Specifically we compare simulations of the same two haloes run using 1 DM-only DMO 2 full baryonic physics and 3 DM with an embedded disc potential grown to match the FIRE simulation. Relative to baryonic simulations DMO simulations contain 2 as many subhaloes within 100 kpc of the halo centre this excess is 5 within 25 kpc. At z 0 the baryonic simulations are completely devoid of subhaloes down to 3 106M within 15 kpc of the MW-mass galaxy and fewer than 20 surviving subhaloes have orbital pericentres 20 kpc. Despite the complexities of baryonic physics the simple addition of an embedded central disc potential to DMO simulations reproduces this subhalo depletion including trends with radius remarkably well. Thus the additional tidal field from the central galaxy is the primary cause of subhalo depletion. Subhaloes on radial orbits that pass close to the central galaxy are preferentially destroyed causing the surviving population to have tangentially biased orbits compared to DMO predictions. Our method of embedding a potential in DMO simulations provides a fast and accurate alternative to full baryonic simulations thus enabling suites of cosmological simulations that can provide accurate and statistical predictions of substructure populations.",

The first member of this family encoded by the cruA gene of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum was identified in a complementation assay with a lycopene-producing strain of Escherichia coli. Orthologs of cruA are found in all available green sulfur bacterial genomes and in all cyanobacterial genomes that lack genes encoding CrtL- or CrtY-type lycopene cyclases. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 has two homologs of CruA denoted CruA and CruP and both were shown to have lycopene cyclase activity. Although all characterized lycopene cyclases in plants are CrtL-type proteins genes orthologous to cruP also occur in plant genomes. The CruA- and CruP-type carotenoid cyclases are members of the FixC dehydrogenase superfamily and are distantly related to CrtL- and CrtY-type lycopene cyclases. Identification of these cyclases fills a major gap in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways of green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Hypocotyl elongation in germinating lettuce Lactuca sativa L. cv. Diana M2 seedlings from an ethyl methanesulfonate treated population was used to select lines that were less sensitive to ethylene C2H4 than the progenitor line. Individuals were identified that had hypocotyls at least twice as long in the presence of hormonal C2H4 levels 1 l l-1 as wild-type plants. This phenotype was confirmed in M3 seedlings for three independent mutants. The phenotype was normal in terms of growth for the mutant lines so there were no obvious confounding growth defects or effect of other induced mutations. Changes in response to C2H4 and wounding chlorophyll loss induced respiration induced phenylalanine ammonia-lyase PAL activity in mature heads of lettuce were variable among the three mutant lines. Selection for C2H4 insensitivity at the seedling stage did not produce mature plants that were consistently less sensitive to C2H4-induced increases in PAL activity or CO2 production. However all the selected mutated plants did have lower rates of C2H4-induced chlorophyll loss. All of the mutants differed from the wild-type in at least 3 of the 7 phenotypes measured while one line differed in all the measured phenotypes. The apparent random distribution of induced changes observed in the mutant lines suggests that screening additional mutants may identify lines that combine a number of useful horticultural traits. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "abstract": "Traditional burn mortality models are derived using all age groups. We hypothesized that age variably impacts mortality after burn and that age-specific models for children adults and seniors will more accurately predict mortality than an all-ages model. We audited data from the American Burn Association ABA National Burn Repository NBR from 2000 to 2009 and used mixed effect logistic regression models to assess the influence of age total body surface area TBSA burn and inhalation injury on mortality. Mortality models were constructed for all ages and age-specific models children 18 years adults 18-60 years and seniors 60 years. Model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating curve AUC. Main effect and two-way interactions were used to construct age-group specific mortality models. Each age-specific model was compared to the All Ages model. Of 286293 records 100051 had complete data. Overall mortality was 4 but varied by age 17 seniors 1 children. Age TBSA and inhalation injury were significant mortality predictors for all models p0.05. Differences in predicted mortality between the All Ages model and the age-specific models occurred in children and seniors. In the age-specific pediatric model predicted mortality decreased with age inhalation injury had greater effect on mortality than in the All Ages model. In the senior model mortality increased with age. Seniors had greater increase in mortality per 1 increment in burn size and 1 year increase in age than other ages. The predicted mortality in seniors using the senior-specific model was higher than in the All Ages model. One size fits all models for predicting burn outcomes do not accurately reflect the outcomes for seniors and children. Age-specific models for children and seniors may be advisable.",

Study of 162 individuals identified 134 HLA class I alleles 41 HLA-A 60 HLA-B and 33 HLA-C. Common to all populations are three HLA-C alleles C1C0701 C1C0702 and C2C0602 but no HLA-A or -B Unexpectedly no novel HLA class I was identified in these previously unstudied and anthropologically distinctive populations. In contrast of 227 KIR detected 22 are present in all seven populations and 28 are novel. A high diversity of HLA A-C-B haplotypes was observed. In six populations most haplotypes are represented just once. But in the Hadza a majority of haplotypes occur more than once with 2 having high frequencies and 10 having intermediate frequencies. The centromeric cen part of the KIR locus exhibits an even balance between cenA and cenB in all seven populations. The telomeric tel part has an even balance of telA to telB in East Africa but this changes across the continent to where telB is vestigial in West Africa. All four KIR ligands A311 Bw4 C1 and C2 are present in six of the populations. HLA haplotypes of the Iraqw and Hadza encode two KIR ligands whereas the other populations have an even balance between haplotypes encoding one and two KIR ligands. Individuals in these African populations have a mean of 6.8-8.4 different interactions between KIR and HLA class I compared with 2.9-6.5 for non-Africans.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new-generation Amber united-atom force field for simulations involving highly demanding conformational sampling such as protein folding and protein-protein binding. In the new united-atom force field all hydrogens on aliphatic carbons in all amino acids are united with carbons except those on Calpha. Our choice of explicit representation of all protein backbone atoms aims at minimizing perturbation to protein backbone conformational distributions and to simplify development of backbone torsion terms. Tests with dipeptides and solvated proteins show that our goal is achieved quite successfully. The new united-atom force field uses the same new RESP charging scheme based on B3LYPcc-pVTZHF6-31g quantum mechanical calculations in the PCM continuum solvent as that in the Duan et al. force field. van der Waals parameters are empirically refitted starting from published values with respect to experimental solvation free energies of amino acid side-chain analogues. The suitability of mixing new point charges and van der Waals parameters with existing Amber covalent terms is tested on alanine dipeptide and is found to be reasonable. Parameters for all new torsion terms are refitted based on the new point charges and the van der Waals parameters. Molecular dynamics simulations of three small globular proteins in the explicit TIP3P solvent are performed to test the overall stability and accuracy of the new united-atom force field. Good agreements between the united-atom force field and the Duan et al. all-atom force field for both backbone and side-chain conformations are observed. In addition the per-step efficiency of the new united-atom force field is demonstrated for simulations in the implicit generalized Born solvent. A speedup around two is observed over the Duan et al. all-atom force field for the three tested small proteins. Finally the efficiency gain of the new united-atom force field in conformational sampling is further demonstrated with a well-known toy protein folding system an 18 residue polyalanine in distance-dependent dielectric. The new united-atom force field is at least a factor of 200 more efficient than the Duan et al. all-atom force field for ab initio folding of the tested peptide.",

HYPOTHESISOBJECTIVES Report the outcome of male dogs presented for urinary incontinence with UD treated with an artificial urethral sphincter AUS. ANIMALS Eight client-owned dogs with UD treated with an AUS. METHODS Multicenter retrospective study. Medical records from male dogs with urinary incontinence were reviewed. INCLUSION CRITERIA diagnosis of a UD by retrograde cystourethrography cystoscopy abdominal ultrasonography or contrast computed tomodensitometry CT or a combination of these modalities AUS placement and at least 1 follow-up. Urinary continence score UCS was attributed retrospectively. RESULTS Median UCS at presentation was 15. A contrast cystourethrogram was diagnostic in 88 dogs. All diverticula were saccular and 78 were within the prostatic urethra and 18 extended up to the membranous urethra. A congenital origin was suspected in 7 dogs and acquired in 1. Concurrent anomalies included renal dysplasia or chronic pyelonephritis n 4 bilateral cryptorchidism n 3 and pelvic urinary bladder n 3. All dogs were poorlymoderately responsive to phenylpropanolamine. Artificial urethral sphincter placement resulted in improvement in continence in all dogs with a median UCS of 45 55 in 28 dogs 45 in 58 dogs 35 in 18 dogs. CONCLUSION Urethral diverticulum should be considered in male dogs with persistent urinary incontinence not responding to medical management. Artificial urethral sphincter placement is an effective therapeutic option that improved continence scores in all dogs.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Risk adjustment is an important component of quality assessment in surgical health care. However data collection places an additional burden on physicians. There is also concern that outcomes can be gamed depending on the information recorded for each patient. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a number of machine-collected data elements could perform as well as a traditional full-risk adjustment model that includes other physician-assessed and physician-recorded data elements. DESIGN SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS All general surgery patients from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from January 1 2005 to December 31 2010 were included. Separate multivariate logistic regressions were performed using either all 66 preoperative risk variables or only 25 objective variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC of each regression using objective preoperative risk variables was compared with its corresponding regression with all preoperative variables. Subset analyses were performed among patients who received certain operations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality or any surgical complication captured by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program both inpatient and within 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS Data from a total of 745 053 patients were included. More than 15.8 of patients had at least 1 complication and the mortality rate was 2.8. When examining inpatient mortality the AUC was 0.9104 with all 66 variables vs 0.8918 with all 25 objective variables. The difference in AUC comparing models with all variables with objective variables ranged from -0.0073 to 0.1944 for mortality and 0.0198 to 0.0687 for complications. In models predicting mortality the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair pancreatic resection colectomy and appendectomy. In models predicting complications the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with pancreatic resection laparoscopic cholecystectomy colectomy and appendectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rigorous risk-adjusted surgical quality assessment can be performed solely with objective variables. By leveraging data already routinely collected for patient care this approach allows for wider adoption of quality assessment systems in health care. Identifying data elements that can be automatically collected can make future improvements to surgical outcomes and quality analyses.",

Overall across all eight series references to sexual interest were most common followed by references to sexual behavior. References to the risk and negative consequences of sex and references to sexual precaution seldomly occurred. Rape was the most frequently occurring term related to sex followed by the term kiss. As for each individual series analyses revealed distinct patterns of the specific categories of sex referenced. In general these findings offer an overview on the different types of sex content referenced in Netflix-originated adolescent series and suggest that adolescents may potentially be affected differently upon exposure to different patterns of sex references in these series.",

Methods Survey study performed at an urban university Level I trauma medical center. Results A total of 80 nurses 39 residents and 45 faculty completed the survey. All groups agreed that meth was a significant problem nationwide and in our emergency department ED. Nurses estimated that 33 of their patients used meth which differed from residents 18 and faculty 15. All agreed that these patients required more effort to care for utilized more hospital resources and were more often violent toward staff. Nurses reported higher prevalence of actual assault by patients using meth 70 than did residents 36 and faculty 47 and total lifetime number of assaults. All agreed that patients using meth appropriated prehospital resources at a higher rate than nonusers had a higher rate of recidivism and longer ED length of stay. Nurses preferred antipsychotics over benzodiazepines for treatment of meth-induced tachycardia and a lower threshold for treatment of associated hypertension than residents and faculty. For treatment of hypertension nurses preferred beta-blockers and hydralazine over benzodiazepines. Conclusion All agreed that meth use is a serious problem in our ED with high resource utilization recidivism and violence against staff. Nurses experienced higher rates of assaults by patients using meth and differed with regard to their disposition and treatment. Treatment guidelines strategies to mitigate violence towards staff and interprofessional education may be beneficial as the stakes of caring for these patients are high and preferences vary between caregivers.",

    "abstract": "New productive niches can offer new commercial perspectives linked to donkeys products and human therapeutic or leisure applications. However no assessment for selection criteria has been carried out yet. First we assessed the animal inherent features and environmental factors that may potentially influence several cognitive processes in donkeys. Then we aimed at describing a practical methodology to quantify such cognitive processes seeking their inclusion in breeding and conservation programmes through a multifactorial linear model. Sixteen cognitive process-related traits were scored on a problem-solving test in a sample of 300 Andalusian donkeys for three consecutive years from 2013 to 2015. The linear model assessed the influence and interactions of four environmental factors sex as an animal-inherent factor age as a covariable and the interactions between these factors. Analyses of variance were performed with GLM procedure of SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 24.0 software to assess the relative importance of each factor. All traits were significantly P0.05 affected by all factors in the model except for sex that was not significant for some of the cognitive processes and stimulus which was not significant P0.05 for all of them except for the coping style related ones. The interaction between all factors within the model was non-significant P0.05 for almost all cognitive processes. The development of complex multifactorial models to study cognitive processes may counteract the inherent variability in behavior genetics and the estimation and prediction of related breeding parameters key for the implementation of successful conservation programmes in apparently functionally misplaced endangered breeds.",

These spillover events underlie the importance of detecting known and novel CoVs circulating in reservoir host species and determining CoV prevalence and distribution allowing improved prediction of spillover events or where a human-reservoir interface should be closely monitored. To increase the likelihood of detecting all circulating genera and strains we have modified primers published by Watanabe et al. in 2010 to generate a semi-nested pan-CoV PCR assay. Representatives from the four coronavirus genera -CoVs -CoVs -CoVs and -CoVs were tested and all of the in-house CoVs were detected using this assay. After comparing both assays we found that the updated assay reliably detected viruses in all genera of CoVs with high sensitivity whereas the sensitivity of the original assay was lower. Our updated PCR assay is an important tool to detect monitor and track CoVs to enhance viral surveillance in reservoir hosts.",

The Adler zero for integrands is violated starting at the two-loop order and is only recovered after integration. Here we propose a soft theorem satisfied by loop integrands with any number of loops and legs. This requires a generalization of NLSM integrands to an off shell framework with certain deformed kinematics. Defining an algebraic soft limit we identify a simple nonvanishing soft behavior of integrands which we call the algebraic soft theorem. We find that the proposed soft theorem is satisfied by the surfaceintegrand of Arkani-Hamed and Figueiredo arXiv2403.04826 which is obtained from the shifted Tr3 surfacehedron integrand. Finally we derive an on shell version of the algebraic soft theorem that takes an interesting form in terms of self-energy factors and lower-loop integrands in a mixed theory of pions and scalars.",

    "abstract": "Existing models of network growth typically have one or two parameters or strategies which are fixed for all times. We introduce a general framework where feedback on the current state of a network is used to dynamically alter the values of such parameters. A specific model is analyzed where limited resources are shared among arriving nodes all vying to connect close to the root. We show that tunable feedback leads to growth of larger more efficient networks. Exact results show that linear scaling of resources with system size yields crossover to a trivial condensed state which can be considerably delayed with sublinear scaling.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE A recent Food and Drug Administration FDA warning cautioned that citalopram dosages exceeding 40 mgday may cause abnormal heart rhythms including torsade de pointes. The authors assessed relationships between citalopram use and ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. METHOD A cohort study was conducted using Veterans Health Administration data between 2004 and 2009 from depressed patients who received a prescription for citalopram N618450 or for sertraline N365898 a comparison medication with no FDA warning. Cox regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics were used to examine associations of antidepressant dosing with ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac noncardiac and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Citalopram daily doses 40 mg were associated with lower risks of ventricular arrhythmia adjusted hazard ratio0.68 95 CI0.61-0.76 all-cause mortality adjusted hazard ratio0.94 95 CI0.90-0.99 and noncardiac mortality adjusted hazard ratio0.90 95 CI0.86-0.96 compared with daily doses of 1-20 mg. No increased risks of cardiac mortality were found. Citalopram daily doses of 21-40 mg were associated with lower risks of ventricular arrhythmia adjusted hazard ratio0.80 95 CI0.74-0.86 compared with dosages of 1-20 mgday but did not have significantly different risks of any cause of mortality. The sertraline cohort revealed similar findings except there were no significant associations between daily dose and either all-cause or noncardiac mortality. CONCLUSIONS This large study found no elevated risks of ventricular arrhythmia or all-cause cardiac or noncardiac mortality associated with citalopram dosages 40 mgday. Higher dosages were associated with fewer adverse outcomes and similar findings were observed for a comparison medication sertraline not subject to the FDA warning. These results raise questions regarding the continued merit of the FDA warning.",

    "abstract": "In the vertebrate retina combinations of Notch ligands receptors and ternary complex components determine the destiny of retinal progenitor cells by regulating Hes effector gene activity. Owing to reiterated Notch signaling in numerous tissues throughout development there are multiple vertebrate paralogues for nearly every node in this pathway. These Notch signaling components can act redundantly or in a compensatory fashion during development. To dissect the complexity of this pathway during retinal development we used seven germline or conditional mutant mice and two spatiotemporally distinct Cre drivers. We perturbed the Notch ternary complex and multiple Hes genes with two overt goals in mind. First we wished to determine if Notch signaling is required in the optic stalknerve head for Hes1 sustained expression and activity. Second we aimed to test if Hes1 3 and 5 genes are functionally redundant during early retinal histogenesis. With our allelic series we found that disrupting Notch signaling consistently blocked mitotic growth and overproduced ganglion cells but we also identified two significant branchpoints for this pathway. In the optic stalknerve head sustained Hes1 is regulated independent of Notch signaling whereas during photoreceptor genesis both Notch-dependent and -independent roles for Rbpj and Hes1 impact photoreceptor genesis in opposing manners.",

Altogether the results complete a theory of functional fluctuations for complex thermodynamic nanoscale systems operating over finite periods. In addition to constructing the distribution of functional modalities one immediate consequence is a cautionary lesson ascribing a single unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system especially one on the nanoscale can be misleading likely masking an array of simultaneous parallel thermodynamic transformations that together may also be functional.

ANIMALS 239 dogs in shelters in San Diego and Imperial counties US and Mexicali and Tijuana Mexico. PROCEDURES Each dog had blood drawn and basic demographic data collected. PCR was performed to determine active infection with Rickettsia spp E canis and A platys. Serology was performed to determine exposure to Rickettsia Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species. RESULTS 2 of 78 2.6 dogs sampled in Tijuana were actively infected with R rickettsii. A single brown dog tick collected from a dog in Tijuana was PCR-positive for R rickettsii. Infection with E canis and A platys ranged across shelters from 0 to 27 and 0 to 33 respectively. Dogs in all 4 locations demonstrated exposure to all 3 pathogens though Rickettsia and Ehrlichia seropositivity was highest in Mexicali 81 and 49 respectively and Anaplasma seropositivity was highest in Tijuana 45. CLINICAL RELEVANCE While infection and exposure were highest in sheltered dogs in the southern locations dogs in all locations demonstrated exposure to all pathogens demonstrating the potential for emergence and spread of zoonotic pathogens with significant public health consequences in southern California and northern Baja California. In addition veterinarians and shelter staff should be aware that Ehrlichia or Anaplasma infection may co-occur with Rocky Mountain spotted fever which is a human health risk.",

All complexes revealed S-ligation to the metal with an expected contraction of the sulfinyl-oxygen bond length when compared to free sulfoxide. The presented data serve to illustrate three attractive yet unexplored aspects of the bissulfoxide bidentate ligand i bidentate sulfoxide ligands when chelated to a metal give rise to complexes that are pseudo-C2 symmetric in terms of both sterics and electronics ii the sulfoxides unlike typical N- P- and O-based ligands present the coordination sphere with a significant amount of steric and electronic mismatch and iii the data support the fact that sulfoxides are moderate -donors and good-to-excellent -acceptors - an aspect that should afford such metal chelates with a wide degree of reactivity. Finally X-ray crystallographic experiments coupled with an extensive CCDC search provide an opportunity to establish the following ligand-ranking scheme for bidentate ligands spanned by an ethylene bridge R2N- RSO- RS- R2P- based on the trans influence of chloride salts of PtII. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although the overall survival rates are now 80 15-20 of pediatric patients relapse with survival rates subsequently dropping to 5-10. Cmpd10357 3-amino-5-arylamino-6-chloro-N- diaminomethylene pyrazine-2-carboximide is a highly potent cell-permeant compound recently shown to have cytotoxic effects on solid tumors including human breast cancer and high-grade gliomas independent of their proliferative status. Cmpd10357 demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in two human B-ALL cell lines JM1 and Reh at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations IC50 of 3.2 and 3.3 M respectively. Cmpd10357 at a dose of 5 mgkg significantly prolonged survival in our B-ALL xenograft mouse model with a median survival time of 49.0 days compared with 45.5 days in the control group p 0.05. The cytotoxicity of Cmpd10357 demonstrated caspase-independent nonapoptotic cancer cell demise associated with the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor AIF. The cytotoxicity of Cmpd10357 in B-ALL cells was inhibited by Necrostatin-1 but not by Necrosulfonamide. These studies suggest that an AIF-mediated caspase-independent necrosis mechanism of Cmpd10357 in B-ALL could be used in combination with traditional apoptotic chemotherapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "In leukemia a distinct subpopulation of cancer-initiating cells called leukemia stem cells LSCs is believed to drive population expansion and tumor growth. Failing to eliminate LSCs may result in disease relapse regardless of the amount of non-LSCs destroyed. The first step in targeting and eliminating LSCs is to identify and characterize them. Acute precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL cells derived from patients were incubated with fluorescent glucose analog 2-N-7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1 3-diazol-4-yl Amino-2-Deoxyglucose NBDG and sorted based on NBDG uptake. Cell subpopulations defined by glucose uptake were then serially transplanted into mice and evaluated for leukemia initiating capacity. Gene expression profiles of these cells were characterized using RNA-Sequencing RNA-Seq. A distinct population of NBDG-low cells was identified in patient B-ALL samples. These cells are a small population 1.92 of the entire leukemia population have lower HLA expression and are smaller in size 4.0 to 7.0 m than the rest of the leukemia population. All mice transplanted with NBDG-low cells developed leukemia between 5 and 14 weeks while those transplanted with NBDG-high cells did not develop leukemia p 0.0001-0.002. Serial transplantation of the NBDG-low mouse model resulted in successful leukemia development. NBDG-medium NBDG-med populations also developed leukemia. Interestingly comprehensive molecular characterization of NBDG-low and NBDG-med cells from patient-derived xenograft PDX models using RNA-Seq revealed a distinct profile of 2162 differentially-expressed transcripts DETs p0.05 with 70.6 down-regulated in NBDG-low cells. Hierarchical clustering of DETs showed distinct segregation of NBDG-low from NBDG-med and NBDG-high groups with marked transcription expression alterations in the NBDG-low group consistent with cancer survival. In conclusion A unique subpopulation of cells with low glucose uptake NBDG-low in B-ALL was discovered. These cells despite their quiescence characteristics once transplanted in mice showed potent leukemia initiating capacity. Although NBDG-med cells also initiated leukemia gene expression profiling revealed a distinct signature that clearly distinguishes NBDG-low cells from NBDG-med and the rest of the leukemia populations. These results suggest that NBDG-low cells may represent quiescent LSCs. These cells can be activated in the appropriate environment in vivo showing leukemia initiating capacity. Our study provides insight into the biologic mechanisms of B-ALL initiation and survival.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS Although results of surgical ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus PDA in the pediatric age group are excellent surgical management of the adult with a PDA may be more problematic. The PDA that presents in adulthood may be calcified and friable rendering simple ligation via a thoracotomy difficult inadequate and hazardous. Patch closure of the ductus arteriosus from either the aortic or pulmonary artery orifice using cardiopulmonary bypass or transient aortic cross-clamping is necessary but increases surgical risk. Furthermore older patients with diseases unrelated to their PDA and patients with Downs syndrome may have higher risks with intubation general anesthesia and surgery. Early results of percutaneous transcatheter occlusion of the PDA with Gianturco coils performed under sedation and local anesthesia are promising. METHODS Six adults with mean age of 39.1 years range 23.1-62.0 years were found to have an isolated PDA with mean minimum diameter of 2.7 mm range 1.0-5.0 mm at cardiac catheterization. All underwent percutaneous transcatheter occlusion of the PDA using Gianturco coils. RESULTS Coil implantation was successful in all patients. There were no complications and all were discharged home within 24 hours. Complete ductal occlusion was seen immediately in 4 of 6 patients 67 while 2 of 6 33 had small residual leaks. However complete occlusion was achieved in all patients by 6 months following the procedure. CONCLUSION Transcatheter occlusion of the PDA using coils is safe and efficacious in adults.",

    "abstract": "The sagittal bands are a component of the extensor hood. They serve an important role in stabilizing the extensor tendon by forming a check-rein to radial-ulnar translation of the tendon over the metacarpal head and extending the metacarpophalangeal MCP joint by virtue of attaching the extensor tendon to the palmar plate. Injury to the sagittal band is thought to cause extensor instability and subluxation to the contralateral side by disruption of this check-rein function although recent evidence from cadaver studies suggests that ulnar sagittal band tear may be spared of extensor instability. As a case in point we encountered a patient with surgically proven ulnar sagittal band tear who did not have any extensor tendon subluxation or any limitation in motion. Intraoperative findings demonstrated a chronic-appearing ulnar sagittal band tear indicating that chronic injury with fibrosis may stabilize the central band. Therefore in patients with metacarpophalangeal pain without central tendon subluxation or limitation of motion it remains important to raise the concern of sagittal band tear for appropriate treatment. We present the clinical course of this case with radiological and operative findings followed by a review of the relevant literature.",

We present a KeckEchelle Spectrograph and Imager longslit spectroscopy for 27 isolated galaxies in this regime 20 quiescent galaxies and 7 star-forming galaxies. We measure emission line strengths as a function of radius and place galaxies on the Baldwin Phillips Terlevich BPT diagram. Remarkably 16 of 20 quiescent galaxies in our sample host central active galactic nucleus AGN- like line ratios. Only five of these quiescent galaxies were identified as AGN-like in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey due to a lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that many of the quiescent galaxies in our sample have spatially extended emission across the non-star-forming regions of BPT-space.

    "abstract": "Achromatopsia is a congenital autosomal recessively inherited disorder characterized by a lack of color discrimination low visual acuity 0.2 photophobia and nystagmus. Mutations in the genes for CNGA3 CNGB3 and GNAT2 have been associated with this disorder. Here we analyzed the spectrum and prevalence of CNGB3 gene mutations in a cohort of 341 independent patients with achromatopsia. In 163 patients CNGB3 mutations could be identified. A total of 105 achromats carried apparent homozygous mutations 44 were compound double heterozygotes and 14 patients had only a single mutant allele. The derived CNGB3 mutation spectrum comprises 28 different mutations including 12 nonsense mutations eight insertions andor deletions five putative splice site mutations and three missense mutations. Thus the majority of mutations in the CNGB3 gene result in significantly altered andor truncated polypeptides. Several mutations were found recurrently in particular a 1 bp deletion c.1148delC which accounts for over 70 of all CNGB3 mutant alleles. In conclusion mutations in the CNGB3 gene are responsible for approximately 50 of all patients with achromatopsia. This indicates that the CNGB3ACHM3 locus on chromosome 8q21 is the major locus for achromatopsia in patients of European origin or descent.",

We found significant differences in degree of overall liking among children from the three countries p 0.001. Specifically children in China gave higher overall liking scores than children in the US and in the US higher than in Chile. Child age and gender did not influence childrens vegetable overall liking across the three countries. Across all countries and age groups liking of taste and texture were the best predictors of children overall liking. The penalty analysis of CATA selections by children showed that the mean impact of the attributes that children used to describe the samples on their liking varied among countries with the descriptors having the least impact on liking for Chinese children.",

Leukaemic cells with the TEL-AML1 transcript appear to be very sensitive to chemotherapy and may be eradicated in most patients if adequate chemotherapy is given. However a small number of patients with t1221 ALL may relapse under the currently used chemotherapy and we believe that RT-PCR for detecting MRD with the transcript is a suitable tool for monitoring the efficacy of chemotherapy or impending relapse in these patients. We analysed the TEL-AML1 transcript using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR in order to detect minimal residual disease MRD in seven children with t1221-associated B-lineage ALL. Two sets of primers TEL exon 5 and AML1 exon 3 or 4 detected two types of transcript in four patients and two other types in two other patients. The two different translocation breakpoints in the AML1 gene with or without splicing out of AML1 exon 3 seemed to result in these four types of transcript in leukaemia samples.",

The conventional CDN structure for video delivery is based on the IP-over-WDM network which could not meet the requirements for HD-VoD service such as high-speed transfer and low latency and jitter. A novel all-optical CDN network model for high-definition VoD service is proposed in this paper. We introduce the concept of optical timeslot in the lightpath provision. A mini-control plane mechanism based on ring topology is also designed for the fast optical timeslot setuprelease. Simulation results and analysis of our model is showed at the end of paper. 2011 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.",

This work found that 35.7 of burn patients over 65 years old were frail at the time of their burn admission while 19.2 of burn patients 50 to 64 years old were frail. While frailty is associated with increased age the two are separate entities suggesting that frailty may be present in much younger patients who present with burn injuries. We hypothesize that frailty exists in all age groups of patients presenting with burn injury and the prevalence increases with age.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleMethodsjatstitle jatspFollowing IRB approval a 5-year 20142019 retrospective chart review was conducted of all burn patients admitted to the burn center. Data collected includes age gender and burn size TBSA. Frailty was determined using the Modified Frailty Index 11 MFI 11 from co-morbidities included in the burn registry. Patients were considered frail if they have an MFI 2 and pre-frail for an MFI1 and amplt 2. Patients were assessed by decades for age.

This increases with each age group to the 71-80-year-old group in which 41.7 of patients are pre-frail. The over 80-year-old group had slightly fewer pre-frail patients 35.9. There were no frail patients in the under 20-year-old group. In the 2130 there were 3 patients 0.7 that had an MFI of 2 or more placing them in the frail group.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study with dogs at least 1-year post treatment. Computed tomography was performed and quantitative measurements from previous fracture sites were compared with measurements from contralateral limbs. Subjective evaluation included gait assessment and palpation. RESULTS Six patients met the inclusion criteria. The rhBMP-2 treated bone exhibited higher density at the periphery and lower density in the centre similar to the contralateral limb. All patients were weight bearing on the treated limb and all fractures were healed. CONCLUSION The rhBMP-2-treated bone underwent restoration of normal architecture and density. Acceptable limb function was present in all patients. The results of this study can serve as a basis for long-term response in treating nonunion fractures in veterinary patients.",

However the association of early mortality 60 days with location of initial care sociodemographic factors and complications has not been evaluated in pediatric and young adult YA patients with ALL. METHODS Using the California Cancer Registry linked to hospitalization data we identified pediatric and YA patients with ALL who received inpatient leukemia treatment between 1991 and 2014. Patients were classified as receiving all or partnone of their care at an SCC Childrens Oncology Group- or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. Propensity scores were created for treatment at an SCC in each age group. Multivariable inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models identified factors associated with early mortality. Results are presented as hazard ratios HRs and 95 CIs. RESULTS Among 6531 newly diagnosed pediatric 18 years and YA 19 to 39 years of age patients with ALL 1.6 of children and 5.4 of YAs died within 60 days of diagnosis. Most children received all of their care at an SCC n 4752 85.7 compared with 35.5 of YAs n 1779. Early mortality rates were lower in pediatric patients and those receiving all care at an SCC pediatric all 1.5 v partnone 2.4 P .049 YAs all 3.2 v partnone 6.6 P .001. However in adjusted models receiving all care at an SCC was associated with significantly lower early mortality in YAs HR 0.51 95 CI 0.32 to 0.81 but not in pediatric patients HR 0.77 95 CI 0.47 to 1.25. CONCLUSION YAs with ALL experience significant reductions in early mortality after treatment at SCCs.",

    "abstract": "Rodents are a major order of mammals that is highly diverse in distribution and lifestyle. Five suborders 34 families and 2277 species within this order occupy a number of different niches and vary along several lifestyle dimensions such as diel pattern diurnal vs. nocturnal terrain niche and diet. For example the terrain niche of rodents includes arboreal aerial terrestrial semi-aquatic burrowing and rock dwelling. Not surprisingly the behaviors associated with particular lifestyles are also highly variable and thus the neocortex which generates these behaviors has undergone corresponding alterations across species. Studies of cortical organization in species that vary along several dimensions such as terrain niche diel pattern and rearing conditions demonstrate that the size and number of cortical fields can be highly variable within this order. The internal organization of a cortical field also reflects lifestyle differences between species and exaggerates behaviorally relevant effectors such as vibrissae teeth or lips. Finally at a cellular level neuronal number and density varies for the same cortical field in different species and is even different for the same species reared in different conditions laboratory vs. wild-caught. These very large differences across and within rodent species indicate that there is no generic rodent model. Rather there are rodent models suited for specific questions regarding the development function and evolution of the neocortex.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma can be challenging and resource intensive. Observation with serial clinical assessments plays a major role in the evaluation of these patients but the time required for intra-abdominal injury to become clinically apparent is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of time required for an intra-abdominal injury to become clinically apparent after blunt abdominal trauma via physical examination or commonly followed clinical values. METHODS A retrospective review of patients who sustained blunt trauma resulting in intra-abdominal injury between June 2010 and June 2012 at a Level 1 academic trauma center was performed. Patient demographics injuries and the amount of time from emergency department admission to sign or symptom development and subsequent diagnosis were recorded. All diagnoses were made by computed tomography or at the time of surgery. Patient transfers from other hospitals were excluded. RESULTS Of 3574 blunt trauma patients admitted to the hospital 285 8 experienced intra-abdominal injuries. The mean SD age was 36 17 years the majority were male 194 patients 68 and the mean SD Injury Severity Score ISS was 21 14. The mean SD time from admission to diagnosis via computed tomography or surgery was 74 55 minutes. Eighty patients 28 required either surgery 78 patients 17 or radiographic embolization 2 patients 0.7 for their injury. All patients who required intervention demonstrated a sign or symptom of their intra-abdominal injury within 60 minutes of arrival although two patients were intervened upon in a delayed fashion. All patients with a blunt intra-abdominal injury manifested a clinical sign or symptom of their intra-abdominal injury resulting in their diagnosis within 8 hours 25 minutes of arrival to the hospital. CONCLUSION All diagnosed intra-abdominal injuries from blunt trauma manifested clinical signs or symptoms that could prompt imaging or intervention leading to their diagnosis within 8 hours 25 minutes of arrival to the hospital. All patients who required an intervention for their injury manifested a sign or symptom of their injury within 60 minutes of arrival. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic study level IV.

ANIMALS 6 healthy adult cats. PROCEDURES Each cat was anesthetized with isoflurane 1.5 X minimum alveolar concentration on 4 occasions. Cardiopulmonary measurements were obtained after a 30-minute stabilization period 20 minutes after the start of each infusion dose and 30 60 and 90 minutes after the infusion was discontinued. Cats received 5 progressively increasing infusions of epinephrine or phenylephrine 0.125 0.25 0.5 1 and 2 microgkgmin or dobutamine or dopamine 2.5 5 10 15 and 20 microgkgmin. The order of treatment was randomly allocated. Results-All 4 treatments increased oxygen delivery. Heart rate HR increased during administration of all drugs except phenylephrine and mean arterial pressure increased during administration of all drugs except dobutamine. A progressive metabolic acidosis was detected but whole-blood lactate concentration only increased during administration of epinephrine and dobutamine. Systemic vascular resistance index increased during administration of phenylephrine decreased during administration of dobutamine and remained unchanged during administration of dopamine and epinephrine. A positive inotropic effect was detected with all treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE During anesthesia in cats administration of dopamine dobutamine and epinephrine may be useful for increasing cardiac output with dopamine having the most useful effects. Administration of phenylephrine increased cardiac and systemic vascular resistance indexes with minimal effect on HR and may be useful for increasing mean arterial pressure without increasing HR.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is an independent and modifiable risk factor for aging and age-related disorders. Routine lipid panel cannot capture all individual lipid species in blood i.e. blood lipidome. To date a comprehensive assessment of the blood lipidome associated with mortality is lacking in large-scale community-dwelling individuals especially in a longitudinal setting. Using liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry we repeatedly measured individual lipid species in 3821 plasma samples collected at two visits 5.5 years apart from 1930 unique American Indians in the Strong Heart Family Study. We first identified baseline lipids associated with risks for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality mean follow-up period 17.8 years in American Indians followed by replication of top hits in European Caucasians in the Malm Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort n 3943 mean follow-up period 23.7 years. The model adjusted age sex BMI smoking hypertension diabetes and LDL-c at baseline. We then examined the associations between changes in lipid species and risk of mortality. Multiple testing was controlled by false discovery rate FDR. We found that baseline levels and longitudinal changes of multiple lipid species e.g. cholesterol esters glycerophospholipids sphingomyelins and triacylglycerols were significantly associated with risks of all-cause or CVD mortality. Many lipids identified in American Indians could be replicated in European Caucasians. Network analysis identified differential lipid networks associated with risk of mortality. Our findings provide novel insight into the role of dyslipidemia in disease mortality and offer potential biomarkers for early prediction and risk reduction in American Indians and other ethnic groups.",

Principal outcomes were deep vein thrombosis in both the lower and upper extremities pulmonary embolism and mortality. Among 5394 cases with acute myelogenous leukemia AML the 2-year cumulative incidence of VTE was 281 5.2. Sixty-four percent of the VTE events occurred within 3 months of AML diagnosis. In AML patients female sex older age number of chronic comorbidities and presence of a catheter were significant predictors of development of VTE within 1 year. A diagnosis of VTE was not associated with reduced survival in AML patients. Among 2482 cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL the 2-year incidence of VTE in ALL was 4.5. Risk factors for VTE were presence of a central venous catheter older age and number of chronic comorbidities. In the patients with ALL development of VTE was associated with a 40 increase in the risk of dying within 1 year. The incidence of VTE in acute leukemia is appreciable and is comparable with the incidence in many solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The infraorder Mygalomorphae i.e. trapdoor spiders tarantulas funnel web spiders etc. is one of three main lineages of spiders. Comprising 15 families 325 genera and over 2600 species the group is a diverse assemblage that has retained a number of features considered primitive for spiders. Despite an evolutionary history dating back to the lower Triassic the group has received comparatively little attention with respect to its phylogeny and higher classification. The few phylogenies published all share the common thread that a stable classification scheme for the group remains unresolved. METHODS AND FINDINGS We report here a reevaluation of mygalomorph phylogeny using the rRNA genes 18S and 28S the nuclear protein-coding gene EF-1 and a morphological character matrix. Taxon sampling includes members of all 15 families representing 58 genera. The following results are supported in our phylogenetic analyses of the data 1 the Atypoidea i.e. antrodiaetids atypids and mecicobothriids is a monophyletic group sister to all other mygalomorphs and 2 the families Mecicobothriidae Hexathelidae Cyrtaucheniidae Nemesiidae Ctenizidae and Dipluridae are not monophyletic. The Microstigmatidae is likely to be subsumed into Nemesiidae. Nearly half of all mygalomorph families require reevaluation of generic composition and placement. The polyphyletic family Cyrtaucheniidae is most problematic representing no fewer than four unrelated lineages. CONCLUSIONS Based on these analyses we propose the following nomenclatural changes 1 the establishment of the family Euctenizidae NEW RANK 2 establishment of the subfamily Apomastinae within the Euctenizidae and 3 the transfer of the cyrtaucheniid genus Kiama to Nemesiidae. Additional changes include relimitation of Domiothelina and Theraphosoidea and the establishment of the Euctenizoidina clade Idiopidae Euctenizidae. In addition to these changes we propose a road map for future sampling across the infraorder with the aim of solving many remaining questions that hinder mygalomorph systematics.",

    "abstract": "We propose the first unified objective framework SyCLoPS for detecting and classifying all types of low-pressure systems LPSs in a given data set. We use the state-of-the-art automated feature tracking software TempestExtremes TE to detect and track LPS features globally in ERA5 and compute 16 parameters from commonly found atmospheric variables for classification. A Python classifier is implemented to classify all LPSs at once. The framework assigns 16 different labels classes to each LPS data point and designates four different types of high-impact LPS tracks including tracks of tropical cyclone TC monsoonal system subtropical storm and polar low. The classification process involves disentangling high-altitude and drier LPSs differentiating tropical and non-tropical LPSs using novel criteria and optimizing for the detection of the four types of high-impact LPS. A comparison of our labels with those in the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship IBTrACS revealed an overall accuracy of 95 in distinguishing between tropical systems extratropical cyclones and disturbances. SyCLoPS produces a better TC detection skill compared to the previous algorithms highlighted by an approximately 6 reduction in the false alarm rate compared to the previous TE algorithm. The vertical cross section composite of the four types of high-impact LPS we detect each shows distinct structural characteristics. Finally we demonstrate that SyCLoPS is valuable for investigating various aspects of LPSs in climate data such as the evolution of a single LPS track patterns of LPS frequencies and precipitation or wind influence associated with a particular LPS class.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE We seek to identify the current role and practices of the surgery morbidity and mortality MM conference in academic surgery departments in the United States and Canada. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS All members of the Society of Surgical Chairs a program of the American College of Surgeons were e-mailed an IRB-approved 28-question electronic survey in fall 2017. Up to 3 reminders were sent. RESULTS Responses from 129186 69 departments of surgery were received. Nearly all departments 96 continue to have a departmental MM conference. The MM conference is typically weekly 93 between 7 and 9 AM 80 on weekdays during which there are no scheduled elective operations 84. Attendance is mandatory for residents 98 but required for faculty in only 49 of departments. Fewer than half of all departments 44 have written guidelines as to which complications should be reported to MM. Most conferences are prepared case presentations 89 but may include unprepared discussions 17 case-based educational presentations 30 or a combination 28. The most common classification category was by root case of the error 60 and preventability 58. Most departments keep electronic andor physical MM reports while 21 maintain a relational database and 25 do not retain records. While almost all 96 departments reported participating in at least one national quality improvement program these are not often linked to the MM process. CONCLUSIONS MM is predominantly seen as an educational conference based on a few select cases. Departmental quality is monitored with hospital-driven or national quality improvement efforts. Integration of hospital-based quality metric programs with surgery MM conference is uncommon and represents an opportunity for hospital-department collaboration.",

Mechanisms leading to these positive relationships include mate limitation saturating predation risk and cooperative breeding and foraging. Individuals within these populations may differ in age size or geographic location and thereby structure these populations. Here I study structured population models accounting for positive density-dependence and environmental stochasticity i.e. random fluctuations in the demographic rates of the population. Under an accessibility assumption roughly stochastic fluctuations can lead to populations getting small and large these models are shown to exhibit a dynamical trichotomy i for all initial conditions the population goes asymptotically extinct with probability one ii for all positive initial conditions the population persists and asymptotically exhibits unbounded growth and iii for all positive initial conditions there is a positive probability of asymptotic extinction and a complementary positive probability of unbounded growth. The main results are illustrated with applications to spatially structured populations with an Allee effect and age-structured populations experiencing mate limitation.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how honey bee population dynamics the scale and timing of almond bloom and unmarketability of almond honey interact to create misaligned incentives for growers and beekeepers in the California almond pollination services market. We combine economic contract theory with data from the first pollination contract survey to examine the design of pollination contracts. 89.2 of respondents used contracts with minimum colony population requirements suggesting that all colonies are not considered to be equal providers of pollination services. Contracts that involved enforcement every year provided the highest pollination fees on average while those with no enforcement provided the lowest fees. We contribute to the literature regarding pollination services by demonstrating that the number of hives and price per hive present an incomplete picture of almond pollination transactions without information regarding colony strength requirements and enforcement. We also provide a theoretical rationale for why almond pollination agreements have anecdotally become more formal over time as the marginal value of colony strength increases the grower offers the beekeeper stronger incentives to provide high colony strength. California almond production is an extreme case of a crop relying almost solely on managed pollinators but ultimately could reflect the future for many pollinator-dependent crops if pollinator populations continue to decrease while monoculture crop production increases.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Undernutrition is associated with an elevated risk of mortality among children in low- and middle-income countries. Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements LNS have been evaluated as a method to prevent undernutrition and improve infant development but the effects on mortality are unknown. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to evaluate the effect of LNS on all-cause mortality among children 6-24 mo old. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of LNS designed to prevent undernutrition with or without other interventions. Literature was searched in May 2019 and trials were included if they enrolled children between 6 and 24 mo old and the period of supplementation lasted 6 mo. We extracted data from participant flow diagrams and contacted study investigators to request data. We conducted a meta-analysis to produce summary RR estimates. RESULTS We identified 18 trials conducted in 11 countries that enrolled 41280 children and reported 586 deaths. The risk of mortality was lower in the LNS arms than in the non-LNS comparison arms RR 0.73 95 CI 0.59 0.89 13 trials. Estimates were similar when trials with maternal LNS intervention arms were added or when alternative formulations of LNS were excluded. The results appeared stronger in trials in which LNS were compared with passive control arms. Excluding these contrasts and only comparing multicomponent arms with LNS groups and comparison groups that contained all the same components without LNS attenuated the effect estimate RR 0.82 95 CI 0.61 1.10. CONCLUSIONS LNS provided for the prevention of undernutrition may reduce the risk of mortality but more trials with appropriate comparison groups allowing isolation of the effect of LNS alone are needed.This study was registered at www.crd.york.ac.ukPROSPERO as CRD42019128718.",

    "abstract": "For monitoring of concussion brain function organ condition and other medical applications what is needed is a non-invasive method of monitoring tissue metabolism. MRI-based functional imaging technology detects changes in blood oxygenation a correlate of neural activity and thus may offer a prediction of prognosis in cases of concussion and other cerebral traumas. Yet potential relationships between perturbations to cerebral metabolism and patient outcomes cannot be effectively exploited clinically because we lack a practical low-cost non-invasive means to monitor cerebral oxygenation and metabolism in the emergency department operating room or medical facilities. We have developed a device to optically assay the redox state of Cytochrome-C-Oxidase CCO the mitochondrial enzyme responsible for the last step of the electron transport chain. Changes in CCO redox reflect changes in respiratory flux and thus changes in the rate of oxidative adenosine triphosphate ATP synthesis. In other words changes in CCO reflect brain cells metabolic activity more directly than the traditional blood oxygenation measurement methods. To non-invasively measure changes in CCO as well as blood oxygenation we have developed a Super-Continuum Infrared Spectroscopy of Cytochrome-C-Oxidase SCISCCO system that uses an all-fiber integrated super-continuum light source to simultaneously measure both of the new CCO and the traditional blood oxygenation markers of neural metabolism. The SCISCCO system is validated by confirming the near-infrared spectrum of CCO in vitro. To demonstrate in vivo feasibility the measured responses of oxygenation and CCO responses to acute ischemia e.g. blood pressure tests in human participants are compared to data from the literature. Furthermore we show that the new devices measurements of oxygenated HbO and deoxygenated HbR hemoglobin in response to breath hold challenges are principled and consistent with previously reported findings. The validated SCISCCO system is finally applied to measure cerebral oxygenation and the redox state of CCO in participants during an attention test protocol. Twenty-five healthy adults completed an attention task that included nine 60-second periods of attention task interleaved with 60-s periods of resting baseline. It has been well established that the frontal lobe of the human brain is active during tasks of attention. We therefore predicted that attention task should elicit an increase in HbO concentration accompanied by a decrease in redox state of CCO e.g. ratio of oxidized CCO to reduced CCO in frontal lobe brain regions as measured with the SCISCCO system. Our findings are consistent with our predictions HbO concentration increases while CCO concentration decreases during the attention blocks relative to the resting baseline thereby indicating an increase in oxidative metabolism of the frontal lobe brain regions of interest. Our systematic multi-method approach thus validates the new device as well as the validity of the metabolic biomarkers that it measures. The SCISCCO system could be a new tool for monitoring brain and organ metabolism which could be invaluable for screening concussion patients or use in an operating or emergency room to gauge patients organ response to treatments.",

Current industry methods lack the predictive capacity to accurately estimate how well a wort will ferment in the brewhouse. Wort from two mashing styles high-temperature infusion and low-temperature ramping and under varying grist to liquor GL ratios were produced and the differences in maltose maltotriose and glucose were measured. The two mashing styles showed differences in original extract Plato values between the GL ratios with a 12 GL having the highest original extract. Maltose was the most abundant sugar in all sample types. All worts were scanned using Fourier transform infrared FTIR and the spectra also showed differences between the original extract and final extract with most of the changes around the spectral region associated with carbohydrates a result of sugar utilization by the yeast. FTIR calibrations for extract and fermentable sugars all had r2 values 0.98 with ratio of standard error of prediction to standard deviation 5. The results indicated changing fermentable sugar levels thus making a prediction of fermentability possible. The FTIR also provided a rapid measure of changes in the fermentable sugar profile which could assist maltsters and brewers in monitoring malt and beer quality.

RT-PCR used to determine the relative abundance of the AtNHX transcripts showed that while AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 transcripts were abundant and widely distributed in all tissues AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 transcripts were almost exclusively detected in flower and root tissues respectively. AtNHX5 transcripts were observed at very low levels in all tissues. The potential for the use of these genes for the engineering of salt tolerance in crop plants is discussed.",

Hepatic epoxide hydrolase was purified from human samples and clofibrate-fed mice by affinity chromatography. The major metabolites under these conditions of all the epoxy fatty esters were their vicinal diols whose structures were confirmed by GC-MS. 1213-Epoxymethyloleate was metabolized faster than 910-epoxymethyloleate and other epoxy fatty esters but all substrates were turned over rapidly.

    "abstract": "From a genomic analysis of rumen butyrivibrios Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio sp. we have re-evaluated the contribution of electron transport phosphorylation ETP to ATP formation in this group. This group is unique in that most 76 genomes were predicted to possess genes for both Ech and Rnf transmembrane ion pumps. These pumps act in concert with the NifJ and Bcd-Etf to form a electrochemical potential H and Na which drives ATP synthesis by ETP. Of the 62 total butyrivibrio genomes currently available from the Hungate 1000 project all 62 were predicted to possess NifJ which reduces oxidized ferredoxin Fdox during pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA. All 62 possessed all subunits of Bcd-Etf which reduces Fdox and oxidizes reduced NAD during crotonyl-CoA reduction. Additionally 61 genomes possessed all subunits of the Rnf which generates H or Na from oxidation of reduced Fd Fdred and reduction of oxidized NAD. Further 47 genomes possessed all six subunits of the Ech which generates H from oxidation of Fdred. For glucose fermentation to butyrate and H2 the electrochemical potential established should drive synthesis of 1.5 ATP by the F0F1-ATP synthase possessed by all 62 genomes. The total yield is 4.5 ATPglucose after accounting for three ATP formed by classic substrate-level phosphorylation and it is one the highest yields for any glucose fermentation. The yield was the same when unsaturated fatty acid bonds not H served as the electron acceptor as during biohydrogenation. Possession of both Ech and Rnf had been previously documented in only a few sulfate-reducers was rare in other rumen prokaryotic genomes in our analysis and may confer an energetic advantage to rumen butyrivibrios. This unique energy conservation system might enhance the butyrivibrios ability to overcome growth inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids as postulated herein.",

Standing crop and coverage of the plant community are reduced wholesale when one or a few species of potent herbivores are not suppressed. Primary carnivores or diseases by suppressing herbivores switch the substrate from open to well-occupied by plants. In true trophic cascades pervasive top-down influence combines with the always strong bottom-up influence through the food chain to produce acute intertwining between population community and ecosystem processes. True trophic cascades imply keystone species taxa with such top-down dominance that their removal causes precipitous changes in the system. The authors premise is that true cascades in the community sense are a relatively unusual sort of food web mechanics. Over the full range of ecological communites evidence is that these cascades are restricted to fairly low-diversity places where great influence can issue from one or a few species. Most examples of true trophic cascades have algae at the base and are aquatic. The author demonstrates the vulnerability of the turf of some algal ecosystems emphasises that not all algal ecosystems cascade examines reticulate webs in high-diversity systems and considers the architecture depicted in true trophic cascades reminiscent of a ladder with trophic webs. -from Author",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE On the basis of the results of the ZUMA-3 trial brexucabtagene autoleucel brexu-cel a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy gained US Food and Drug Administration approval in October 2021 for adults with relapsedrefractory RR B-cell ALL B-ALL. We report outcomes of patients treated with brexu-cel as a standard therapy. METHODS We developed a collaboration across 31 US centers to study adults with B-ALL who received brexu-cel outside the context of a clinical trial. Data were collected retrospectively from October 2021 to October 2023. Toxicities were graded per American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy guidelines for cytokine release syndrome CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome ICANS. RESULTS At the time of data lock 204 patients had undergone apheresis and 189 were infused. Median follow-up time was 11.4 months. Forty-two percent of patients received brexu-cel in morphologic remission and would have been ineligible for participation in ZUMA-3. After brexu-cel 151 achieved complete remission CR of which 79 were measurable residual disease MRD negative remissions. Median progression-free survival PFS was 9.5 months and median overall survival was not reached. Grade 3-4 CRS or ICANS occurred in 11 and 31 respectively. In multivariable analysis patients receiving consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT hazard ratio 0.34 95 CI 0.14 to 0.85 after brexu-cel had superior PFS compared with those who did not receive any consolidation or maintenance therapy. CONCLUSION Similar to ZUMA-3 high rates of MRD-negative CR were observed after brexu-cel treatment for RR B-ALL. The use of HCT as consolidation after brexu-cel resulted in improved PFS.",

DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional study. SAMPLE Dry n 20 and canned 20 nontherapeutic canine diets. PROCEDURES Reported maximum CF concentrations were obtained from product labels. Concentrations of CF and TDF were measured in samples of the diets for comparison. For each diet percentages of TDF represented by insoluble dietary fiber IDF and soluble dietary fiber SDF were determined. RESULTS For dry or canned diets the median reported maximum CF concentration was significantly greater than the median measured value. Measured CF concentration was significantly lower than measured TDF concentration for all diets. Median percentage of TDF dry-matter basis in dry and canned diets was 10.3 and 6.5 respectively overall range 3.9 to 25.8. Fiber composition in dry and canned diets differed median percentage of TDF provided by IDF dry-matter basis was 83.4 in dry diets and 63.6 in canned diets. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Among the evaluated diets measured CF concentration underrepresented measured TDF concentration. Diets provided a wide range of TDF concentration and proportions of IDF and SDF were variable. In the absence of information regarding TDF concentration neither reported maximum nor measured CF concentration appears to be a particularly reliable indicator of fiber concentration and composition of a given canine diet.",

    "abstract": "Leakage currents in on-chip SRAMs caches branch predictor register files and TLBs are major contributors to the energy dissipated by processors in deep sub-micron technologies. High leakage also increases chip temperature and some SRAM-based structures become thermal hotspots. Previous work has addressed major sources of SRAM leakage in memory cells and bit-lines making remaining SRAM components in particular large drivers the primary source of leakage. This paper proposes an approach to reduce this source of leakage in all major SRAM-based units of the processor controlling them in a uniform way yet treating each unit individually based on its behavior and memory organization. The new approach uses multiple bias voltages in sleep transistors allowing a trade-off between leakage reduction and wakeup delay in multi-stage peripheral drivers. Four low-power modes are defined from basic to ultra low power and SRAMs dynamically transition between these modes to minimize leakage without sacrificing performance. A novel control mechanism monitors and predicts future processor behavior for mode control. The leakage reduction in individual units is evaluated and shown to vary from 25 for IL1 to 75 for L2 caches. Resulting temperature reduction including the effect of positive feedback between temperature and leakage power is evaluated. A significant temperature reduction is achieved in each unit. It is also shown to reduce hot spots in the instruction TLB and branch predictor. 2010 ACM.",

    "abstract": "In the Western United States volcanic spring-fed rivers are anticipated to become increas-ingly more important for salmonids and other native fishes as these rivers will retain coldwater habitats as the climate warms. Despite this little is known about the hydro-biogeochemical interactions within these ecosystems. A review of existing literature on spring-fed rivers coupled with a decade of research on volcanic spring-fed rivers of northern California finds that these systems are exceptionally productive and exhibit stable environmental conditions. These unique conditions stem from hydrogeologic processes typical of young volcanic terrains. Aquatic macrophytes com-mon to some nutrient-rich spring-fed systems play a disproportionate role in hydrologic and geo-morphic processes by facilitating ecological interactions and velocity conditions that improve juvenile salmonid growth. We find that volcanic spring-fed rivers are also resilient to climate change due not only to their ability to dampen water temperature changes through deep groundwater flow but also because of their nutrient-driven high ecosystem productivity which may enable coldwater species to metabolically compensate for marginal increases in water temperature. Understanding the fundamental geomorphic and ecological differences between these rare ecosystems and their numerically dominant runoff rivers is essential for developing long-term conservation strategies for coldwater species under a rapidly changing climate.",

    "abstract": "The study of the mammalian microbiome serves as a critical tool for understanding host-microbial diversity and coevolution and the impact of bacterial communities on host health. While studies of specific microbial systems e.g. in the human gut have rapidly increased large knowledge gaps remain hindering our understanding of the determinants and levels of variation in microbiomes across multiple body sites and host species. Here we compare microbiome community compositions from eight distinct body sites among 17 phylogenetically diverse species of nonhuman primates NHPs representing the largest comparative study of microbial diversity across primate host species and body sites. Analysis of 898 samples predominantly acquired in the wild demonstrated that oral microbiomes were unique in their clustering with distinctive divergence from all other body site microbiomes. In contrast all other body site microbiomes clustered principally by host species and differentiated by body site within host species. These results highlight two key findings i the oral microbiome is unique compared to all other body site microbiomes and conserved among diverse nonhuman primates despite their considerable dietary and phylogenetic differences and ii assessments of the determinants of host-microbial diversity are relative to the level of the comparison i.e. intra-inter-body site -host species and -individual emphasizing the need for broader comparative microbial analyses across diverse hosts to further elucidate host-microbial dynamics evolutionary and biological patterns of variation and implications for human-microbial coevolution. IMPORTANCE The microbiome is critical to host health and disease but much remains unknown about the determinants levels and evolution of host-microbial diversity. The relationship between hosts and their associated microbes is complex. Most studies to date have focused on the gut microbiome however large gaps remain in our understanding of host-microbial diversity coevolution and levels of variation in microbiomes across multiple body sites and host species. To better understand the patterns of variation and evolutionary context of host-microbial communities we conducted one of the largest comparative studies to date which indicated that the oral microbiome was distinct from the microbiomes of all other body sites and convergent across host species suggesting conserved niche specialization within the Primates order. We also show the importance of host species differences in shaping the microbiome within specific body sites. This large comparative study contributes valuable information on key patterns of variation among hosts and body sites with implications for understanding host-microbial dynamics and human-microbial coevolution.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD patients with exacerbations despite optimized bronchodilator therapy roflumilast and chronic azithromycin are recommended options. Roflumilast is recommended in severe COPD patients with chronic bronchitis whereas chronic azithromycin is more broadly indicated. The comparative effectiveness between these 2 treatments to reduce exacerbation rate remains unclear. OBJECTIVES Our objective was analysis of the Veterans Health Administration VHA database medication and claims data without lung function or presence of chronic bronchitis or tobacco use to compare the effectiveness of roflumilast and azithromycin on hospitalizations and mortality. METHODS The primary outcome of the study was cumulative incidences of first COPD-related and all-cause hospitalization. Sensitivity analysis on hospitalizations was conducted for VHA patients who also had Medicare. RESULTS In 1302 roflumilast and 2573 azithromycin patients the all-cause mortality rates at 1 year were 19 and 15 respectively. The median times-to-all-cause death were 47 months interquartile range IQR 16-81 for the roflumilast and 48 months IQR 20-83 for the azithromycin groups. Roflumilast was associated with higher mortality hazard ratio HR 1.16 95 confidence interval CI 1.04-1.29. Roflumilast showed no significant association for COPD-related hospitalization subdistribution HR SHR1.14 95 CI 1.00-1.29 and all-cause hospitalization HR 1.07 95 CI 0.97-1.18. For patients with Medicare N2030 roflumilast was associated with higher COPD-related SHR 1.21 95 CI 1.05-1.41 and all-cause SHR 1.23 95 CI 1.09-1.38 hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS Roflumilast was associated with higher hazard ratios for death COPD-related hospitalizations and all-cause hospitalizations in COPD patients only after adjustment for VHA and external Medicare events. Prospective clinical trials are needed to directly compare the relative efficacy of these therapies.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Flank pain associated with stone disease is typically caused by a stone that obstructs urine flow. However it is plausible that nonobstructing kidney stones may still cause pain. We performed a multicenter observational trial to evaluate whether treatment of small nonobstructing calyceal stones improves pain and kidney stone-specific health-related quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients aged 18 years or older with nonobstructing renal stones up to 10 mm in longest diameter and moderate to severe pain were recruited. All participants completed 3 questionnaires the Brief Pain Inventory BPI the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System pain interference form 6a and the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire. Thereafter all participants underwent ureteroscopy for renal stone treatment. All 3 questionnaires were repeated at 2 6 to 8 and at 12 weeks postprocedure. The primary outcomes were change in preoperative to 12-week postoperative mean BPI score and worst BPI pain score. RESULTS A total of 43 patients with nonobstructing kidney stones and associated flank pain were recruited. All stones were removed. Preoperatively BPI scores for mean pain and worst pain were 5.5 and 7.2 respectively which decreased to 1.8 and 2.8 respectively at 12 weeks postoperatively. Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire mean score increased from 70.4 to 115.3 at 12 weeks postoperatively. A total of 86 and 69 of patients had at least a 20 and 50 reduction in their mean pain scores respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study determined that patients benefit significantly from the removal of calyceal nonobstructing kidney stones for at least 12 weeks with a reduction in pain and an increase in quality of life. Therefore surgical removal of these stones in this patient population should be offered as a treatment option.",

Furthermore its clinical significance remains poorly defined. Using population based data we examined a large retrospective cohort of patients with sALL to determine the risk factors for and prognostic impact of sALL compared to ALL without preceding cancer.jatsp jatspMethods Patients diagnosed with ALL during 1988-2012 were identified in the California Cancer Registry CCR n15135. Cases were considered sALL if they were preceded by any other malignancy except primary acute leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia Burkitt leukemialymphoma lymphoblastic lymphoma or non-hodgkin lymphoma not otherwise specified. Non-menaloma skin cancer is not captured by CCR and thus was not included considered a first malignancy. We determined standard incidence ratios SIR for sALL by comparing expected rates of ALL from the CCR to observed rates in patients with a previous malignancy. Hematologic malignancies and breast thyroid and germ cell cancers were identified as potential high-risk patients in prior reports. SIRs for these tumors and for colorectal and prostate cancer due to their frequency were calculated. The effect of sALL compared to primary ALL on overall survival OS was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models accounting for age sex race year of diagnosis histology neighborhood socioeconomic status SES marital status and rural vs urban residence.jatsp jatspResults Secondary ALL accounted for 3.7 n566 of patients diagnosed with ALL in the CCR. Compared to primary ALL sALL was more common in females 43 vs 55 plt0.0001 non-Hispanic Whites 37 vs 62.9 plt0.0001 older patients 21 over the age of 40 vs 87 more likely to be diagnosed in 2008-2012 than before 23 vs 31 plt0.0001 and in patients residing in the highest two quintiles of SES 17 vs 22 p0.002 and 16 vs 27 plt0.0001 respectively. The most common first primary tumor sites among sALL patients were breast 14 male genital system 10 lymphoma 8 and digestive system 6.7. The primary tumor site was unknown in 30 of cases.jatsp jatspThe SIRs of developing sALL are summarized in the Table. Of note both men and women were more likely to develop ALL after a preceding malignancy than the background population overall SIR 1.7 95 CI 1.5 - 1.8 male SIR 1.4 1.2 - 1.6 and female SIR 2.0 1.8 - 2.4. While hematologic malignancies and endocrinethyroid cancers increased the risk in men and women germ cell tumors increased the risk of sALL only in men expectedly breast cancer increased the risk only in women.jatsp jatspCompared to primary ALL the adjusted hazard ratio aHR of death for patients with sALL was 1.07 0.96-1.18 p0.2. A second model considered type of prior malignancy to sALL hematologic malignancies solid tumors with statistically significant SIRs gt1 breast thyroid and germ cell and other tumors. Compared to primary ALL patients with sALL after a prior hematologic malignancy had a significantly increased risk of death aHR 1.38 1.07 - 1.8 while those with prior breastthyroidgerm cell aHR 1.18 0.95 - 1.46 or any other primary aHR 1.12 0.96 - 1.31 cancers did not.jatsp jatspConclusions To our knowledge this study represents the largest cohort of sALL reported to date and establishes sALL as a clinically relevant subtype of ALL. Although the risk of developing sALL is increased for patients with any prior malignancy only specific cancers provide excess risk. Furthermore the risk of death was increased in sALL patients with a prior hematologic cancer. Our findings provide evidence that sALL is clinically distinct entity and have implications for both survivorship of solid and hematologic cancer and risk stratification of ALL. Further study into the etiology of sALL and the possibility that sALL is therapy related is warranted.jatsp jatspTable 1.

    "abstract": "Extreme heatwaves and drought have been shown to significantly affect urban tree survival with potentially substantial economic costs for urban managers and local governments. During the 20192020 austral summer the western Sydney Local Government Area LGA of Penrith experienced unprecedented high temperatures with less than 60 of average rainfall compared with the proceeding five summers. This culminated in the highest temperature ever recorded in greater Sydney of 48.9 C. It is increasingly important that trees for urban applications are selected to be able to withstand such conditions. In early 2020 we conducted a visual assessment of canopy damage on street trees found in the Penrith LGA following the 20192020 summer heatwaves. We assessed the health of over 5500 trees and classified them as undamaged lightly damaged heavily damaged or defoliated. We found that more than 10 of all the trees assessed displayed some level of canopy damage with exotic deciduous species showing the greatest proportion of canopy damage. A logistic regression revealed that for exotic deciduous species the probability of having sustained no canopy damage was 79 lower than that for native evergreen species. Using these data the economic costs to replace damaged trees was calculated using two scenarios that incorporated costs of tree planting and maintenance low cost replacing all heavily damaged and defoliated trees with juvenile trees and high cost replacing all heavily damaged and defoliated trees with advanced trees with costs ranging from 500000 to 800000 AUD. We also calculated the cost of replacing all individuals of the most damaged species with more climate-resilient species in order to secure the urban forest and found that the cost would be over AUD1000000. This research highlights the importance of careful planning to ensure urban forest resilience and economic sustainability in the face of climate change.",

The procedure was used to cotransform rice with nine plasmids. Fertile transgenic plants R0 were regenerated from 66 cell lines and transgenic R1 and R2 seeds were harvested. Polymerase chain reaction PCR showed that all cell lines carried at least three genes and 11 cell lines carried all nine genes. Progeny segregation analysis indicated that in most cases multiple transgenes were integrated into the same locus of the rice genome resulting in a 31 segregation of transgenes. Expression analysis demonstrated that about 50 of the transgenes were expressed. Four of the transgenic lines each expressed eight transgenes. The transgenes were expressed in all three test generations R0 R1 and R2. The stable expression of multiple transgenes is important in metabolic engineering and molecular breeding.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Except for low thiamin content little is known about vitamins or macronutrients in milk from Cambodian mothers and associations among milk nutrients. OBJECTIVES We measured fat-soluble vitamins FSVs and water-soluble vitamins WSVs and macronutrients and explored internutrient associations in milk from Cambodian mothers. METHODS Milk from women aged 18-45 y 3-27 wk postpartum n 68 who participated in a thiamin-fortification trial were analyzed for vitamins B-2 riboflavin FAD B-3 nicotinamide B-5 B-6 pyridoxal pyridoxine B-7 B-12 A E -tocopherol and -tocopherol -TPH carotenoids carbohydrate CHO fat and protein. Milk vitamin B-1 thiamin thiamin monophosphate TMP thiamin pyrophosphate TPP was previously assessed for fortification effects. Milk nutrient concentrations were compared with the Adequate Intake AI values for infants aged 0-6 mo. Pearson correlation was used to examine internutrient associations after excluding nutrients affected by fortification. RESULTS Fortification increased thiamin and B-1 and decreased -TPH. Less than 40 of milk samples met the AIs for all vitamins and 10 samples did not reach any AI values for the analyzed nutrients. CHO fat and energy values were met in 1.5-11.8 and protein in 48.5 of the samples. Whereas fat protein and energy were related all r 0.5 P 0.001 and associated with FSVs and WSVs CHO correlated only with some WSVs. TPP was not correlated with B-1 vitamers but with other WSVs r 0.28-0.58 P 0.019. All FSVs except -carotene were correlated with each other r 0.42-0.98 P 0.002. TPP FAD B-2 and B-3 were associated with almost all FSVs r 0.24-0.63 P 0.044. CONCLUSIONS Cambodian women might not provide sufficient nutrients to their exclusively breastfeeding infants. Besides thiamin all other vitamins measured were much lower than the AI. There were many strong correlations among macronutrients and vitamins the extent to which these are explained by maternal diet milk volume maternal physiology or genetics requires additional exploration.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE We previously demonstrated lower early mortality for young adults YAs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL who received induction treatment at specialized cancer centers SCCs versus community hospitals. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of inpatient location of treatment throughout therapy on long-term survival complications and cost-associations that have not yet been evaluated at the population level. METHODS Using the California Cancer Registry linked to a hospitalization database we identified patients 0-39 years of age diagnosed with first primary ALL who received inpatient treatment between 1991 and 2014. Patients were classified as receiving all or part or none of their inpatient treatment at an SCC within 3 years of diagnosis. Inverse probability-weighted multivariable Cox regression models estimated the associations between location of treatment and sociodemographic and clinical factors with survival. We compared 3-year inpatient costs overall and per day by age group and location of care. RESULTS Eighty-four percent 0-18 years n 4549 of children and 36 of YAs 19-39 years n 683 received all treatment at SCCs. Receiving all treatment at an SCC was associated with superior leukemia-specific hazard ratio HR 0.76 95 CI 0.67 to 0.88 and overall survival HR 0.87 95 CI 0.77 to 0.97 in children and in YAs HR 0.71 95 CI 0.61 to 0.83 HR 0.70 95 CI 0.62 to 0.80 even after controlling for complications. The cost of inpatient care during the full course of therapy was higher in patients receiving all of their care at SCCs. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate that inpatient treatment at an SCC throughout therapy is associated with superior survival therefore strong consideration should be given to referring these patients to SCCs.",

Here we use tangle equations to analyze the topological changes associated with Xer recombination at psi. This mathematical method allows computation of all possible topological pathways consistent with the experimental data. We give a rigorous mathematical proof that under reasonable biological assumptions there are only three solutions to the tangle equations. One of the solutions corresponds to a synaptic complex with antiparallel alignment of recombination core sites the other two correspond to parallel alignment of cores. We show that all three solutions can be unified into a single three-dimensional model for Xer recombination. Thus the three distinct mathematical solutions do not necessarily represent distinct three-dimensional pathways and in this case the three distinct tangle solutions are different planar projections of the same three-dimensional configuration.",

It is often assumed that the template contents are veridical but recent studies have found that this is not true when the distractor set is linearly separable from the target e.g. all distractors are yellower than an orange-colored target. In such cases the target representation in memory shifts away from distractor features Navalpakkam Itti 2007 and develops a sharper boundary with distractors Geng DiQuattro Helm 2017. These changes in the target template are presumed to increase the target-to-distractor psychological distinctiveness and lead to better attentional selection but it remains unclear what characteristics of the distractor context produce shifting versus sharpening. Here we tested the hypothesis that the template representation shifts whenever the distractor set i.e. all of the distractors is linearly separable from the target but asymmetrical sharpening occurs only when linearly separable distractors are highly target-similar. Our results were consistent suggesting that template shifting and asymmetrical sharpening are 2 mechanisms that increase the representational distinctiveness of targets from expected distractors and improve visual search performance.

Compared with those with neither radiographic knee OA nor knee pain multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios HRs of mortality were 2.2 95 confidence interval 95 CI 1.6-3.1 for symptomatic knee OA 0.9 95 CI 0.6-1.4 for knee pain only and 2.0 95 CI 1.4-2.9 for radiographic knee OA only respectively. Indirect effects HRs of symptomatic knee OA on mortality via disability and PCS of QoL were 1.1 95 CI 1.0-1.4 and 1.2 95 CI 1.0-1.4 respectively. No apparent mediation effect was observed through either MCS of QoL or oral pain-relief medications use. CONCLUSION Participants with either symptomatic or radiographic knee OA were at an increased risk of All-cause mortality. Increased risk of mortality from symptomatic knee OA was partially mediated through its effect on disability and PCS of QoL.",

In this study a commercial bio-activator EM4 EM and a traditional bio-activator prepared according to the Takakura method Tak were investigated. The bio-activators were mixed with a fermenting bed fb material consisting of rice husk and rice bran mixed in a ratio of 11. The inoculated fb was then used in concentrations of 0 20 and 40 in a composting process of food waste. The composting process was monitored daily for 48 days and the quality of the final compost based on its physical and chemical characteristics was measured and compared. The result revealed that all samples containing 40 fb material with both Tak and EM bio- A ctivator contained lower moisture content in the final compost compared to samples with 20 fb material. The CN ratio of the samples with 20 fb material for all samples decreased to 201 while 40 fb material increased above 201 compared to its initial level. Furthermore the nitrogen level for all samples with 20 fb material increased while samples with 40 fb material decreased from the initial level. The phosphorus and potassium content also increased for all samples with both 20 and 40 fb material from the initial level. Additionally no significant difference could be found for the final compost quality between the two bio-activators.",

Deficits in imitation ability in persons with autism spectrum disorder ASD from toddlerhood into adulthood have also been repeatedly documented raising the possibility that early disruptions in imitation contribute to the onset of ASD and the deficits in language and social interaction that define the disorder. This study prospectively examined the development of imitation between 12 and 24 months of age in 154 infants at familial risk for ASD and 78 typically developing infants who were all later assessed at 36 months for ASD or other developmental delays. The study established a developmental measure of imitation ability and examined group differences over time using an analytic Rasch measurement model. Results revealed a unidimensional latent construct of imitation and verified a reliable sequence of imitation skills that was invariant over time for all outcome groups. Results also showed that all groups displayed similar significant linear increases in imitation ability between 12 and 24 months and that these increases were related to individual growth in both expressive language and ratings of social engagement but not in fine motor development. The group of children who developed ASD by age 3 years exhibited delayed imitation development compared with the low-risk typical outcome group across all time-points but were indistinguishable from other high-risk infants who showed other cognitive delays not related to ASD.",

We propose a Lyapunov-based predictive control design that guarantees stabilization and state and input constraint satisfaction for all times from an explicitly characterized set of initial conditions. An auxiliary Lyapunov-based analytical bounded control design is used to characterize the stability region of the predictive controller and also provide a feasible initial guess to the optimization problem in the predictive controller formulation. For the case when the state constraints are soft we propose a switched predictive control strategy that reduces the time during which state constraints are violated driving the states into the state and input constraints feasibility region of the Lyapunov-based predictive controller. We demonstrate the application of the Lyapunov-based predictive controller designs through a chemical process example. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

A polarization-diversity scheme allows the data and control planes to share the same physical link. The AO-TOKEN is more scalable than alternative electricaloptical solutions since it eliminates the need for a centralized electrical control plane. Our experimental results show that the technique can work over a wavelength-range of approx 23 nm using off-the-shelf components.

Identifying critical gaps and central hubs in food systems is of importance in addressing a variety of concerns such as navigating rapid shifts in marketing practices as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic and related food shortages. The constellation of growers and markets can also reinforce opportunities to shift growing and eating policies and practices with attention to addressing racial and income inequities in food system ownership and access. With this research we compare network methods for measuring centrality and sociospatial orientations in food systems using two of Americas most high-producing agricultural counties. Though the counties are adjacent we demonstrate that their community food systems have little overlap in contributing farms and markets. Our findings show that the community food system for Yolo County is tightly interwoven with Bay Area restaurants and farmers markets. The adjacent county Sacramento branded itself as Americas Farm-to-Fork capital in 2012 and possesses network hubs focused more on grocery stores and restaurants. In both counties the most central actors differ and have been involved with the community food system for decades. Such findings have implications beyond the case studies and we conclude with considerations for how our methods could be standardized in the national agricultural census.",

    "abstract": "The American Academy of Pediatrics AAP believes that an appropriately financed graduate medical education GME system is critical to ensuring that sufficient numbers of trained pediatricians are available to provide optimal health care to all children. A shortage of pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists currently exists in the United States and this shortage is likely to intensify because of the growing numbers of children with chronic health problems and special health care needs. It is equally important to maintain the supply of primary care pediatricians. The AAP therefore recommends that childrens hospital GME positions funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration be increased to address this escalating demand for pediatric health services. The AAP also recommends that GME funding for pediatric physician training provide full financial support for all years of training necessary to meet program requirements. In addition all other entities that gain from GME training should participate in its funding in a manner that does not influence curriculum requirements or outcomes. Furthermore the AAP supports funding for training innovations that improve the health of children. Finally the AAP recommends that all institutional recipients of GME funding allocate these funds directly to the settings where training occurs in a transparent manner.",

Methods Thirty-two patients with metastatic HB were enrolled on Childrens Oncology Group Protocol AHEP0731 and treated with vincristine and irinotecan VI. Responders to VI received two additional cycles of VI intermixed with six cycles of cisplatinfluorouracilvincristinedoxorubicin C5VD and nonresponders received six cycles of C5VD alone. Patients were imaged after every two cycles and at the conclusion of therapy. All computed tomography scans and pathology reports were centrally reviewed and information was collected regarding lung nodule number size laterality timing of resolution and pulmonary surgery. Results Among the 29 evaluable patients only 31 met Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST for measurable metastatic disease. The presence of measurable disease by RECIST the sum of nodule diameters greater than or equal to the cumulative cohort median size bilateral disease and 10 nodules were each associated with an increased risk for an event-free survival event P .48 P .08 P .065 P .03 respectively with nodule number meeting statistical significance. Ten patients underwent pulmonary resectionmetastasectomy at various time points the benefit of which could not be determined because of small patient numbers. Conclusion Children with metastatic HB have a poor prognosis. Overall tumor burden may be an important prognostic factor for these patients. Lesions that fail to meet RECIST size criteria ie those 10 mm at diagnosis may contain viable tumor whereas residual lesions at the end of therapy may constitute eradicated tumorscar tissue. Patients may benefit from risk stratification on the basis of the burden of lung metastatic disease at diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspAbstract 1653jatsp jatspMany non-Hodgkin lymphomas NHL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL initially respond to therapy but relapse at that point further treatment is often limited by chemotherapy-related toxicity. CD22 is a valid target for immunotherapy of NHL and ALL. We have shown that the anti-CD22 ligand blocking monoclonal antibody mAb HB22.7 has significant activity. Antibody drug conjugates ADC are emerging as the next generation of targeted therapies for lymphoid neoplasms as they may be designed to be effective but with manageable toxicity. We sought to determine if HB22.7 could be used as a platform for CD22-targeted ADCs for the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms. We describe here the effect H22.7-saporin SAP a novel ADC composed of HB22.7 and a ribosome inactivating protein on ALL and NHL models.jatsp jatspThe in vitro cytotoxicity of HB22.7-SAP was assessed using two pre-B cell ALL lines REH and JM1 and NHL cell lines Ramos Raji Granta 519 SU-DHL-4 and DOHH-2. HB22.7-SAP had IC50 values of 0.7 and 1.2 ngmL in ALL and 1.08.4 ngmL in the NHL cell lines. Free HB22.7 plus SAP did not have any cytotoxic effect using the same doses. HB22.7-SAP was not cytotoxic to CD22 negative Jurkat cells.jatsp jatspTo evaluate HB22.7-SAPs in vivo efficacy against a model of human ALL NODSCID mice were injected with REH leukemia cells. Twenty-four hours later the mice were treated with PBS free HB22.7 plus SAP or HB22.7-SAP. Treatment was continued twice weekly for 4 weeks. Mice were euthanized at the onset of hind limb paralysis. The median survival was 52 days as compared to 20 days for the untreated mice p lt 0.0005. Mice treated with HB22.7-SAP had normal blood counts over the study period. In contrast mice from the PBS or free HB22.7 plus free SAP groups developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia by day 20 coincident with development of ALL bone marrow from the two mice that developed hind limb paralysis confirmed ALL.jatsp jatspTo assess efficacy in a human model of NHL Raji cells were injected into the flank of previously radiated female athymic nude mice. Tumors grew until they reached 100200 mm3 day 0. Mice were then exposed to HB22.7-SAP PBS or free HB22.7 plus free SAP. Each treatment was administered intraperitoneally weekly for 3 weeks. To assess significance of starting tumor volume on HB22.7-SAP-mediated tumor growth inhibition a second model initiated therapy 24 hours after tumor implantation and used the same dose and drug schedule. During the first 14 days HB22.7-SAP 1 mgkg significantly inhibited tumor growth p lt 0.01 on days 5 and 8 as compared to the PBS and free HB22.7 plus free SAP control groups however by day 19 the average tumors volume of mice treated with HB22.7-SAP were no different than the controls. In contrast when HB22.7-SAP was administered 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of Raji cells no mice in the treatment group developed measureable tumors in the 50-day study period. There was no difference in hematologic toxicity between the groups however mice treated with HB22.7-SAP had more therapy-related weight loss.jatsp jatspThis study demonstrates the promising in vivo and in vitro activity of HB22.7 when used as a platform for CD22-targeted ADCs. The HB22.7-SAP ADC is both specific and cytotoxic to CD22 expressing malignant lymphocytes and that translates into significant efficacy against NHL and ALL. When compared to other anti-CD22 mAb we hypothesize that HB22.7-based ADCs will prove to be potent cytotoxic drugs in-part due to their unique ability to block ligand binding thus conferring an independent lymphocidal property.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Tilapia is a primary aquaculture fish in Thailand but little is known about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance AMR in Aeromonas hydrophila Salmonella spp. and Vibrio cholerae colonizing healthy tilapia intended for human consumption and the co-occurrence of these AMR bacteria in the cultivation water. METHODS This study determined the phenotype and genotype of AMR extended-spectrum -lactamase ESBL production and virulence factors of A. hydrophila Salmonella spp. and V. cholerae isolated from hybrid red tilapia and cultivation water in Thailand. Standard culture methods such as USFDAs BAM or ISO procedures were used for the original isolation with all isolates confirmed by biochemical tests serotyping and species-specific gene detection based on PCR. RESULTS A total of 278 isolates consisting of 15 A. hydrophila 188 Salmonella spp. and 75 V. cholerae isolates were retrieved from a previous study. All isolates of A. hydrophila and Salmonella isolates were resistance to at least one antimicrobial with 26.7 and 72.3 of the isolates being multidrug resistant MDR respectively. All A. hydrophila isolates were resistant to ampicillin 100 followed by oxytetracycline 26.7 tetracycline 26.7 trimethoprim 26.7 and oxolinic acid 20.0. The predominant resistance genes in A. hydrophila were mcr-3 20.0 followed by 13.3 of isolates having floR qnrS sul1 sul2 and dfrA1. Salmonella isolates also exhibited a high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin 79.3 oxolinic acid 75.5 oxytetracycline 71.8 chloramphenicol 62.8 and florfenicol 55.3. The most common resistance genes in these Salmonella isolates were qnrS 65.4 tetA 64.9 bla TEM 63.8 and floR 55.9. All V. cholerae isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested while the most common resistance gene was sul1 12.0. One isolate of A. hydrophila was positive for int1 while all isolates of Salmonella and V. cholerae isolates were negative for integrons and int SXT. None of the bacterial isolates in this study were producing ESBL. The occurrence of mcr-3 20.0 in these isolates from tilapia aquaculture may signify a serious occupational and consumer health risk given that colistin is a last resort antimicrobial for treatment of Gram-negative bacteria infections. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this study on AMR bacteria in hybrid red tilapia suggest that aquaculture as practiced in Thailand can select for ubiquitous AMR pathogens mobile genetic elements and an emerging reservoir of mcr and colistin-resistant bacteria. Resistant and pathogenic bacteria such as resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline or MDR Salmonella circulating in aquaculture together highlight the public health concerns and foodborne risks of zoonotic pathogens in humans from cultured freshwater fish.",

    "abstract": "Aim This study aimed to compare mortality risks across uric acid UA levels between non-diabetes adults and participants with diabetes and to investigate the association between hyperuricemia and mortality risks in low-risk adults. Methods We analyzed data from adults aged 18 years without coronary heart disease and chronic kidney disease n 29226 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010 and the associated mortality data up to December 2011. We used the Cox proportional hazards models to examine the risk of all-cause and cause-specific cardiovascular disease CVD and cancer mortality at different UA levels between adults with and without diabetes. Results Over a median follow-up of 6.6 years 2069 participants died 495 from CVD and 520 from cancers. In non-diabetes adults at UA 5 mgdL all-cause and CVD mortality risks increased across higher UA levels p-for-trend 0.037 and 0.058 respectively. The lowest all-cause mortality risk in participants with diabetes was at the UA level of 5-7 mgdL. We set the non-diabetes participants with UA levels of 7 mgdL as a reference group. Without considering the effect of glycemic control the all-cause mortality risk in non-diabetes participants with UA levels of 7 mgdL was equivalent to risk among diabetes adults with UA levels of 7 mgdL hazard ratio 1.44 vs. 1.57 p 0.49. A similar result was shown in CVD mortality risk hazard ratio 1.80 vs. 2.06 p 0.56. Conclusion Hyperuricemia may be an indicator to manage multifaceted cardiovascular risk factors in low-risk adults without diabetes but further studies and replication are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Autistic youth are at high risk for increased anxiety. Access to mental health care is challenging particularly for youth from diverse communities. Facing Your Fears in Schools FYF-S is a manualized group CBT intervention to manage anxiety in autistic students and can be delivered by interdisciplinary school providers ISPs. Training mental health MH and non-mental health non-MH providers to deliver FYF-S may increase the capacity to meet the mental health needs of autistic students. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were differences in knowledge and perceptions among MH versus non-MH providers. Seventy-seven ISPs participated in a FYF-S training. CBT knowledge was measured pre- and post-training readiness to deliver FYF-S was measured post-training. ISPs delivered FYF-S to 39 students with autism or suspected autism and anxiety. Post-intervention ISPs rated program acceptability appropriateness and feasibility. Although there were significant differences in CBT knowledge pre-training MH and non-MH providers showed significant improvements in CBT knowledge post-training. Providers did not significantly differ in knowledge nor readiness to deliver FYF-S. Post-intervention MH and non-MH providers did not demonstrate significant differences in program acceptability appropriateness or feasibility. Preliminary qualitative comparison of intervention groups with a MH provider and those led by non-MH providers did not reveal differences in FYF-S fidelity or student anxiety outcomes. This study provides encouraging evidence that training ISPs to deliver a manualized CBT intervention may be a promising approach to increasing access to much-needed MH services for autistic youth.",

RESULTS Animals with intraocular 4 dogs and 1 cat or conjunctival 3 dogs and 1 cat lymphoma represented 0.1 and 0.08 of patients with lymphoma evaluated at the hospital during the study period respectively. Animals with intraocular lymphoma represented 0.19 of all patients with uveitis animals with conjunctival lymphoma represented 0.16 of all patients with conjunctivitis. Tumors included B-cell 2 intraocular and 1 conjunctival non-B-cell non-T-cell 1 intraocular and T-cell 3 conjunctival neoplasms immunophenotype of 2 uveal lymphomas was not determined. Treatments included enucleation 4 intraocular and chemotherapy 3 intraocular and 2 conjunctival. All dogs with intraocular lymphoma developed neurologic signs. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 2 patients with conjunctival lymphoma. Median PFST and OST were 178 days for all animals with PSOL dogs with PSOL and animals with intraocular lymphoma. Median PFST and OST for animals with conjunctival lymphoma were 221 and 549 days respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated PSOL was uncommon but should be considered a differential diagnosis for animals with uveitis or conjunctivitis. Performance of MRI and cytologic analysis of CSF and regional lymph node aspirate samples may be beneficial for such patients. Prognosis seemed to be better for animals with conjunctival lymphoma than it was for those with intraocular lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is now the only solid organ cancer in which therapy is commonly applied to the whole gland. One of the main challenges in adopting focal boost or true focal therapy is in the accurate mapping of cancer foci defined on magnetic resonance MR images onto the computerised tomography CT images used for radiotherapy planning. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prostate cancer patients n 14 previously treated at the Edinburgh Cancer Centre ECC were selected for this study. All patients underwent MR scanning for the purpose of diagnosis and staging. Patients received three months of androgen deprivation hormone therapy followed by a radiotherapy planning CT scan. The dominant focal prostate lesions were identified on MR scans by a radiologist and a novel image analysis approach was used to map the location of the dominant focal lesion from MR to CT. An offline planning study was undertaken on suitable patients n 7 to investigate boosting of the radiation dose to the tumour using a stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy SABR technique. RESULTS The non-rigid registration algorithm showed clinically acceptable estimates of the location of the dominant focal disease on all CT image data of patients suitable for a boost treatment. Standard rigid registration was found to produce unacceptable estimates of the dominant focal lesion on CT. A SABR boost dose of 47.5 Gy was delivered to the dominant focal lesion of all patients whilst meeting all dose-volume histogram DVH constraints. Normal tissue complication probability NTCP for the rectum decreased from 1.28 to 0.73 with this method. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results demonstrate the potential of this image analysis method for reliably mapping dominant focal disease within the prostate from MR images onto planning CT images. Significant dose escalation using a simultaneous integrated SABR boost was achieved in all patients.",

    "abstract": "Although having a family history of breast cancer is a well established breast cancer risk factor it is not known whether it influences mortality after breast cancer diagnosis. We studied 4153 women with first primary incident invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1991 and 2000 and enrolled in the Breast Cancer Family Registry through population-based sampling in Northern California USA Ontario Canada and Melbourne and Sydney Australia. Cases were oversampled for younger age at diagnosis andor family history of breast cancer. Carriers of germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were excluded. Cases and their relatives completed structured questionnaires assessing breast cancer risk factors and family history of cancer. Cases were followed for a median of 6.5 years during which 725 deaths occurred. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate associations between family history of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and risk of all-cause mortality after breast cancer diagnosis adjusting for established prognostic factors. The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 0.98 95 confidence interval CI 0.84-1.15 for having at least one first- or second-degree relative with breast cancer and 0.85 95 CI 0.70-1.02 for having at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer compared with having no such family history. Estimates did not vary appreciably when stratified by case or tumor characteristics. In conclusion family history of breast cancer is not associated with all-cause mortality after breast cancer diagnosis for women without a known germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Therefore clinical management should not depend on family history of breast cancer.",

In low- and middle-income countries however economic factors prevent many patients from receiving complete treatment even as government and insurance entities lack complete data on the costs for ALL therapies. Here we analyzed the overall costs for pediatric ALL therapies and their constitutive elements. PROCEDURE All cost information was drawn from our hospital database. We analyzed the costs of 45 newly diagnosed children with ALL from May 2005 to June 2006 20 were classified into low-risk group 25 into medium-risk group and all had completed the ALL-2005 protocol treatment. Forty cases were B-lineage four were T-lineage and one was double-lymphoid lineage. RESULTS Average total clinic expense per person was US 3694.58 - 1376.85. Average total in-hospital expense per patient was US 7299.48 - 6526.39 with a large individual difference. Medicine and laboratory test costs represented 40.5 and 21.5 respectively. Patients stayed at home or attended clinic for more than 90 of the therapy period. In-hospital and clinic constituted 66.4 and 33.6 of costs respectively. Costs among risk groups and withwithout severe complications differed significantly P 0.05. Thirty-month event-free survivals were 94.14 and 82.81 for the low- and medium-risk groups respectively. CONCLUSION Risk group and severe complications were main factors affecting total medical costs. Average overall costs for childhood ALL in this study were less than US 11000 with reasonable clinical results.",

Although hypoalbuminemia has been attributed to malnutrition evidence of inflammation C-reactive protein CRP and cytokine levels has recently been recognized to predict albumin concentration in dialysis patients. We measured CRP and albumin levels in October 1995 in 91 hemodialysis HD patients. During a 34-month follow-up period we determined the incidence and cause of death. Patients were divided into four groups based on serum albumin levels 3.5 lowest quartile 3.5 to 3.8 3.9 to 4.0 and 4.0 gdL highest quartile. Survival differed among the four groups P 0.0063. Patients with albumin levels greater than 4.0 gdL had the greatest survival. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of patients from varying CRP quartiles 2.6 2.6 to 5.2 5.3 to 11.5 and 11.5 microgmL differed among the four groups P 0.0001. The group with the greatest CRP level 11.5 microgmL had the lowest survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that only CRP level chi-square 21.11 P 0.0001 and age chi-square 5.44 P 0.020 predicted death. Albumin level chi-square 0.16 P 0.69 was not predictive. Only when CRP was excluded from the model did low serum albumin level chi-square 12. 04 P 0.0004 predict death. CRP level chi-square 16.79 P 0. 0001 and age chi-square 6.38 P 0.012 also superceded albumin level chi-square 0.45 P 0.51 in predicting cardiovascular mortality. Although values for blood urea nitrogen creatinine and normalized protein catabolic rate were significantly less among patients who died these parameters as well as cholesterol level and diabetes were not important predictors of death in multivariate analysis. The acute-phase response or the cause of the acute-phase response is largely responsible for the effect of hypoalbuminemia on mortality in HD patients.",

This formula is different from the one given by Hatayama et al. and is valid for all crystal paths based on Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules not just for the symmetric and antisymmetric case. The fermionic formula can be interpreted in terms of a new set of unrestricted rigged configurations. For the proof a statistics preserving bijection from this new set of unrestricted rigged configurations to the set of unrestricted crystal paths is given which generalizes a bijection of Kirillov and Reshetikhin. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Like the physical process of weaving fabric weaving CURAPs involve creative and collaborative uses and responses to tension between all elements of a partnership. This is especially true in long-term partnerships intended to address systemic environmental injustices. This case highlights the power relationships and challenges associated with such partnerships and presents several lessons to enrich the scholarship and practices of action research.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Constrictive pericarditis CP is an uncommon disease that limits both cardiac relaxation and contraction. Patients often present with right-sided heart failure as the pericardium thickens and impedes cardiac filling. Pericardiectomy is the treatment of choice for improving hemodynamics in CP patients however the procedure carries a high morbidity and mortality and the anesthetic management can be challenging. Acute heart failure bleeding and arrhythmias are all concerns postoperatively. METHODS After IRB approval we performed the retrospective analysis of 66 consecutive patients with CP who underwent pericardiectomy from July 2018 to May 2022. RESULTS Most patients had significant preoperative comorbidities including congestive hepatopathy 75.76 New York Heart Association Type IIIIV heart failure 59.09 and atrial fibrillation 51.52. Despite this 75.76 of patients were extubated within the first 24 h and all but 2 of the patients survived to discharge 96.97. CONCLUSIONS Anesthetic management including a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of CP the use of advanced monitoring and transesophageal echocardiography TEE guidance all played an important role in patient outcomes.",

Researchers and mental health professionals at all levels of career development can use several media resources to assist them with the technical aspects of preparing an abstract or a poster. This article will focus on major principles associated with preparing and presenting an abstract and a poster at a scientific meeting. A literature search using NIH PubMed was conducted to identify peer and nonpeer-reviewed articles that provide methods for effective abstract and poster presentation for the period of 1966 to June 2014. First the author reviews the purpose and relative importance of abstracts and posters in academic settings. Next the author describes the qualities of an effective abstract and poster and common pitfalls that may occur. Finally the author presents a systematic approach to preparing and presenting an abstract and a poster in a scientific setting. Several sources consistently suggest that readability organization and succinctness are qualities that make an effective and successful abstract and poster. Mental health professionals in all stages of their career development may benefit from following these guidelines in presenting their scientific work.",

    "abstract": "Successful ab initio folding of proteins with both alpha-helix and beta-sheet requires a delicate balance among a variety of forces in the simulation model which may explain that the successful folding of any alphabeta proteins to within experimental error has yet to be reported. Here we demonstrate that it is an achievable goal to fold alphabeta proteins with a force field emphasizing the balance between the two major secondary structures. Using our newly developed force field we conducted extensive ab initio folding simulations on an alphabeta protein full sequence design FSD employing both conventional molecular dynamics and replica exchange molecular dynamics in combination with a generalized-Born solvation model. In these simulations the folding of FSD to the native state with high population 64.2 and high fidelity Calpha-Root Mean Square Deviation of 1.29 A for the most sampled conformation when compared to the experimental structure was achieved. The folding of FSD was found to follow two pathways. In the major pathway the folding started from the formation of the helix. In the minor pathway however folding of the beta-hairpin started first. Further examination revealed that the helix initiated from the C-terminus and propagated toward the N-terminus. The formation of the hydrophobic contacts coincided with the global folding. Therefore the hydrophobic force does not appear to be the driving force of the folding of this protein.",

The computed network is sufficiently informative to address the question Is the ranking network for a rhesus macaque society more like a kingdom or a corporation Our computations are based on a three-step approach. These steps are devised to deal with the tremendous challenges stemming from the transitivity of dominance as a necessary constraint on the ranking relations among all individual macaques and the very high sampling heterogeneity in the behavioral conflict data. The first step simultaneously infers the ranking potentials among all network members which requires accommodation of heterogeneous measurement error inherent in behavioral data. Our second step estimates the social rank for all individuals by minimizing the network-wide errors in the ranking potentials. The third step provides a way to compute confidence bounds for selected empirical features in the social ranking. We apply this approach to two sets of conflict data pertaining to two captive societies of adult rhesus macaques. The resultant ranking network for each society is found to be a sophisticated mixture of both a kingdom and a corporation. Also for validation purposes we reanalyze conflict data from twenty longhorn sheep and demonstrate that our three-step approach is capable of correctly computing a ranking network by eliminating all ranking error.",

We compared state regulations for childcare with best practices to support breastfeeding and healthy beverage provision. METHODS We reviewed regulations for childcare centers centers and family childcare homes homes in effect May-July 2016 and rated all 50 states for inclusion 1 not included 2 partially included 3 fully included of 12 breastfeeding and beverage best practices. We calculated average ratings for 6 practices specific to infants aged 0-11 months 6 practices specific to children aged 1-6 years and all 12 practices by state and across all states. We assessed significant differences between centers and homes for each best practice by using McNemar-Bowker tests for symmetry and we assessed differences across states by using paired student t tests. RESULTS States included best practices in regulations for centers more often than for homes. Average ratings standard deviations in regulations across all states were significantly higher in centers than in homes for infant best practices 2.1 0.5 vs 1.8 0.5 P .001 child best practices 2.1 0.6 vs 1.8 0.6 P .002 and all 12 best practices combined 2.1 0.5 vs 1.8 0.6 P .001. CONCLUSIONS Although best practices were more consistently included in regulations for centers than for homes many state childcare regulations did not include best practices to support breastfeeding and the provision of healthy beverages. Findings can be used to inform efforts to improve regulations and to reduce differences between centers and homes.",

In ideal solutions it is exact but many solutions are known to have substantial deviations from Raoults law as conventionally interpreted. In 1908 Callendar showed that water hydrated to the solute can explain some of the departures from Raoults law in aqueous solution. Here we show that by simply assuming equilibria between the free water in solution and its hydrated forms Raoults law and Callendars extension are valid over the full range of concentrations while also showing how water and solutes interact in solution. This model of solutions has importance in highly concentrated solutions common in atmosphere aerosols relevant to climate change and air quality and in numerous industrial processes.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE The b-wave of the cone ERG increases in amplitude and speed during the first few minutes of adaptation to a rod-suppressing background light. Earlier studies implicate rod pathway input to the cone pathway in these changes. METHODS The timing and amplitude of the cone b-wave and isolated oscillatory potentials OP during the first 10 minutes of light adaptation in wild-type WT mice and two mutant lines without functional rods was examined rhodopsin knockout Rho-- lacking rod outer segments and NRL knockout Nrl-- in which rods are replaced by S-cones. Expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos which is increased in the inner retina by light-induced activity was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in dark- and light-adapted retinas. RESULTS WT b-wave and OP amplitudes increased and implicit times decreased during light adaptation. Subtracting OP did not alter b-wave changes. Rho-- b-wave and OP amplitudes did not increase during adaptation. B-wave timing and amplitude and the timing of the major OP at 1 minute of adaptation were equivalent to WT at 10 minutes. The light-adapted ERG b-wave in Nrl-- mice which originates in both the rod and cone pathways changed in absolute amplitude and timing similar to WT. C-fos expression was present in the inner retinas of dark-adapted Rho-- but not WT or Nrl-- mice. CONCLUSIONS Activity in the distal rod pathway produces changes in the cone ERG during light adaptation. Rods in Rho-- mice constitutively activate this rod-cone pathway interaction. The rod pathway S-cones in Nrl-- mice may maintain the WT interaction.",

Folding events have been observed in multiple trajectories and the best folded structures achieved root-mean-square deviation RMSD of 2.0 A. The folding of this three-helix bundle protein followed a diffusion-collision process where substantial formation of the individual helices was critical and preceded the global packing. Owing to the difference in the intrinsic helicity helix I formed faster than the other two helices. The order of the formation of helices II and III varied in different trajectories indicating heterogeneity of the folding process. The slightly shifted boundaries of the helical segments had direct impact on the global packing suggesting room for improvement on the simulation force field and solvation model.",

    "abstract": "Natural resource management decisions can be based on incomplete knowledge when they lack scientific research monitoring and assessment andor simultaneously fail to draw on local ecological knowledge. Many community-based forestry organizations in the United States attempt to address these knowledge gaps with an integrated ecological stewardship approach that balances ecological social and economic goals. This paper examines the use and integration of local knowledge and conventional science in ecological stewardship and monitoring by seven community-based forestry demonstration projects. Through document reviews and interviews with both participants and partners of all of these communitybased organizations we found that all the community-based forestry groups incorporated local ecological knowledge into many aspects of their management or monitoring activities such as collaboratively designing monitoring programs with local ranchers forest workers and residents involving local people in collecting data and interpreting results and documenting the local ecological knowledge of private forest landowners long-time residents and harvesters of nontimber forest products. We found that all the groups also used conventional science to design or conduct ecological assessments monitoring or research. We also found evidence in the form of changes in attitudes on the part of local people and conventional scientists and jointly produced reports that the two types of knowledge were integrated by all groups. These findings imply that community-based forestry groups are redistributing the power of conventional science through the use of diverse knowledge sources. Still several obstacles prevented some local traditionally under-represented groups from being significantly involved in monitoring and management decisions and their knowledge has not yet been consistently incorporated.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate for the first time an entirely molecular beam epitaxy MBE approach to high-quality GaAs planar coalescence over embedded dielectric microstructures. Specifically an all-MBE approach was achieved by developing a new two-stage growth process merging the MBE growth regimes of III-flux modulated lateral epitaxial overgrowth LEO with self-ordered planarization of nonplanar substrates to produce highly selective planar coalescence specifically for embedding 010-aligned silica gratings patterned on 001 substrates. The resulting planar coalescence returned a smooth 001 surface with surface roughness as low as 3 nm root-mean-square and photoluminescence PL equivalent to grating-free controls. In demonstrating high-quality GaAs coalescence we also report for the first time an intentionally enhanced single InGaAsGaAsAlAs quantum well PL test structure seamlessly grown directly above embedded silica gratings leading to a 1.4 enhancement in PL as a result of both Purcell and extraction enhancements corroborated by time-resolved PL studies. As a result we provide a significant advance to the long-standing challenge of marrying high-quality semiconductor crystal growth with dielectric microstructures unlocking several high-impact applications such as enhanced quantum emitters and embedded metasurfaces for quantum information processing and provide a pathway for all-MBE metamorphic III-V heteroepitaxy.",

However to utilize XFEL sources efficiently demands the continuous rapid delivery of a large number of difficult-to-handle microcrystals to the x-ray beam. A recently developed fixed-target system in which crystals of interest are enclosed within a sample holder which is rastered through the x-ray beam is discussed in detail in this Perspective. The fixed target is easy to use maintains sample hydration and can be readily modified to allow a broad range of sample types and different beamline requirements. Recent innovations demonstrate the potential of such microfluidic-based fixed targets to be an all-around workhorse for serial crystallography measurements.

    "abstract": "Multiple datasets of two consecutive vintages of replicated grape and wines from six different deficit irrigation regimes are characterized and compared. The process consists of four temporal-ordered signature phases harvest field data juice composition wine composition before bottling and bottled wine. A new computing paradigm and an integrative inferential platform are developed for discovering phase-to-phase pattern geometries for such characterization and comparison purposes. Each phase is manifested by a distinct set of features which are measurable upon phase-specific entities subject to the common set of irrigation regimes. Throughout the four phases this compilation of data from irrigation regimes with subsamples is termed a space of media-nodes on which measurements of phase-specific features were recoded. All of these collectively constitute a bipartite network of data which is then normalized and binary coded. For these serial bipartite networks we first quantify patterns that characterize individual phases by means of a new computing paradigm called Data Mechanics. This computational technique extracts a coupling geometry which captures and reveals interacting dependence among and between media-nodes and feature-nodes in forms of hierarchical block sub-matrices. As one of the principal discoveries the holistic year-factor persistently surfaces as the most inferential factor in classifying all media-nodes throughout all phases. This could be deemed either surprising in its over-arching dominance or obvious based on popular belief. We formulate and test pattern-based hypotheses that confirm such fundamental patterns. We also attempt to elucidate the driving force underlying the phase-evolution in winemaking via a newly developed partial coupling geometry which is designed to integrate two coupling geometries. Such partial coupling geometries are confirmed to bear causal and predictive implications. All pattern inferences are performed with respect to a profile of energy distributions sampled from network bootstrapping ensembles conforming to block-structures specified by corresponding hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED To gain insights into the diversity of Pseudomonas syringae sensu lato affecting sweet cherry in California we sequenced and analyzed the phylogenomic and genomic architecture of 86 fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic cherry tissues. Fifty-eight isolates were phylogenetically placed within the P. syringae species complex and taxonomically classified into five genomospecies P. syringae pv. syringae P. syringae Pseudomonas cerasi Pseudomonas viridiflava and A. We annotated components of the type III secretion system and phytotoxin-encoding genes and correlated the data with pathogenicity phenotypes. Intact probable regulatory protein HrpR was annotated in the genomic sequences of all isolates of P. syringae pv. syringae P. syringae P. cerasi and A. Isolates of P. viridiflava had atypical probable regulatory protein HrpR. Syringomycin and syringopeptin-encoding genes were annotated in isolates of all genomospecies except for A and P. viridiflava. All isolates of P. syringae pv. syringae caused cankers leaf spots and fruit lesions in the field. In contrast all isolates of P. syringae and P. cerasi and some isolates of P. viridiflava caused only cankers. Isolates of genomospecies A could not cause any symptoms suggesting phytotoxins are essential for pathogenicity. On detached immature cherry fruit pathogenicity assays isolates of all five genomospecies produced symptoms black-dark brown lesions. However symptoms of isolates of genomospecies A were significantly P 0.01 less severe than those of other genomospecies. We also mined for genes conferring resistance to copper and kasugamycin and correlated these data with in vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests. IMPORTANCE Comprehensive identification of phytopathogens and an in-depth understanding of their genomic architecture particularly virulence determinants and antibiotic-resistant genes are critical for several practical reasons. These include disease diagnosis improved knowledge of disease epidemiology pathogen diversity and determination of the best possible management strategies. In this study we provide the first report of the presence and pathogenicity of genomospecies Pseudomonas cerasi and Pseudomonas viridiflava in California sweet cherry. More importantly we report a relatively high level of resistance to copper among the population of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 47.5. This implies copper cannot be effectively used to control bacterial blast and bacterial canker of sweet cherries. On the other hand no isolates were resistant to kasugamycin an indication that kasugamycin could be effectively used for the control of bacterial blast and bacterial canker. Our findings are important to improve the management of bacterial blast and bacterial canker of sweet cherries in California.",

We used data from the Womens Health Initiative to examine the associations of sleep duration insomnia and use of sleep aids with death from cardiovascular disease CVD cancer other causes and all causes combined. METHODS Cox proportional hazards models were used in the analysis of baseline data and in time-dependent analyses of repeated measures to estimate associations of sleep-related factors with mortality. Among 158203 women with information regarding sleep 30400 total deaths 8857 CVD deaths 9284 cancer deaths and 11928 other deaths were ascertained over a median of 17.8 years. RESULTS In both baseline and time-dependent analyses both short 5 h and long sleep 9 h durations were associated with increased risk of total CVD and other deaths but not with cancer deaths. Insomnia showed no association with mortality whereas use of sleep medications was associated with an increased mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS While our findings showed a small but robust association of sleep duration with mortality in postmenopausal women studies including objective measurements of sleep quality and efficiency are needed to clarify these associations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic focused national attention on food insecurity equity and the role of school meal programs in supporting children families and communities. In doing so the pandemic created a rare policy window-an opportunity to advance a longstanding public health goal of guaranteed access to free school meals for all students. In July 2021 California and Maine became the first states to authorize school meal for all legislation also known as universal free meals. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore perspectives of policymakers state agency officials and advocates on the conditions and mechanisms that facilitated passage of school meal for all legislation in California and Maine. DESIGN A qualitative case study was conducted. PARTICIPANTS Between December 2021 and June 2022 semistructured interviews were conducted with 30 policymakers state agency officials and advocates. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED Interviews were analyzed using principles of content analysis. Key themes are organized using Kingdons multiple streams framework for public policy. RESULTS Eleven key themes were identified. Lessons are drawn from the policy and advocacy strategies used to advance laws in California and Maine. For instance paving the way with incremental policy change tailoring messaging to diverse audiences and organizing at the grassroots and grasstops levels were critical to success of advocacy efforts. CONCLUSIONS Promising practices can guide efforts to expand access to school meals and advance other child nutrition policies in other states and nationally. Moving forward lessons learned from implementation of universal free school meal legislation in California Maine and other early adopters should be documented and shared.",

Using a mouse xenograft model of kidney cancer characterized by subcapsular implantation of Caki-1 clear cell human kidney cancer cells we examined tissue serum and urine all obtained simultaneously at baseline urine and at or close to animal sacrifice urine tissue and plasma. Uniform metabolomics analysis of all three matrices was accomplished using gas chromatography- and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Of all the metabolites identified 267 in tissue 246 in serum and 267 in urine 89 were detected in all 3 matrices and the majority was altered in the same direction. Heat maps of individual metabolites showed that alterations in serum were more closely related to tissue than was urine. Two metabolites cinnamoylglycine and nicotinamide were concordantly and significantly when corrected for multiple testing altered in tissue and serum and cysteine-glutathione disulfide showed the highest change 232.4-fold in tissue of any metabolite. On the basis of these and other considerations three pathways were chosen for biologic validation of the metabolomic data resulting in potential therapeutic target identification. These data show that serum metabolomics analysis is a more accurate proxy for tissue changes than urine and that tryptophan degradation yielding anti-inflammatory metabolites is highly represented in renal cell carcinoma and support the concept that PPAR- antagonism may be a potential therapeutic approach for this disease.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Hospital length of stay LOS is utilized to estimate resource utilization and quality of care. In burns the LOS estimation is 1day per percent total body surface area burn 1dayTBSA. Our purpose was to evaluate the 1dayTBSA burn rule and develop simple accurate formulas to predict LOS. METHODS The American Burn Association National Burn Repository NBR from 2000 to 2013 was utilized to collate data on patients 18 years. We divided 106543 records in half utilizing one set to develop a model training set and the other to test the model test set. We calculated the difference between observed and predicted LOS for all patients and then examined the effect of inhalation injury and age using a linear regression model containing TBSA age inhalation injury and all two-way interactions. We compared predictive performance of the linear regression model to the 1dayTBSA rule. Finally we developed and validated three simple formulas to more accurately predict LOS than the 1day TBSA rule. RESULTS LOS was significantly associated with patient age TBSA inhalation injury and all two-way interactions. For patients 40 years without inhalation injury the main effect of TBSA was 0.71. For each decade increase in age LOS increased by 0.74daysTBSA burn inhalation injury added 1.70days. LOS was highly variable among patients with similar burn size age and inhalation injury due to concomitant trauma complications and comorbidities. We developed 3 formulas to estimate patient LOS 1 inhalation injury present regardless of age 2 no inhalation injury and 40 years old 3 no inhalation injury and 40 years old. CONCLUSIONS Traditional LOS estimates of 1dayTBSA burn rule is biased underestimating LOS particularly for patients 40 years with inhalation injury. The following formulas applied at admission can accurately estimate hospital LOS improve prediction over 1dayTBSA and provide results comparable to complicated models.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Limited data are available on whether donor kidneys with diffuse glomerular fibrin thrombi GFT are safe to use. In this study the clinicopathologic characteristics of allografts with diffuse donor-derived GFT were examined. METHODS All deceased donor kidney transplant implantation biopsies from our institution between July 2011 and February 2018 with diffuse GFT were included. A control group for comparison consisted of all cases with implantation biopsies obtained during the study period without diffuse GFT. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records for all study patients including donor information. RESULTS Twenty-four recipients received kidneys with diffuse GFT from 16 deceased donors. All donors died from severe head trauma. On average 79 of glomeruli contained fibrin thrombi. Nineteen cases had subsequent biopsy all revealed resolution of GFT. Compared with the control group kidneys with diffuse GFT had longer cold ischemia time 34 versus 27 h were more frequently pumped using machine perfusion 100 versus 81 and recipients experienced a higher frequency of delayed graft function 58 versus 27. Only 2 grafts with diffuse GFT failed within the first year. Overall graft survival was similar between the diffuse GFT group and control group. CONCLUSIONS Deceased donor kidneys with diffuse GFT appear to be safe to use given that nearly 92 of recipients in this cohort who received such allografts experienced good clinical outcomes. Histologically GFT demonstrated rapid resolution following transplantation. Interestingly diffuse GFT only occurred in donors who suffered severe head trauma in this cohort which may be a predisposing factor.",

    "abstract": "A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field FF is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF C27 and C27r systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature selected torsional Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical QM and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 12-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine DPPC bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids DPPC 12-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine DMPC 12-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine DLPC 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine POPC 12-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine DOPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine POPE simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2 and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters SCD are well predicted with the new FF including proper splitting of the SCD for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC POPE and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of 13C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly the presented lipid FF referred to as C36 allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble NPT and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.",

This study sought to better understand the sensitivity of these temperatures to ambient environmental conditions and ultimately how they influence various CWSIs. The surface energy balance was modeled to simulate the impacts of input parameter variation on leaf temperature and reference surface temperatures used to calculate four different CWSIs. The performance of the CWSIs were assessed based on their ability to maximize sensitivity to stomatal conductance while minimizing the relative sensitivity to ambient environmental conditions. The sensitivity analyses indicated that all four CWSIs performed poorly in shaded conditions as they had relatively low sensitivity to stomatal conductance and were sensitive to all environmental parameters. Two CWSIs had high sensitivity to stomatal conductance and low sensitivity to all environmental parameters except wind speed. None of CWSIs could remove sensitivity to all environmental parameters while retaining sensitivity to stomatal conductance.",

The model is based on an exponential function which encompasses three parameters Initial performance learning rate and asymptotic performance. These learning parameters were compared in a positional learning task administered to a sample comprising the whole adult lifespan N 527 age range 20 years to 89.3 years Mage 52.95 SDage 17.37. Additionally three explanatory variables age speed of information processing and educational level were included in the analyses. All three learning parameters showed reliable individual differences. The correlations between the learning parameters indicated that those participants with high learning rates needed more trials to achieve their asymptotic performance and those who recalled more items initially also had a higher asymptotic performance. Older persons showed lower initial performance and lower asymptotic performance whereas speed of information processing was positively associated only with initial performance. Persons with more years of formal education had a higher initial performance and a higher asymptotic performance. The learning rate in turn appeared to be unaffected by all three predictor variables. 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

We use the reproductively isolated UC Davis fatty Zucker strain rat model in which the defective chromosome 4 leptin receptor LeprfaStefaSte results in fatty obesity. We previously produced a congenic strain with the distal half of chromosome 1 from the Brown Norway strain BN on a Zucker ZUC background BN.ZUC-D1Rat183-D1Rat90. Previously published studies in males showed that the BN congenic donor region protects from some phenotypes of renal dysfunction and T2D. We now expand our studies to include females and expand phenotyping to gene expression. We performed diabetes and kidney disease phenotyping in chow-fed females of the BN.ZUC-D1Rat183-D1Rat90 congenic strain to determine the specific characteristics of the UC Davis model. Fatty LeprfaStefaSte animals of both BN and ZUC genotype in the congenic donor region had prediabetic levels of fasting blood glucose and blood glucose 2 hours after a glucose tolerance test. We observed significant congenic strain chromosome 1 genotype effects of the BN donor region in fatty females that resulted in decreased food intake urine volume glucose area under the curve during glucose tolerance test plasma triglyceride levels and urine glucose excretion per day. In fatty females there were significant congenic strain BN genotype effects on non-fasted plasma urea nitrogen triglyceride and creatinine. Congenic region genotype effects were observed by quantitative PCR of mRNA from the kidney for six genes all located in the chromosome 1 BN donor region with potential effects on T2D or kidney function. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the BN genotype chromosome 1 congenic region influences traits of both type 2 diabetes and kidney function in fatty UC Davis ZUC females and that there are many positional candidate genes.",
