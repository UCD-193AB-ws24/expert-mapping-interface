Towards this end, the law specifically mandates a 75% reduction of organic waste, including food waste (FW), from landfills by 2025. However, current infrastructural capacity to treat this diverted organic waste is limited throughout the state, so new facilities will need to be built to treat these valuable waste flows. The purpose of this study is to investigate ideal size and scale of new facilities that maximize FW treatment and minimize GHG emissions. To do so, this study uses a case study of Los Angeles County to model a decentralized network of small-scale, containerized anerobic digestors (ADs) for treatment of FW in the region. A spatial FW dataset developed for this study is used with a novel iterative-descent clustering model to simulate potential “FW-sheds” of ADs using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate a range of model results and a GHG analysis of FW collection is used to compare systems of two different AD capacities. The results of this analysis show that food waste is ideal for recycling at relatively small spatial scales as hauling burden of FW is reduced in these systems. The proposed infrastructure modeling approach is a first step of developing a zero net energy infrastructural solution that promotes a circular economy of food in direct response to SB 1383 and, more broadly, global climate change.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wildfires are a global concern due to their wide-ranging environmental, economic, and public health impacts. Climate change contributes to an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires making smoke exposure a more significant and recurring health concern for individuals with airway diseases. Some of the most prominent effects of wildfire smoke exposure are asthma exacerbations and allergic airway sensitization. Likely due to the delayed recognition of its health impacts in comparison with cigarette smoke and industrial or traffic-related air pollution, research on the composition, the mechanisms of toxicity, and the cellular/molecular pathways involved is poor or non-existent. SUMMARY: This review discusses potential underlying pathological mechanisms of wildfire-smoke-related allergic airway disease and asthma. We focused on major gaps in understanding the role of wildfire smoke composition in the development of airway disease and the known and potential mechanisms involving cellular and molecular players of oxidative injury at the epithelial barrier in airway inflammation. We examine how PM2.5, VOCs, O3, endotoxin, microbes, and toxic gases may affect oxidative stress and inflammation in the respiratory mucosal barrier. We discuss the role of AhR in mediating smoke's effects in alarmin release and IL-17A production and how glucocorticoid responsiveness may be impaired by IL-17A-induced signaling and epigenetic changes leading to steroid-resistant severe airway inflammation. KEY MESSAGE: Effective mitigation of wildfire-smoke-related respiratory health effects would require comprehensive research efforts aimed at a better understanding of the immune regulatory effects of wildfire smoke in respiratory health and disease.",

      "abstract": "To advance ongoing efforts to diversify the healthcare field and promote inclusion in physiology education, the present study investigates the potential for an evidence-based intervention, Scientist Spotlight assignments, to highlight counterstereotypical representations of scientists in the context of majors and nonmajors physiology courses. Undergraduate students at an emerging Hispanic serving R1 institution completed six Scientist Spotlights assignments in their physiology courses. We conducted semistructured interviews and disseminated an established pre- and postsurvey protocol at the beginning and end of the courses. Our findings from interviews with 31 students from a range of marginalized backgrounds revealed that 1) the biographical information about counterstereotypical scientists deeply resonated with students by humanizing science, 2) the instructor's implementation of the assignments made a meaningful difference in their feelings of inclusion, and 3) the assignments supported students' beliefs about their content learning and understanding of physiological concepts. The results from the survey showed that regardless of being in a major (n = 159) or nonmajor (n = 117) course, students from a range of demographic groups can and do significantly shift in their relatability to and descriptions of scientists. We highlight implications for inclusive curricula like Scientist Spotlights for addressing the issue of representation in physiology textbooks, curriculum, and healthcare fields at large.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Scientist Spotlights significantly enhance undergraduate students' feelings of inclusion and learning in undergraduate physiology courses at an emerging Hispanic-serving institution. By engaging with assignments featuring counterstereotypical scientists, students in both majors and nonmajors physiology courses shifted in their relatability to and descriptions of scientists. These results suggest that an inclusive curriculum, combined with supportive instructor practices, can positively impact student success and representation in physiology education.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Challenging aortoiliac anatomy such as short neck and narrow access vessels is responsible for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) ineligibility in up to 50% of cases. The Ovation stent graft helped widen the range of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) suitable for EVAR thanks to its low-profile delivery system and polymer-filled sealing rings. However, its advantages are offset by a tight sizing chart that can lead to increased risk of type Ia endoleak or endograft infolding from under- or oversizing, respectively. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel endovascular technique developed to expand the use of the Ovation endograft while avoiding these issues. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent EVAR with the Ovation endograft at our institution between March 2019 and December 2020. \"Aortic Balloon Molding\" or ABM is a novel endovascular technique in which the graft is pre-cannulated and a compliant aortic balloon is inflated at the site of the graft's sealing rings during polymer administration. The technique was preferentially performed in patients with hostile neck anatomy (HNA) defined as any or all of angulation >60°, reverse taper configuration, ≥50% circumferential thrombus, or calcification. Patients undergoing traditional deployment were compared to those in whom ABM was performed. End points included neck-related adjunctive procedures, technical success, type Ia endoleak at completion angiogram, and 1-year freedom from type Ia endoleak and migration. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included in the study, of which 26 (60.5%) were treated with the ABM technique. Mean follow-up was 7.9 ± 6 months. Patients in the ABM group were more likely to have a reverse taper neck (61.5% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.1), have significant circumferential thrombus or calcium (23.1% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.1), and be treated outside of the Ovation indications for use regarding anatomic characteristics (65.4% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.1). Technical success was achieved in 100% of cases. However, patients in the ABM group were less likely to require a neck-related adjunctive procedure (7.7% vs. 23.5%, P = 0.1). Only 1 type Ia endoleak was observed at completion angiogram in a patient treated without ABM. At 1 year, freedom from type Ia endoleak or migration was 100% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: ABM proves to be a safe and effective adjunctive technique for the treatment of AAAs with HNA using the Ovation stent graft. This may allow optimal endograft sizing to achieve adequate seal in complex aortic anatomies. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this technique.",

We conducted synchronous aerosol particle measurements with two aerosol mass spectrometers at different heights on a meteorological tower in urban Beijing to investigate the variations in particulate composition, sources and size distributions in response to emission controls. Our results show consistently large reductions in secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) of 61-67% and 51-57%, and in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) of 55% and 37%, at 260 m and ground level, respectively, during the APEC summit. These changes were mainly caused by large reductions in accumulation mode particles and by suppression of the growth of SIA and SOA by a factor of 2-3, which led to blue sky days during APEC commonly referred to as \"APEC Blue\". We propose a conceptual framework for the evolution of primary and secondary species and highlight the importance of regional atmospheric transport in the formation of severe pollution episodes in Beijing. Our results indicate that reducing the precursors of secondary aerosol over regional scales is crucial and effective in suppressing the formation of secondary particulates and mitigating PM pollution.",

      "abstract": "The forced transfer of children from one group to another is considered an element of the crime of genocide, yet this subject has attracted little scholarly attention. Using the history of the mass transfer of Armenian children during the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1922 as a case, this article argues that the study of child transfer and recovery is critical to both the history of human rights and a more sophisticated understanding of genocide, including the forms of genocide accompanying the colonial encounter. The experience of transferred children and their recovery or loss can help better clarify the historical relationship between the concepts of the rights of the child and individual human and minority rights as these have evolved before and immediately after World War II. Moreover, this article also contends that it is important to characterize child transfer as genocide, as opposed to colonial assimilation or acculturation as a feature of modernization, when explaining the broader social impact of mass violence, forced migration, and cultural destruction on victim/survivor and perpetrator communities. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Plaque psoriasis, which is the most common manifestation of psoriasis, is located on one end of the spectrum, dominated by adaptive immune responses, whereas the rarer pustular psoriasis lies on the opposite end, dominated by innate and autoinflammatory immune responses. In recent years, genetic studies have identified six genetic variants that predispose to pustular psoriasis, and these have highlighted the role of IL-36 cytokines as central to pustular psoriasis pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the presentation and clinical subtypes of pustular psoriasis, contribution of genetic predisposing variants, critical role of the IL-36 family of cytokines in disease pathophysiology, and treatment perspectives for pustular psoriasis. We further outline the application of appropriate mouse models for the study of pustular psoriasis and address the outstanding questions and issues related to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in pustular psoriasis.",

To test these hypotheses, we examined Stroop performance in 40 DSM-IV schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy control subjects, using a range of neutral stimuli (color patches, noncolor words, color words not in the response set). The findings confirmed several of our predictions and the results were consistent with the hypothesis that abnormal Stroop performance in schizophrenia reflects a failure to adequately attend to the task-appropriate stimulus dimension (color). This inattention affects both the congruent and incongruent conditions and multiple points in the information processing pathway.",

      "abstract": "Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein component of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and plays a central role in cholesterol metabolism. The lipid-free/lipid-poor form of apoA-I is the preferred substrate for the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). The interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 leads to the formation of cholesterol laden high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, a key step in reverse cholesterol transport and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. Knowledge of the structure of lipid-free apoA-I is essential to understanding its critical interaction with ABCA1 and the molecular mechanisms underlying HDL biogenesis. We therefore examined the structure of lipid-free apoA-I by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Through site directed spin label EPR, we mapped the secondary structure of apoA-I and identified sites of spin coupling as residues 26, 44, 64, 167, 217 and 226. We capitalize on the fact that lipid-free apoA-I self-associates in an anti-parallel manner in solution. We employed these sites of spin coupling to define the central plane in the dimeric apoA-I complex. Applying both the constraints of dipolar coupling with the EPR-derived pattern of solvent accessibility, we assembled the secondary structure into a tertiary context, providing a solution structure for lipid-free apoA-I.

As such, blueprinting represents a recent manifestation of regionalist approaches to environmental policy and planning. Focusing on the Sacramento region, an early adopter of blueprint planning, we use archival data and media sources to reconstruct the development of blueprinting and then we turn to an analysis of the performance of the blueprinting approach in relation to three successive planning efforts. We find that despite the promise of blueprinting, very little progress has been made toward actually changing the regional transportation system and land use patterns. The net result of this long-term planning effort aimed at achieving sustainable transportation land use is that total CO2 emissions increase over time at historical rates. We close with a discussion of what this means for regional planning and achieving goals set by California's landmark climate change legislation.",

In contrast to the psychoanalytic critical tradition, which presumes masculinity to be produced in conflict with women and/or femininity, I demonstrate masculinity to be a function not only of gender, but of age. The Winter's Tale explores the consequences of the early modern conception of boyhood as lying on a continuum with manhood, a conception reinforced by early modern views of the role of games in male development. I suggest that Leontes and Polixenes turn to games to affirm their connection to boyhood but that the drama problematizes this strategy by depicting these characters as collapsing boyhood and manhood, with pathological results. Whereas Leontes ultimately progresses toward normative early modern manhood—using recreation to recommit to his marriage and accept old age—Polixenes regresses, remaining fixated on youth and boyhood games. In this way The Winter's Tale questions as it produces a linear narrative of male development, folding back on itself to portray the cyclical nature of the aging process.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, behind only heart disease and cancer. With an estimated three million survivors of stroke in the United States, the cost to society, both directly in health care and indirectly in lost income, is staggering. Despite recent advances in basic and clinical neurosciences, which have the potential to improve the treatment of acute stroke, the general approach to the acute stroke patient remains one of therapeutic nihilism. Most basic science studies show that to be effective, acute intervention to reperfuse ischemic tissue must take place within the first several hours, as is the case with ischemic myocardium. In addition, most neuroprotective agents must also be administered within a short time frame to be effective at salvaging at-risk tissue. Recent studies have suggested that the outcome after intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage is improved with early intervention. However, most stroke patients fail to present to medical attention within this short \"window of opportunity.\" The public's knowledge about stroke is woefully inadequate. However, clinicians who deal with stroke can use the dramatic changes in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction over the last 2 decades as a guide for shaping changes in the management of acute stroke. Comprehensive educational efforts aimed at clinicians and the public at large have dramatically reduced the time from symptom onset to presentation and treatment for acute myocardial infarction, enabling treatment methods such as thrombolysis to be effective. The Decade of the Brain offers a unique opportunity to all concerned with the treatment of the patient with acute stroke to engage in a concerted effort to bring patients with a \"brain attack\" to specialized neurological attention within the same timeframe that the \"heart attack\" patient is handled. Such an effort is justified because, although at the present time there are few therapeutic interventions of \"proven\" value in the treatment of acute stroke, there is more than sufficient suggestive evidence that a number of approaches may be beneficial within the first few hours after the onset of the stroke.",

Across six studies (N = 1,309), we provide evidence for a motivational theory of the arousal–WOM relationship, highlighting the importance of the WOM's valence (positive vs. negative) as well as the consumer's salient type of arousal (energetic vs. tense; Thayer, 1989). In doing so, we demonstrate that consumers use WOM as an arousal management strategy: They are motivated to engage in positive WOM to maintain or increase their energetic arousal and to engage in negative WOM to reduce or eliminate their tense arousal. These findings also demonstrate the importance of the WOM recipient's response for the WOM source to achieve his/her desired arousal state. Thus, this work both expands our understanding of the arousal–WOM relationship and provides a framework for interpreting past work and conducting future investigations into when and how consumers will engage in WOM.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a subanalysis of data collected from a large-scale qualitative project regarding older adults' experiences in using health information technology. Specifically, the subanalysis explored older adults' experiences with technology support from family members to inform strategies for promoting older adults' engagement with new health technologies. Although the primary analysis of the original study was theoretically driven, this paper reports results from an inductive, open-coding analysis. METHODS: This is a subanalysis of a major code identified unexpectedly from a qualitative study investigating older adults' use experience of a widespread health technology, the patient portal. A total of 24 older patients (≥65 years) with multiple chronic conditions (Charlson Comorbidity Index >2) participated in focus groups conducted at the patients' primary clinic. While conducting the primary theoretically driven analysis, coders utilized an open-coding approach to ensure important ideas not reflected in the theoretical code book were captured. Open coding resulted in 1 code: family support. This subanalysis further categorized family support by who provided tech support, how tech support was offered, and the opinions of older participants about receiving family tech support. RESULTS: The participants were not specifically asked about family support, yet themes around family assistance and encouragement for technology emerged from every focus group. Participants repeatedly mentioned that they called their grandchildren and adult children if they needed help with technology. Participants also reported that family members experienced difficulty when teaching technology use. Family members struggled to explain simple technology tasks and were frustrated by the slow teaching process. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that older adults ask their family members, particularly grandchildren, to support them in the use of new technologies. However, family may experience difficulties in providing this support. Older adults will be increasingly expected to use health technologies, and family members may help with tech support. Providers and health systems should consider potential family support and engagement strategies to foster adoption and use among older patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In nature, obligate herbivorous ruminants have a close symbiotic relationship with their gastrointestinal microbiome, which proficiently deconstructs plant biomass. Despite decades of research, lignocellulose degradation in the rumen has thus far been attributed to a limited number of culturable microorganisms. Here, we combine meta-omics and enzymology to identify and describe a novel Bacteroidetes family (\"Candidatus MH11\") composed entirely of uncultivated strains that are predominant in ruminants and only distantly related to previously characterized taxa. RESULTS: The first metabolic reconstruction of Ca. MH11-affiliated genome bins, with a particular focus on the provisionally named \"Candidatus Paraporphyromonas polyenzymogenes\", illustrated their capacity to degrade various lignocellulosic substrates via comprehensive inventories of singular and multi-modular carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes). Closer examination revealed an absence of archetypical polysaccharide utilization loci found in human gut microbiota. Instead, we identified many multi-modular CAZymes putatively secreted via the Bacteroidetes-specific type IX secretion system (T9SS). This included cellulases with two or more catalytic domains, which are modular arrangements that are unique to Bacteroidetes species studied to date. Core metabolic proteins from Ca. P. polyenzymogenes were detected in metaproteomic data and were enriched in rumen-incubated plant biomass, indicating that active saccharification and fermentation of complex carbohydrates could be assigned to members of this novel family. Biochemical analysis of selected Ca. P. polyenzymogenes CAZymes further iterated the cellulolytic activity of this hitherto uncultured bacterium towards linear polymers, such as amorphous and crystalline cellulose as well as mixed linkage β-glucans. CONCLUSION: We propose that Ca. P. polyenzymogene genotypes and other Ca. MH11 members actively degrade plant biomass in the rumen of cows, sheep and most likely other ruminants, utilizing singular and multi-domain catalytic CAZymes secreted through the T9SS. The discovery of a prominent role of multi-modular cellulases in the Gram-negative Bacteroidetes, together with similar findings for Gram-positive cellulosomal bacteria (Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and anaerobic fungi (Orpinomyces sp.), suggests that complex enzymes are essential and have evolved within all major cellulolytic dominions inherent to the rumen.",

The Huisgen cycloaddition (\"click chemistry\") between the azide group and monoalkyne group led to formation of a triazole linkage between ε-polylysine and curcumin. The conjugation process was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Retention of functional activity of conjugated curcumin was evaluated by comparing the antioxidant activity of conjugates with native ε-polylysine using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. FT-IR spectra showed a significant decrease in the peak intensity of azide group of ε-polylysine (2102cm-1) and a concomitant presence of triazole peak (1459cm-1) after reaction with monoalkyne curcumin, validating that conjugation was successful. ORAC assay showed that the antioxidant activity of ε-polylysine-curcumin conjugate was 3.6 fold higher than control ε-polylysine indicating that conjugated curcumin retained its functional properties.

After noticing reporting heterogeneity in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we speculated that a standardized synoptic report could improve gastroenterologist comprehension. OBJECTIVE.—: To investigate the effect of a synoptic table on gastroenterologist comprehension of IBD pathology reports. DESIGN.—: We recruited gastroenterology fellows and faculty to participate in this study. All participants were given 6 pathology reports and asked if the following were present: active inflammation, chronic inflammation, IBD, and dysplasia. Participants were also asked to rate their confidence. After a 6-week washout period, the same questionnaire was distributed with a synoptic report. We performed paired t-tests to compare the mean accuracy and confidence scores between the preintervention and postintervention responses. RESULTS.—: A total of 39 physicians participated: 9 fellows and 30 faculty. Mean accuracy scores were higher after the intervention (0.81 versus 0.86; P < .001). Mean confidence was also higher after intervention, but this was not statistically significant (3.91 versus 3.98; P = .24). CONCLUSIONS.—: The improvement in accuracy scores after intervention confirms that clinician comprehension improved with the synoptic table.

Despite broad calls for primary prevention, few programs with demonstrated effectiveness exist. This cluster-randomized trial examined the effectiveness of a DV perpetration prevention program targeting coaches and high school male athletes. METHODS: The unit of randomization was the high school (16 schools), and the unit of analysis was the athlete (N = 2,006 students). Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene, recognition of abusive behaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary outcomes explored bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Regression models for clustered, longitudinal data assessed between-arm differences in over-time changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes in 1,798 athletes followed up at 3 months. RESULTS: Intervention athletes' changes in intentions to intervene were positive compared with control subjects, resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12 (95% CI: .003, .24). Intervention athletes also reported higher levels of positive bystander intervention behavior than control subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, .38). Changes in gender-equitable attitudes, recognition of abusive behaviors, and DV perpetration were not significant. Secondary analyses estimated intervention impacts according to intensity of program implementation. Compared with control subjects, athletes exposed to full-intensity implementation of the intervention demonstrated improvements in intentions to intervene (.16, 95% CI: .04, .27), recognition of abusive behaviors (.13, 95% CI: .003, .25), and positive bystander intervention (.28, 95% CI: .14, .41). CONCLUSION: This cluster-randomized controlled trial supports the effectiveness of a school athletics-based prevention program as one promising strategy to reduce DV perpetration.",

Reflecting on how AI technologies diverge from technologies studied in the past, we propose a new perspective, which considers technology as a counterpart in a system of work that includes its design, implementation, and use. This perspective encourages developing a grounded understanding of how AI intersects with work, and therefore ethnography, building on thick descriptions, is an apt approach.

      "abstract": "While economic theory highlights the usefulness of flexible exchange rates in promoting adjustment in international relative prices, flexible exchange rates also can be a source of destabilizing shocks. We find that when countries joining the euro currency union abandoned their national exchange rates, the adjustment of real exchange rates toward their long-run equilibrium surprisingly became faster. To investigate, we distinguish between differing rates of purchasing power parity (PPP) convergence conditional on alternative shocks, which we refer to as “conditional PPP.” We find that the loss of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism after the introduction of the euro was more than compensated by the elimination of the exchange rate as a source of shocks, in combination with faster adjustment in national prices. These findings support claims that flexible exchange rates are not necessary to promote long-run international relative price adjustment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2012, nearly one-third of adults 65 years or older with Medicare discharged to home after hospitalization were referred for home health care (HHC) services. Care coordination between the hospital and HHC is frequently inadequate and may contribute to medication errors and readmissions. Insights from HHC nurses could inform improvements to care coordination. OBJECTIVE: To describe HHC nurse perspectives about challenges and solutions to coordinating care for recently discharged patients. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a descriptive qualitative study with six focus groups of HHC nurses and staff (n = 56) recruited from six agencies in Colorado. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a mixed deductive/inductive approach to theme analysis with a team-based iterative method. KEY RESULTS: HHC nurses described challenges and solutions within domains of Accountability, Communication, Assessing Needs & Goals, and Medication Management. One additional domain of Safety, for both patients and HHC nurses, emerged from the analysis. Within each domain, solutions for improving care coordination included the following: 1) Accountability-hospital physicians willing to manage HHC orders until primary care follow-up, potential legislation allowing physician assistants and nurse practitioners to write HHC orders; 2) Communication-enhanced access to hospital records and direct telephone lines for HHC; 3) Assessing Needs & Goals-liaisons from HHC agencies meeting with patients in hospital; 4) Medication Management-HHC coordinating directly with clinician or pharmacist to resolve discrepancies; and 5) Safety-HHC nurses contributing non-reimbursable services for patients, and ensuring that cognitive and behavioral health information is shared with HHC. CONCLUSIONS: In an era of shared accountability for patient outcomes across settings, solutions for improving care coordination with HHC are needed. Efforts to improve care coordination with HHC should focus on clearly defining accountability for orders, enhanced communication, improved alignment of expectations for HHC between clinicians and patients, a focus on reducing medication discrepancies, and prioritizing safety for both patients and HHC nurses.",

Nonetheless, it illustrates a dilemma that young men like him faced in the troubled years preceding Syrian independence: As French-educated young men, should they take their places as minor functionaries in the colonial machine and accept the promise of a comfortable and privileged life, or should they join the growing political and ideological struggle to found an independent, national statein Syria? Al-Arsuzi, who is venerated by the current regime in Damascus as the ideological father of Baʾthism, went on to answer this question by spending the next eight years in and out ofthe former Ottoman province of Alexandretta, working in support of the Arab-nationalist cause. Both his contemporary writings and later recollections of the period reveal a growing political consciousness and the formulation of a complex Arabism that was at odds with the dominant ideology emanating from the large cities of Syria. This ideology, as embodied by the National Bloc government in Damascus, was personality-based, hamstrung by European colonial interests, and unable to arouse any sustained political sensibility in the broader population; it centered its political legitimacy and parochial brand of nationalism on opposition to the French occupation. Al-Arsuzi and others, recognizing the weakness inherent in this form of nationalism, drew away from its leadership in the course of the 1930s and moved to create other, more radical and militant Pan-Arabist groups.</jats:p>",

Dose calculations with the planning CT deformed to cone beam CT (CBCT) have shown promise for estimating the \"dose of the day\". The purpose of this study is to investigate the \"dose of the day\" calculation accuracy based on CBCT and deformable image registration (DIR) for lung cancer radiotherapy. METHODS: A total of 12 lung cancer patients were identified, for which daily CBCT imaging was performed for treatment positioning. A re-planning CT (rCT) was acquired after 20 Gy for all patients. A virtual CT (vCT) was created by deforming initial planning CT (pCT) to the simulated CBCT that was generated from deforming CBCT to rCT acquired on the same day. Treatment beams from the initial plan were copied to the vCT and rCT for dose calculation. Dosimetric agreement between vCT-based and rCT-based accumulated doses was evaluated using the Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Mean differences in dose-volume metrics between vCT and rCT were smaller than 1.5%, and most discrepancies fell within the range of ± 5% for the target volume, lung, esophagus, and heart. For spinal cord Dmax , a large mean difference of -5.55% was observed, which was largely attributed to very limited CBCT image quality (e.g., truncation artifacts). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a reasonable agreement in dose-volume metrics between dose accumulation based on vCT and rCT, with the exception for cases with poor CBCT image quality. These findings suggest potential utility of vCT for providing a reasonable estimate of the \"dose of the day\", and thus facilitating the process of ART for lung cancer.",

Physical distancing from social contacts also created emotional distancing: it was harder to maintain affective connections via online platforms and within the isolating context of shelter-in-place. Due to emerging adulthood being a sensitive window for social development, the COVID-19 pandemic-induced emotional distancing could have long-term ramifications for this cohort's relationships over the course of their lives.",

The association of low energy use with deprivation has been an obstacle to promoting more aggressive goals for reduction of residential use. However, there is little research on the composition of the low user population. We investigated the demographics, behavior, and satisfaction of the lowest 10% of electricity consumers in Sacramento, CA, to see what attributes best correlated with low use. California, like many other regions, has GHG emissions goals requiring drastic reductions in residential consumption. Households in Sacramento’s lowest decile of electricity consumption already live at electricity consumption levels consistent with the goals for 2050. Our investigation of 700 of these households found that diversity of low users with regard to age, income, education, appliance ownership, and dwelling characteristics is similar to that of the general population. Low-use households tend to be smaller, but not enough to explain the entirety of low usage. Surveys and interviews revealed that those in the lowest 10% typically pursued low consumption deliberately and enthusiastically and were aware of their status as low users. Conversations about energy conserving strategies were embedded in their social lives. They employed diverse and creative strategies to maintain thermal comfort without excess energy use, often exceeding expert recommendations. Finally, the distribution of self-reported quality of life was no different from that of the general population living at much higher consumption levels. Overall, the key determinants of low use were a positive engagement with improvisation and experimentation, and the salience of energy in personal or social life. The population of low users should be treated as a valuable source of peer advice and lifestyle modeling.",

Advocacy groups and patients identify family planning clinics as the preferred sites to lead PrEP implementation for women in the United States. However, limited qualitative exploration exists of U.S. family planning practitioners' attitudes toward integrating PrEP into their work. METHODS: We conducted qualitative focus groups with a convenience sample of family planning clinicians, counselors, and clinic managers to explore barriers and facilitators to PrEP provision in U.S. family planning clinics. RESULTS: We conducted six focus groups (total participants = 37) with respondents who worked in family planning clinics in San Francisco, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Key themes emerged highlighting how PrEP at times runs contrary to other family planning agendas, including efficient clinic visits, condom promotion, and long-acting reversible contraception counseling. Throughout these discussions, participants expressed discomfort with HIV vulnerabilities rooted in social and structural determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that those seeking to implement PrEP for U.S. cisgender women may benefit from exploring 1) how to integrate patient/provider conversations about the structural determinants of health and their relationship to HIV and other sexual and reproductive health outcomes and 2) how to foster person-centered prevention conversations in the context of busy family planning visits.",

The purpose of the present study was to replicate and extend findings on gaze avoidance in SAD via eye tracking during a computerized social simulation. Patients with SAD (n = 27) and a (sub)sample of demographically-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 22) completed a computerized, dynamic social simulation task involving video clips of actors giving positive and negative social feedback to the participant. All participants were unknowingly eye tracked during the simulation, and post-study consent was obtained to examine responses. Consistent with the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model of social anxiety, fear of positive evaluation related systematically to state anxiety in response to positive social feedback, and fear of negative evaluation related systematically to state anxiety in response to negative social feedback. Moreover, compared to HCs, SAD patients exhibited significantly greater global gaze avoidance in response to both the positive and negative video clips. Our results provide strong additional support for gaze avoidance as a biobehavioral marker of SAD, as well as additional support for the BFOE model. Implications for the assessment and treatment of SAD are discussed.",

We triangulate on these questions with multiple methods (longitudinal, experimental, and field studies), diverse population samples (MBA students, employees, and professional repatriates), and both laboratory and real-world measures. Using a longitudinal design over a 10-month MBA program, Study 1 found that intercultural dating predicted improved creative performance on both divergent and convergent thinking tasks. Using an experimental design, Study 2 established the causal connection between intercultural dating and creativity: Among participants who had previously had both intercultural and intracultural dating experiences, those who reflected on an intercultural dating experience displayed higher creativity compared to those who reflected on an intracultural dating experience. Importantly, cultural learning mediated this effect. Extending the first 2 studies, Study 3 revealed that the duration of past intercultural romantic relationships positively predicted the ability of current employees to generate creative names for marketing products, but the number of past intercultural romantic partners did not. In Study 4, we analyzed an original dataset of 2,226 professional repatriates from 96 countries who had previously worked in the U.S. under J-1 visas: Participants' frequency of contact with American friends since returning to their home countries positively predicted their workplace innovation and likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs. Going out with a close friend or romantic partner from a foreign culture can help people \"go out\" of the box and into a creative frame of mind. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Increasing situational awareness, identifying errors and near misses, and reporting them using organizational incident reporting systems enables mitigation of harm. METHODS: We designed and tested a brief, interactive, and easily replicable simulation activity for medical students, and emergency medicine interns and pediatric interns to strengthen their skills and enhance their self-efficacy in identifying and reporting patient safety hazards. Hazards fell into the categories of situational safety, patient identification and privacy, infection prevention, treatment errors, and issues with electronic health records (EHRs). RESULTS: The simulation training significantly increased the self-efficacy of medical students and interns in identifying and reporting patient safety hazards. Learners were very satisfied with the simulation training, successfully recognized key patient safety hazards, provided feedback to improve the training, and improved their ability to report hazards through organizational incident reporting systems. Patient safety hazards associated with patient misidentification were recognized most frequently, whereas safety hazards associated with EHRs were missed with the greatest frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation training enabled learners to identify hazards and near misses and enhanced their ability to report hazards through organizational incident reporting systems. Learners at all levels of training identified safety hazards at comparable rates, which demonstrates the role that trainees play in critically observing clinical settings with fresh eyes and identifying and reporting patient safety hazards. Interventions to promote patient safety need to prioritize building situational awareness of potential hazards associated with EHR use.",

This study explored the beliefs of older Chinese Americans toward colorectal cancer screening modalities, including fecal occult blood testing (FOBT). DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted 30 semistructured, open-ended, qualitative interviews in Mandarin and Cantonese, focusing on colorectal cancer prevention and health-seeking behavior. Participants were Chinese patients 50-79 years of age recruited from a community clinic in Seattle, Washington. RESULTS: When asked about colorectal cancer prevention, interviewees discussed such concepts as maintenance of positive energy (qi) and spirit (jing shen) and moderation of exercise and diet. Until prompted, participants did not discuss FOBT. Interviewees believed that colorectal cancer was caused by diets high in foods with \"heat\" (huo qi) or by intestinal toxins from frequent constipation. Participants presumed that FOBT is unnecessary in the absence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in our study expressed beliefs about health promotion and causes of colorectal cancer that differed from Western biomedical concepts. Failure to recognize these different beliefs may create inadvertent confusion among elderly Chinese-American patients. Health promotion programs to increase colorectal cancer screening must incorporate these concepts to improve cultural relevance among Chinese-American patients.",

Spouses are often the primary caregivers for people living with CMD, and understanding patients' and partners' conceptions of CMD could inform care. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 couples having a partner living with HIV and either hypertension or diabetes. Couples were recruited from HIV clinics in Malawi and were interviewed on beliefs around symptoms, causation, prevention, and treatment for CMD. Data were analyzed at the individual and dyadic levels using framework analysis and Kleinman's theory of explanatory models as a lens. On average, participants were 51 years old and married for 21 years. Approximately 57%, 14%, and 80% had hypertension, diabetes, and HIV. Couples endorsed a combination of biomedical explanatory models (beliefs around physical and mental health) and traditional explanatory models (beliefs around religion and natural remedies), although tended to emphasize the biomedical model. Half of couples believed stress was the main cause of hypertension. For diabetes, diet was believed to be a common cause. In terms of prevention, dietary changes and physical activity were most frequently mentioned. For disease management, medication adherence and diet modifications were emphasized, with some couples also supporting herbal remedies, stress reduction, and faith in God as strategies. Participants were generally more concerned about CMD than HIV due to poor access to CMD medications and beliefs that CMD could lead to sudden death. Within couples, partners often held many of the same beliefs but diverged around which etiological or preventive factors were most important (e.g., stress versus diet) and the best diet for CMD. Health education programs should involve primary partners to build knowledge of CMD and address overlap with HIV, and reinforce accurate information on lifestyle factors for the prevention and treatment of CMD.",

The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.",

      "abstract": "Consuming too much fat, sugar, and salt is associated with adverse health outcomes. Food reformulation is one possible strategy to enhance the food environment by improving the nutritional quality of commercial products. However, food reformulation faces many hindrances. One way to alleviate some of these hindrances is to embrace a multicriteria approach that is based on a market inventory. In this objective, additional sensory screening and water content analyses allow going beyond nutrition and composition information on the packaging. However, due to feasibility reasons for later in-depth analyses, it is necessary to work with several reduced and manageable products. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in the literature, there is no sample selection approach taking into account multiple criteria as a base for future food reformulation. The overall aim of this paper is to propose a method to select the best representative products from the market base, for future reformulation by going beyond nutrition and composition information on the packaging. This approach considered therefore nutrition, composition, economic, water content, and sensory information with the example of the cookies market. The first step is the creation of an extensive cookie database including sensory and water content information. In total 178 cookies among the French market were identified, then focus was placed on 62 chocolate chip cookies only. Sensory screening and water content analyses of all 62 products were conducted. The second step is to make an informed subset selection, thanks to a cluster analysis based on 11 nutrition, composition, and water content variables. A representative subset of 18 cookies could be derived from the obtained clusters. The representativity was evaluated with statistical uni- and multivariate analyses. Results showed a broad variety of chocolate chips cookies with a large nutritional, compositional, water content, and sensory differences. These results highlighted the first paths for future reformulation in this product category and showed the importance to include physical product information beyond the information on the packaging. This complete database on the selected cookies constituted a solid base for identifying future reformulation levers, in order to improve the nutritional quality and health.",

Infants remember the items they have attended to and perceived, and their emotional state will influence their perception and representation of the events they encounter. Moreover, by examining the development of the whole cognitive system, or the whole child, we gain a deeper understanding of mechanisms developmental change. Thus, the big question for the study of infant cognition is like the question confronting all the king's horses and all the king's men: How do we put the infant's cognitive system back together again?",

BACKGROUND: Surgical patch angioplasty, transcatheter stent therapy and intraoperative stent delivery are valuable treatment options for PA stenoses. The experience with intraoperative hybrid therapy has increased and new techniques and equipment have become available. METHODS: This study involves a retrospective review of 20 patients with a median age of 5.1 years who underwent hybrid PA stent therapy between March 2003 and April 2008. Thirteen patients had underlying diagnoses of either tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or truncus arteriosus. RESULTS: In 15 procedures, stents were implanted under direct vision. In 3 procedures, stents were implanted using vascular puncture with angiographic guidance, and in 2 procedures, stents were implanted using a combination of direct vision and fluoroscopy/angiography. Successful stent deployment was achieved in 18/20 (90%) procedures. One stent was malpositioned from the right ventricular outflow tract through a VSD, while another stent fractured as a result of high-pressure balloon expansion of a very resistant lesion. Adverse events were encountered in 3/20 (15%) procedures, which included the 2 \"unsuccessful\" stent deliveries. The median follow up thus far has been 1.7 years (41 days to 5.1 years). Seven of 20 (35%) patients required repeated interventions at the site of previous stent placement at a median interval of 8.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid stent delivery in the operating room, using either direct vision or vascular puncture, is safe and effective. Using a well-equipped hybrid operating suite facilitates safe intraoperative stent delivery in a wide variety of patients. Close cooperation between the surgical and interventional teams is essential.",

Patients vary in awareness of their depressive symptoms and ability to bring depression-related concerns to medical attention. OBJECTIVE: To inform interventions to improve recognition and management of depression in primary care by understanding patients' inner experiences prior to and during the process of seeking treatment. DESIGN: Focus groups, analyzed qualitatively. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixteen adults (79% response) with personal or vicarious history of depression in Rochester NY, Austin TX and Sacramento CA. Neighborhood recruitment strategies achieved sociodemographic diversity. APPROACH: Open-ended questions developed by a multidisciplinary team and refined in three pilot focus groups explored participants' \"lived experiences\" of depression, depression-related beliefs, influences of significant others, and facilitators and barriers to care-seeking. Then, 12 focus groups stratified by gender and income were conducted, audio-recorded, and analyzed qualitatively using coding/editing methods. MAIN RESULTS: Participants described three stages leading to engaging in care for depression - \"knowing\" (recognizing that something was wrong), \"naming\" (finding words to describe their distress) and \"explaining\" (seeking meaningful attributions). \"Knowing\" is influenced by patient personality and social attitudes. \"Naming\" is affected by incongruity between the personal experience of depression and its narrow clinical conceptualizations, colloquial use of the word depression, and stigma. \"Explaining\" is influenced by the media, socialization processes and social relations. Physical/medical explanations can appear to facilitate care-seeking, but may also have detrimental consequences. Other explanations (characterological, situational) are common, and can serve to either enhance or reduce blame of oneself or others. CONCLUSIONS: To improve recognition of depression, primary care physicians should be alert to patients' ill-defined distress and heterogeneous symptoms, help patients name their distress, and promote explanations that comport with patients' lived experience, reduce blame and stigma, and facilitate care-seeking.",

We queried three sources of information: teacher educators, methods course syllabi, and national/state accreditation standards for teacher preparation. Findings revealed several key themes, including challenges inherent in guiding preservice teachers as they navigate homework policies. In addition, even though teacher educators believed it important to prepare preservice teachers for the inherent complexity of homework practices, they provided minimal guidance on how they might address such concerns. Syllabus and standards reviews showed that neither addressed homework-related issues. We discuss implications for preservice teacher preparation.",

      "abstract": "The dementia care literature in the home is vast, particularly in the health sciences where the focus remains on intervention to address carer emotional distress and burden. The sociological literature on dementia care has primarily utilized the illness disruption and (bio)medicalization models to show how meaning and practices are negotiated in the non-expert setting. Instead, I apply a feminist labor process perspective to examine the question of why women dementia kin carers resist relinquishing care responsibilities to others. This qualitative grounded theory study is based on seven waves of interviews (total = 98) conducted over approximately five years with 15 Latina dementia kin carers recruited through clinic and community sites in Northern California. Findings show how Latina kin carers exercise a degree of control and autonomy over the care process because they have developed tacit knowledge and skills to craft quality care of kin. In facing the dilemma of ceding care to others they perceive as unprepared, they reject available help. This study reveals how carers maintain quality care with dignity and comfort for the care recipient and themselves.",

However, HF mhealth lacks evidence of efficacy, caregiver involvement, and clinically useful real-time data. OBJECTIVE: We aim to capture health care providers' perceived value of HF mHealth, particularly for pairing patient-caregiver-generated data with clinical intervention to inform the design of future HF mHealth. METHODS: This study is a subanalysis of a larger qualitative study based on interviewing patients with HF, their caregivers, and health care providers. This analysis included interviews with health care providers (N=20), focusing on their perceived usefulness of HF mHealth tools and interventions. RESULTS: A total of 5 themes emerged: (1) bio-psychosocial-spiritual monitoring, (2) use of sensors, (3) interoperability, (4) data sharing, and (5) usefulness of patient-reported outcomes in practice. Providers remain interested in mHealth technologies for HF patients and their caregivers. However, providers report being unconvinced of the clinical usefulness of robust real-time patient-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of assessments, sensors, and real-time data collection could provide value in patient care. Future research must continually explore how to maximize the utility of mHealth for HF patients, their caregivers, and health care providers.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: HIV and cardiometabolic disorders including hypertension and diabetes pose a serious double threat in Malawi. Supportive couple relationships may be an important resource for managing these conditions. According to the theory of communal coping, couples will more effectively manage illness if they view the illness as \"our problem\" (shared illness appraisal) and are united in shared behavioral efforts. METHODS: This study qualitatively investigated communal coping of 25 couples living with HIV and hypertension or diabetes in Zomba, Malawi. Partners were interviewed separately regarding relationship quality, shared illness appraisal, communal coping, and dyadic management of illness. RESULTS: Most participants (80%) were living with HIV, and more than half were also living with hypertension. Most participants expressed high levels of unity and the view that illness was \"our problem.\" In some couples, partners expected but did not extend help and support and reported little collaboration. Communal coping and dyadic management were strongly gendered. Some women reported a one-sided support relationship in which they gave but did not receive support. Women were also more likely to initiate support interactions and offered more varied support than men. In couples with poor relationship quality and weak communal coping, dyadic management of illness was also weak. Partner support was particularly crucial for dietary changes, as women typically prepared meals for the entire family. Other lifestyle changes that could be supported or hindered by a partner included exercise, stress reduction, and medication adherence. CONCLUSION: We conclude that gendered power imbalances may influence the extent to which couple-level ideals translate into actual communal coping and health behaviors. Given that spouses and families of patients are also at risk due to shared environments, we call for a shift from an illness management paradigm to a paradigm of optimizing health for spouses and families regardless of diabetes or hypertension diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), there is growing evidence that racial/ethnic minority patients do not use portals as frequently as non-Hispanic whites to access their EHR information online. This differential portal use could be problematic for health care disparities since early evidence links portal use to better outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand specific barriers to portal use among African American and Latino patients at Kaiser Permanente, which has had a portal in place for over a decade, and broad uptake among the patient population at large. METHODS: We conducted 10 focus groups with 87 participants in 2012 and 2013 among African American and Latino Kaiser Permanente members in the mid-Atlantic, Georgia, and Southern California regions. Members were eligible to participate if they were not registered for portal access. Focus groups were conducted within each racial/ethnic group, and each included individuals who were older, had a chronic disease, or were parents (as these are the three biggest users of the portal at Kaiser Permanente overall). We videotaped each focus group and transcribed the discussion for analysis. We used general inductive coding to develop themes for major barriers to portal use, overall and separately by racial/ethnic group. RESULTS: We found that lack of support was a key barrier to initiating portal use in our sample-both in terms of technical assistance as well as the fear of the portal eroding existing personal relationships with health care providers. This held true across a range of focus groups representing a mix of age, income, health conditions, and geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study was among the first qualitative explorations of barriers to portal use among racial/ethnic subgroups. Our findings suggest that uniform adoption of portal use across diverse patient groups requires more usable and personalized websites, which may be particularly important for reducing health care disparities. This work is particularly important as all health care systems continue to offer and promote more health care features online via portals.",

But local lawmakers who understand that California needs to accommodate a lot more housing are stuck in a political bind. Wherever they might put new housing, neighborhood groups spring up and oppose it. The same groups will have money to spend or voters to turn out at the next election. What’s a well-meaning city councilperson to do? Our answer: California’s “housing element” process provides a way forward. California requires cities to periodically adopt a state-approved plan, called a housing element, which accommodates the city’s share of regional housing need. These plans are reviewed and certified for compliance by the state Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). Cities across the state will adopt new housing elements between 2020 and 2022, guiding development for the next eight years. This process hasn’t always worked well in the past, but the legislature and HCD have recently strengthened the framework. There are now substantial political advantages for city officials to pursue pro-housing policies through their housing element, rather than through the normal municipal lawmaking channels.",

Caregivers’ approaches for handling these behaviors have implications for both care partners’ well-being. Yet the specific strategies that caregivers use in their daily management of BPSD are relatively unknown. This study used in-depth focus group data to examine family caregivers’ strategies for managing BPSD. DESIGN:: As part of a larger study (NINR R01NR014200), four focus groups were conducted with a total of 26 family caregivers of older adults with dementia. Caregivers were asked to describe the strategies they use to manage BPSD. Data from audio-recorded sessions were transcribed, coded to identify relevant concepts, and reduced to determine major categories. RESULTS:: Caregivers managed BPSD through: 1) modifying interactions within the care dyad (e.g., simplifying communication); 2) modifying the care environment (e.g., using written prompts); 3) activity engagement; 4) humor; 5) self-care; and 6) social support. CONCLUSION:: Family caregivers manage BPSD using strategies to minimize stress and address the needs of both care partners. Caregivers’ own accounts of these approaches reveal a window into their everyday management of difficult behaviors. The present findings generate key information for routine clinical care and targeted interventions to promote caregiver well-being.",

Plausibility and recency affected only 9-year-olds' and adults' judgments. Study 2 demonstrated that younger versus older children and adults were less likely to reject false events, and that older children and adults were more likely to reject false events based on salience than were younger children. High-recency false events were more likely to be rejected than low-recency false events. Consistent with prediction, recency moderated the effect of salience.
