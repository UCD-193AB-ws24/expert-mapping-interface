  abstract: 'Twitter.com is a micro-blogging website. Although Twitter use is growing rapidly little is known about health behavior discussions on this site even though a majority of messages are publicly available. We retrieved publicly available Twitter messages during a 5-week period in early 2012 searching separately for the terms Pap smear and mammogram. We used content analysis to code each 140-character message generating a separate coding framework for each cancer screening term and calculating the frequencies of comments. Using the brief account description we also coded the author as individual organization or news media outlet. There were 203 Pap smear and 271 mammogram messages coded over three fourths of which were from individual accounts. Overall 22 of Pap smear messages and 25 of mammogram messages discussed personal experiences including attending appointments negative sentiment about the procedure and results. Other messages from both individuals and organizations 8 Pap smear 18 mammogram promoted screening. About one quarter of the messages expressed personal experiences with cancer screening. This demonstrates that Twitter can be a rich source of information and could be used to design new health-related interventions.',

  abstract: 'In 2016 California passed Senate Bill SB 1383 to reduce short-lived climate pollutants including methane gas. Towards this end the law specifically mandates a 75 reduction of organic waste including food waste FW from landfills by 2025. However current infrastructural capacity to treat this diverted organic waste is limited throughout the state so new facilities will need to be built to treat these valuable waste flows. The purpose of this study is to investigate ideal size and scale of new facilities that maximize FW treatment and minimize GHG emissions. To do so this study uses a case study of Los Angeles County to model a decentralized network of small-scale containerized anerobic digestors ADs for treatment of FW in the region. A spatial FW dataset developed for this study is used with a novel iterative-descent clustering model to simulate potential FW-sheds of ADs using Geographic Information Systems GIS. Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate a range of model results and a GHG analysis of FW collection is used to compare systems of two different AD capacities. The results of this analysis show that food waste is ideal for recycling at relatively small spatial scales as hauling burden of FW is reduced in these systems. The proposed infrastructure modeling approach is a first step of developing a zero net energy infrastructural solution that promotes a circular economy of food in direct response to SB 1383 and more broadly global climate change.',

  abstract: 'Twitter.com is a micro-blogging website. Although Twitter use is growing rapidly little is known about health behavior discussions on this site even though a majority of messages are publicly available. We retrieved publicly available Twitter messages during a 5-week period in early 2012 searching separately for the terms Pap smear and mammogram. We used content analysis to code each 140-character message generating a separate coding framework for each cancer screening term and calculating the frequencies of comments. Using the brief account description we also coded the author as individual organization or news media outlet. There were 203 Pap smear and 271 mammogram messages coded over three fourths of which were from individual accounts. Overall 22 of Pap smear messages and 25 of mammogram messages discussed personal experiences including attending appointments negative sentiment about the procedure and results. Other messages from both individuals and organizations 8 Pap smear 18 mammogram promoted screening. About one quarter of the messages expressed personal experiences with cancer screening. This demonstrates that Twitter can be a rich source of information and could be used to design new health-related interventions.',

  abstract: 'In 2016 California passed Senate Bill SB 1383 to reduce short-lived climate pollutants including methane gas. Towards this end the law specifically mandates a 75 reduction of organic waste including food waste FW from landfills by 2025. However current infrastructural capacity to treat this diverted organic waste is limited throughout the state so new facilities will need to be built to treat these valuable waste flows. The purpose of this study is to investigate ideal size and scale of new facilities that maximize FW treatment and minimize GHG emissions. To do so this study uses a case study of Los Angeles County to model a decentralized network of small-scale containerized anerobic digestors ADs for treatment of FW in the region. A spatial FW dataset developed for this study is used with a novel iterative-descent clustering model to simulate potential FW-sheds of ADs using Geographic Information Systems GIS. Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate a range of model results and a GHG analysis of FW collection is used to compare systems of two different AD capacities. The results of this analysis show that food waste is ideal for recycling at relatively small spatial scales as hauling burden of FW is reduced in these systems. The proposed infrastructure modeling approach is a first step of developing a zero net energy infrastructural solution that promotes a circular economy of food in direct response to SB 1383 and more broadly global climate change.',
