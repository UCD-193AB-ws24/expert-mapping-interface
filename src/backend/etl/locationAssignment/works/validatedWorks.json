        "abstract": "Background: The Arab Region accounts for most of the world's refugees. Despite being dispersed across the globe, most of these refugees are internally displaced within the region. A growing body of research argues that Western biomedical frameworks for conceptualizing, diagnosing, and treating trauma may not be suitable for non-Western and trauma caused by political violence inflicted on entire populations over time. The cultural and socio/political contexts of trauma are increasingly recognized as key to understanding trauma-related distress. Arab trauma research has emerged in the past 30 years. Nevertheless, the results are not systematically consolidated. Aim: This review aims to identify and map knowledge production in the Arab Region that is challenging Western notions of trauma experienced by Arab refugees in the region and attempts to explore the contours of a more culturally congruent conceptualization of trauma. Method: Following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR), we conducted a scoping review. Peer-reviewed, empirical literature from 1990 to 2023 was searched in eight English and three Arabic databases. Results and implications: Out of 2654 articles only ten were included. Included publications explored two main areas: conceptualization of trauma in Arab samples and addressing the subject of traumatization. The articles highlighted the limitations of using the PTSD model to diagnose and treat Arab refugees' traumatic stress and the importance of contextual, structural, and cultural factors in distress conceptualization. The articles provide research, clinical, and policy implications addressing adoption of social justice frameworks, development of contextually relevant trauma models, clinical investigations and assessment of symptoms and idioms.",

        "issued": "2020-11",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An aging United States population profoundly impacts healthcare from both a medical and financial standpoint, especially with an increase in related procedures such as Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program and Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Program incentivize hospitals to decrease post-operative readmissions by correlating reimbursements with smoother care transitions, thereby decreasing hospital burden and improving quantifiable patient outcomes. Many studies have proposed predictive models built upon risk factors for predicting 30-day THA readmissions. QUESTIONS: (1) Are there validated statistical models that predict 30-day readmissions for THA patients when appraised with a standards-based, reliable assessment tool?. (2) Which evidence-based factors are significant and have support across models for predicting risk of 30-day readmissions post-THA? METHODS: Five major electronic databases were searched to identify studies that examined correlations between post-THA readmission and risk factors using multivariate models. We rigorously applied the PRISMA methodology and TRIPOD criteria for assessment of the prognostic studies. RESULTS: We found 26 studies that offered predictive models, of which two presented models tested with validation cohorts. In addition to the many factors grouped into demographic, administrative, and clinical categories, bleeding disorder, higher ASA status, discharge disposition, and functional status appeared to have broad and significant support across the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of recent predictive models establishing risk factors for 30-day THA readmissions against the current standard could be improved. Aside from building better performing models, more work is needed to follow the thorough process of undergoing calibration, external validation, and integration with existing EHR systems for pursuing their use in clinical settings. There are several risk factors that are significant in multiple models; these factors should be closely examined clinically and leveraged in future risk modeling efforts.",
