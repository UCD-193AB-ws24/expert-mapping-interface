    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism is common and usually managed as an outpatient. A better understanding of patients at risk for an emergency department (ED) visit can improve health-care utilization and patient care. METHODS: The California Cancer Registry and Health Care Access and Information Databases were linked to identify patients who underwent a thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer 2005-2018 and had an ED visit for hypoparathyroidism within 2 y of surgery. Cumulative incidence and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with an ED visit. RESULTS: Among 41,502 thyroidectomy patients, 588 (1.42%) presented to the ED for hypoparathyroidism, with a median time between thyroidectomy and first ED visit of 4 ds. Two-year cumulative incidence was highest for women (1.56%), Hispanic patients (2.04%), younger adults aged 18-40 y (1.97%), higher Charlson comorbidity index score (2.43%), lowest neighborhood socioeconomic status quintile (1.97%), patients with >4 lymph nodes removed (2.04%), and patients not seen at an American College of Surgeons Committee on Cancer site (1.60%). Multivariable analysis revealed several factors associated with an increased risk of hypoparathyroidism, including female gender (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-2.10), Hispanic ethnicity (HR 1.41, 95% CI = 1.16-1.71), a higher Charlson comorbidity index score (≥2 = HR 1.91 [95% CI = 1.46-2.51]), and patients with >4 lymph nodesremoved (HR 1.70 [95% CI = 1.43-2.01]). CONCLUSIONS: ED visits for postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism are uncommon, but usually occurs shortly after surgery. Most risk factors identified are not modifiable, but they help identify high-risk patients who could benefit from targeted postoperative care (programs) to reduce unplanned ED visits.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adrenal hemorrhage (AH) can occur due to multiple etiologies with variable radiographic appearance, often indistinguishable from underlying adrenal neoplasms. There is a lack of AH literature and evidence-based guidelines. Our study aimed to understand the prevalence and etiology of AH, follow-up, and incidence of underlying neoplasm. METHODS: An institutional database was queried from January 2006 to October 2021 for patients with AH on imaging, excluding patients with known malignancies, adrenal masses, or prior adrenal surgery. Demographics, medical history, hematoma size, laterality, biochemical evaluation, intervention, and additional imaging were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 490,301 imaging reports queried, 530 (0.11%) with AH met inclusion criteria. Most imaging (n = 485, 91.5%) was performed during trauma evaluation. Two patients underwent dedicated intervention at presentation. Interval imaging was performed in 114 (21.5%) patients at a median of 2.6 (interquartile range 0.99-13.4) mo, with resolution (n = 84, 73.7%) or decreased size of AH (n = 21, 18.4%) in most patients. Only 10 patients (1.9%) saw an outpatient provider in our system to address AH or evaluate for underlying mass, and 9 (1.7%) underwent biochemical screening. Thirteen patients (11% of 118 patients with any follow-up) had evidence of an adrenal mass, confirmed on serial imaging (n = 10) or adrenalectomy (n = 3). Scans performed for nontrauma indications were significantly more likely to have an underlying mass (n = 6/26 [23.1%]) than those performed for trauma evaluation (n = 7/92 [7.6%], P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: AH is a rare finding associated with an increased rate of underlying adrenal mass, particularly when unrelated to trauma. Most AH resolves spontaneously without intervention. Follow-up imaging at 6 mo can help distinguish mass-associated AH from simple hemorrhage.",

    "issued": "2024-01",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association between surgical volume and patient outcome is well established, with higher case volume associated with a lower risk of complications. We hypothesized that the geographic distribution of endocrine/head and neck surgeons with an endocrine focus in the United States and Puerto Rico may limit access to many potential patients, particularly in rural areas. METHODS: We used web-based directories from the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, American Head and Neck Society, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery to identify endocrine surgery specialists in the United States and Puerto Rico. Using geographic coordinates and OpenStreetMap and Valhalla software, we calculated the areas within a 60-, 90-, or 120-minute driving distance from specialist offices. We used 2020 U.S. Census Data to calculate census tract populations inside or outside the accessible areas. RESULTS: Excluding duplicate providers across organizations, we geocoded 603 specialist addresses in the United States and Puerto. We found that 23.76% (78.3 million) of Americans do not have access to a society-affiliated endocrine/head and neck surgeon with an endocrine focus within a 60-minute drive, 14.37% (47.4 million) within a 90-minute drive, and 8.38% (27.6 million) within a 120-minute drive. We observed that the areas of coverage are primarily focused on metropolitan areas. CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third of Americans do not have access to a society-affiliated endocrine/head and neck surgeon with an endocrine focus within a 1-hour drive, highlighting a concerning geographic barrier to care. Further work is needed to facilitate patient access and mitigate disparities in quality care.",

    "abstract": "The radiologic diagnosis of adrenal disease can be challenging in settings of atypical presentations, mimics of benign and malignant adrenal masses, and rare adrenal anomalies. Misdiagnosis may lead to suboptimal management and adverse outcomes. Adrenal adenoma is the most common benign adrenal tumor that arises from the cortex, whereas adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant tumor of the cortex. Adrenal cyst and myelolipoma are other benign adrenal lesions and are characterized by their fluid and fat content, respectively. Pheochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal medulla. Metastases to the adrenal glands are the most common malignant adrenal tumors. While many of these masses have classic imaging appearances, considerable overlap exists between benign and malignant lesions and can pose a diagnostic challenge. Atypical adrenal adenomas include those that are lipid poor; contain macroscopic fat, hemorrhage, and/or iron; are heterogeneous and/or large; and demonstrate growth. Heterogeneous adrenal adenomas may mimic ACC, metastasis, or pheochromocytoma, particularly when they are 4 cm or larger, whereas smaller versions of ACC, metastasis, and pheochromocytoma and those with washout greater than 60% may mimic adenoma. Because of its nonenhanced CT attenuation of less than or equal to 10 HU, a lipid-rich adrenal adenoma may be mimicked by a benign adrenal cyst, or it may be mimicked by a tumor with central cystic and/or necrotic change such as ACC, pheochromocytoma, or metastasis. Rare adrenal tumors such as hemangioma, ganglioneuroma, and oncocytoma also may mimic adrenal adenoma, ACC, metastasis, and pheochromocytoma. The authors describe cases of adrenal neoplasms that they have encountered in clinical practice and presented to adrenal multidisciplinary tumor boards. Key lessons to aid in diagnosis and further guide appropriate management are provided. © RSNA, 2023 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "In absence of a \"gold standard\", a standardized clinical adjudication process was developed for a registrational trial of a transcriptomic host response (HR) test. Two physicians independently reviewed clinical data to adjudicate presence and source of bacterial and viral infections in emergency department patients. Discordant cases were resolved by a third physician. Agreement among 955 cases was 74.1% (708/955) for bacterial, 75.6% (722/955) for viral infections, and 71.2% (680/955) overall. Most discordances were minor (85.2%; 409/480) versus moderate (11.7%; 56/480) or complete (3.3%; 16/480). Concordance levels were lowest for bacterial skin and soft tissue infections (8.2%) and for viral respiratory tract infections (4.5%). This robust adjudication process can be used to evaluate HR tests and other diagnostics by regulatory agencies and for educating clinicians, laboratorians, and clinical researchers. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04094818. SUMMARY: Without a gold standard for evaluating host response tests, clinical adjudication is a robust reference standard that is essential to determine the true infection status in diagnostic registrational clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "The WHO aims to detect 90% of global cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) by 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionate burden of HBV and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we sought to assess the utility of a combined HBV and HCC screening program in Tanzania. We conducted a prospective, serial cross-sectional study of patients who participated in a combined HBV and HCC screening program at a regional referral hospital emergency department (ED) in Arusha, Tanzania, between April 19, 2022 and June 3, 2022. All patients completed a study questionnaire and were tested for HBV surface antigen. Patients who were HBV positive were screened for HCC via point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). The primary outcome was the number of new HBV diagnoses. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. A total of 846 patients were tested for HBV (primary ED: 761, clinic referral: 85). The median age of patients was 44 ± 15 years, and 66% were female. Only 15% of patients reported having a primary care doctor. Thirteen percent of patients had been previously vaccinated for HBV. There were 17 new HBV diagnoses (primary ED: 16, clinic referral: 1), which corresponds to a seroprevalence of 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2%, 3.2%). No patients had liver masses detected on POCUS. An ED-based, combined HBV and HCC screening protocol can be feasibly implemented. This study could serve as a model for HBV/HCC screening in regions with high HBV endemicity and low rates of community screening.",

    "issued": "2024-01-09",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus (CA-Sa) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are historically associated with densely populated urban areas experiencing high poverty rates, intravenous drug use, and homelessness. However, the epidemiology of CA-Sa SSTIs in the United States has been poorly understood since the plateau of the Community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemic in 2010. This study examines the spatial variation of CA-Sa SSTIs in a large, geographically heterogeneous population and identifies neighborhood characteristics associated with increased infection risk. METHODS: Using a unique neighborhood boundary, California Medical Service Study Areas, a hotspot analysis, and estimates of neighborhood infection risk ratios were conducted for all CA-Sa SSTIs presented in non-Federal California emergency departments between 2016 and 2019. A Bayesian Poisson regression model evaluated the association between neighborhood-level infection risk and population structure, neighborhood poverty rates, and being a healthcare shortage area. RESULTS: Emergency departments in more rural and mountainous parts of California experienced a higher burden of CA-Sa SSTIs between 2016 and 2019. Neighborhoods with high infection rates were more likely to have a high percentage of adults living below the federal poverty level and be a designated healthcare shortage area. Measures of population structure were not associated with infection risk in California neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight a potential change in the epidemiology of CA-Sa SSTIs in California emergency departments. Future studies should investigate the CA-Sa burden in other geographies to identify whether this shift in epidemiology holds across other states and populations. Further, a more thorough evaluation of potential mechanisms for the clustering of infections seen across California neighborhoods is needed.",

We conducted mobile HBV-HCC screening clinics in rural Tanzania between March 2021 and February 2023. After undergoing informed consent, patients completed a questionnaire about HBV. A rapid point-of-care (POC) assay measured HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and HBsAg-positive patients underwent POC ultrasound to screen for HCC and POC hepatitis C (HCV) antibody testing. The primary outcome was number of HBV diagnoses, and the secondary outcome was prevalence of liver masses in HBsAg-positive individuals. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Five hundred and one patients were screened for HBV; 63% (n = 303) were female with median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 40 (28-55) years. Only 6% (n = 30) reported being vaccinated against HBV, 92% (n = 453) reported no vaccination, and 2% (n = 12) did not know their vaccination status. Seventy-six percent (n = 340) did not know they should get vaccinated, and 4% (n = 16) reported that vaccination was too expensive. Two percent (n = 11) of patients were positive for HBsAg, with 55% (n = 6) of those being female with median (IQR) age of 36 (34-43) years. None of the HBsAg-positive patients reported being vaccinated against HBV, and all were negative for HCV. On ultrasound, one patient had a liver mass, and another had ascites. We demonstrated that community-based HBV and HCC screening can be implemented in Africa with local partnerships, and this model could be used to promote awareness and improve early detection of disease.",

    "abstract": "SCOPE: This European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to support a selection of appropriate antibiotic use practices for patients seen in the emergency department (ED) and guidance for their implementation. The topics addressed in this guideline are (a) Do biomarkers or rapid pathogen tests improve antibiotic prescribing and/or clinical outcomes? (b) Does taking blood cultures in common infectious syndromes improve antibiotic prescribing and/or clinical outcomes? (c) Does watchful waiting without antibacterial therapy or with delayed antibiotic prescribing reduce antibiotic prescribing without worsening clinical outcomes in patients with specific infectious syndromes? (d) Do structured culture follow-up programs in patients discharged from the ED with cultures pending improve antibiotic prescribing? METHODS: An expert panel was convened by European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and the guideline chair. The panel selected in consensus the four most relevant antimicrobial stewardship topics according to pre-defined relevance criteria. For each main question for the four topics, a systematic review was performed, including randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Both clinical outcomes and stewardship process outcomes related to antibiotic use were deemed relevant. The literature searches were conducted between May 2021 and March 2022. In April 2022, the panel members were formally asked to suggest additional studies that were not identified in the initial searches. Data were summarized in a meta-analysis if possible or otherwise summarized narratively. The certainty of the evidence was classified according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. The guideline panel reviewed the evidence per topic critically appraising the evidence and formulated recommendations through a consensus-based process. The strength of the recommendations was classified as strong or weak. To substantiate the implementation process, implementation trials or observational studies describing facilitators/barriers for implementation were identified from the same searches and were summarized narratively. RECOMMENDATIONS: The recommendations on the use of biomarkers and rapid pathogen diagnostic tests focus on the initiation of antibiotics in patients admitted through the ED. Their effect on the discontinuation or de-escalation of antibiotics during hospital stay was not reported, neither was their effect on hospital infection prevention and control practices. The recommendations on watchful waiting (i.e. withholding antibiotics with some form of follow-up) focus on specific infectious syndromes for which the primary care literature was also included. The recommendations on blood cultures focus on the indication in three common infectious syndromes in the ED explicitly excluding patients with sepsis or septic shock. Most recommendations are based on very low and low certainty of evidence, leading to weak recommendations or, when no evidence was available, to best practice statements. Implementation of these recommendations needs to be adapted to the specific settings and circumstances of the ED. The scarcity of high-quality studies in the area of antimicrobial stewardship in the ED highlights the need for future research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Ocean acidification may shift coral reefs from a state of net ecosystem calcification (+NEC) to net ecosystem dissolution (–NEC). Changes in NEC are typically inferred from either measured or calculated total alkalinity (TA) or the dissolved calcium (Ca) to salinity ratio relative to a reference value. The alkalinity anomaly technique has historically been the primary method to estimate NEC due to the greater analytical challenges and uncertainty associated with dissolved Ca measurements in seawater. However, this method assumes that changes in salinity-normalized TA are exclusively the result of calcification and dissolution processes. In many cases, this assumption is valid, but in some environments additional processes can significantly influence seawater TA (e.g., nutrient fluxes and redox processes). Seawater Ca is unaffected or less sensitive to these processes, and therefore, Ca and TA anomalies can be used to estimate absolute or relative changes in NEC with greater confidence. Here, we present a two-year time series of monthly seawater Ca and TA measurements across the Bermuda carbonate platform and the nearby Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) location offshore. High precision Ca measurements (±6 μmol kg−1) were conducted using an improved spectrophotometric titration system and showed mostly good agreement with changes in TA over the same spatial and temporal scales. Ca and TA measurements across the Bermuda platform showed seasonal fluctuations relative to offshore waters, with +NEC during summer months and near-zero or possible –NEC (net dissolution) during winter months. These seasonal patterns were most pronounced at the inshore locations with the longest residence times (10+ days), which allow stronger biogeochemical signals to develop relative to the offshore source water. Although obtaining high accuracy and precision Ca measurements remains challenging, parallel measurements of Ca and TA from both inshore and offshore waters over a multi-annual timescale could strengthen the validity of predictions for when and where a reef system, such as the Bermuda platform, may shift from +NEC to –NEC.",

    "issued": "2021",
    "abstract": "Salinity normalization of total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) data is commonly used to account for conservative mixing processes when inferring net metabolic modification of seawater by coral reefs. Salinity (S), TA, and DIC can be accurately and precisely measured, but salinity normalization of TA (nTA) and DIC (nDIC) can generate considerable and unrecognized uncertainties in coral reef metabolic rate estimates. While salinity normalization errors apply to nTA, nDIC, and other ions of interest in coral reefs, here, we focus on nTA due to its application as a proxy for net coral reef calcification and the importance for reefs to maintain calcium carbonate production under environmental change. We used global datasets of coral reef TA, S, and modeled groundwater discharge to assess the effect of different volumetric ratios of multiple freshwater TA inputs (i.e., groundwater, river, surface runoff, and precipitation) on nTA. Coral reef freshwater endmember TA ranged from -2 up to 3032 μmol/kg in hypothetical reef locations with freshwater inputs dominated by riverine, surface runoff, or precipitation mixing with groundwater. The upper bound of freshwater TA in these scenarios can result in an uncertainty in reef TA of up to 90 μmol/kg per unit S normalization if the freshwater endmember is erroneously assumed to have 0 μmol/kg alkalinity. The uncertainty associated with S normalization can, under some circumstances, even shift the interpretation of whether reefs are net calcifying to net dissolving, or vice versa. Moreover, the choice of reference salinity for normalization implicitly makes assumptions about whether biogeochemical processes occur before or after mixing between different water masses, which can add uncertainties of ±1.4% nTA per unit S normalization. Additional considerations in identifying potential freshwater sources of TA and their relative volumetric impact on seawater are required to reduce uncertainties associated with S normalization of coral reef carbonate chemistry data in some environments. However, at a minimum, researchers should minimize the range of salinities over which the normalization is applied, precisely measure salinity, and normalize TA values to a carefully selected reference salinity that takes local factors into account.",

    "issued": "2021-05",
    "abstract": "Global and local anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, acidification, overfishing, and pollution are expected to shift the benthic community composition of coral reefs from dominance by calcifying organisms to dominance by non-calcifying algae. These changes could reduce the ability of coral reef ecosystems to maintain positive net calcium carbonate accretion. However, relationships between community composition and calcification rates remain unclear. We performed field experiments to quantify the metabolic rates of the two most dominant coral reef substrate types, live coral and dead coral substrate colonized by a mixed algal assemblage, using a novel underwater respirometer. Our results revealed that calcification rates in the daytime were similar for the live coral and dead coral substrate communities. However, in the dark, while live corals continued to calcify at slower rates, the dead coral substrate communities exhibited carbonate dissolution. Daytime net photosynthesis of the dead coral substrate communities was up to five times as much as for live corals, which we hypothesize may have created favorable conditions for the precipitation of carbonate minerals. We conclude that: (1) calcification from dead coral substrate communities can contribute to coral reef community calcification during the day, and (2) dead coral substrate communities can also contribute to carbonate mineral dissolution at night, decreasing ecosystem calcification over a diel cycle. This provides evidence that reefs could shift from slow, long-term accretion of calcium carbonate to a state where large daily cycling of calcium carbonate occurs, but with little or no long-term accumulation of the carbonate minerals needed to sustain the reef against erosional forces.",

    "abstract": "Seagrass systems are integral components of both local and global carbon cycles and can substantially modify seawater biogeochemistry, which has ecological ramifications. However, the influence of seagrass on porewater biogeochemistry has not been fully described, and the exact role of this marine macrophyte and associated microbial communities in the modification of porewater chemistry remains equivocal. In the present study, carbonate chemistry in the water column and porewater was investigated over diel timescales in contrasting, tidally influenced seagrass systems in Southern California and Bermuda, including vegetated (Zostera marina) and unvegetated biomes (0–16 cm) in Mission Bay, San Diego, USA and a vegetated system (Thallasia testudinium) in Mangrove Bay, Ferry Reach, Bermuda. In Mission Bay, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) exhibited strong increasing gradients with sediment depth. Vertical porewater profiles differed between the sites, with almost twice as high concentrations of DIC and TA observed in the vegetated compared to the unvegetated sediments. In Mangrove Bay, both the range and vertical profiles of porewater carbonate parameters such as DIC and TA were much lower and, in contrast to Mission Bay where no distinct temporal signal was observed, biogeochemical parameters followed the semi-diurnal tidal signal in the water column. The observed differences between the study sites most likely reflect a differential influence of biological (biomass, detritus and infauna) and physical processes (e.g., sediment permeability, residence time and mixing) on porewater carbonate chemistry in the different settings.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The fields of anesthesiology and pain medicine are experiencing significant changes driven by market forces and professional preferences. While demand for anesthesiologists is rising, pain medicine is facing a decline in fellowship applications. METHODS: This study analyzed data from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) from 2019 to 2023, focusing on trends in fellowship applications to pain medicine programs. Additionally, preliminary data from the 2024 match cycle were examined. RESULTS: There has been a notable decrease in anesthesiology residents applying to pain medicine fellowships, with applications dropping from 351 in 2019 to 193 in 2023. The overall decline in anesthesia-based applicants to pain medicine fellowships was 45%, signaling the highest detriment among anesthesiology applicants compared to other specialties. Gender disparities have been prevalent, with the absolute number of female applicants decreasing every year since 2019. Additionally, the 2023 match saw a significant number of unfilled programs, with 35 out of 115 programs failing to fill all positions. Preliminary data from the 2024 match cycle suggest this downward trend is continuing. CONCLUSION: The decline in pain medicine fellowship applications, particularly among anesthesiology residents, signals potential future workforce shortages and challenges in patient care. Recruitment strategies should include early exposure to pain medicine during residency, enhanced mentorship programs, and robust recruitment efforts (including virtual options). Addressing these issues is essential to ensure enough trained specialists to meet the growing need for pain specialists nationally.",

    "abstract": "Infections related to neuromodulation devices such as spinal cord stimulators (SCS) and intrathecal pumps (ITPs) present complex challenges due to potential complications such as localized infections, deep infections, sepsis, and neurological injury. Prompt diagnosis requires patients and providers to be educated on wound management and sepsis symptoms for immediate medical attention. Antibiotic therapy and duration vary based on infection severity, with deep infections often requiring device removal despite recent improvements in salvage rates with aggressive initial intervention. Deep infections necessitate timely diagnosis through imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), followed by device removal and culture-guided antibiotic therapy, often in collaboration with infectious disease specialists and spine surgeons. ITP infections pose similar challenges along with the risk of meningitis and may require careful management of medication withdrawal symptoms during emergent pump removal. Lab monitoring may aid treatment assessment, although negative cultures can occur due to post-antibiotic exposure. Postoperative recommendations stress standardized guidelines, patient education, and vigilant surveillance, with close follow-up crucial for early infection detection and intervention. Managing device-related infections demands a multi-specialty approach to minimize complications and optimize outcomes. This paper outlines best practices for diagnosing, managing, and treating neuromodulation device infections, focusing on guiding clinical decision-making from the onset of infection through treatment and potential reimplantation.",

    "abstract": "International donors emphasize greater recipient-country ownership in the delivery of foreign assistance because it ostensibly promotes the efficient use of resources and strengthens recipient-country administrative capacity. The preferences of citizens in developing countries, however, are not well understood on this matter. Do they prefer that their own governments control foreign aid resources, or are there conditions under which they instead prefer that donors maintain control over how aid is implemented? We explore these questions through parallel survey experiments in Myanmar, Nepal, and Indonesia. Our experimental vignettes include two informational treatments: one about who implements aid (i.e., the donor or the recipient government) and the other about the trustworthiness of the foreign donor. The trust-in-donor treatment, on average, increases levels of support for aid in all three countries. In contrast, we observe heterogenous average treatment effects regarding aid control: control of aid by the donor rather than the government reduces levels of support in Indonesia and Myanmar, whereas it increases support levels in Nepal. We show how the cross-country variation in ATEs originates in consistent individual-level variation in reactions to aid control that is more shaped by respondents’ trust in their own government than their trust in the donor.",

    "issued": "2023-09",
    "abstract": "To influence states’ treatment of their citizens, various foreign actors deploy a broad array of tools, including moral suasion and material assistance. The efficacy of international pressure is often contingent on how publics in target states respond. Employing survey experiments, we examine how two common tools of external influence employed by other countries —verbal condemnation and the threat of aid withdrawal—affect public opinion in three Asian states that have been criticized for their human rights practices: Myanmar, Nepal, and Indonesia. Overall, we find that, in the face of such pressure, preference for the status quo policy becomes stronger among the supporters of incumbent governments in target states. In contrast, those who are not government partisans are more likely to support policy change for better human rights conditions. The latter, however, is the constituency less likely to exert influence on the government to revise its policy. Together, these findings point to the possibility that criticism and aid sanction threats employed by foreign countries will be ineffective or even counterproductive at least in the short run.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that ideology, material interests, and moral values drive citizens’ preferences over foreign aid policy. Little attention has been paid to how perceptions of the international environment affect these preferences. We examine the extent to which citizens in a traditional donor country consider donor competition when deciding whether to impose aid sanctions on governments engaged in human rights violations. Employing an information experiment conducted among Japanese adults, we find that the prospect of another donor ready to act as a substitute aid-provider reduces support for the use of aid sanctions. This effect runs most strongly through a pathway privileging security concerns, and the effect is larger among respondents who have preexisting concerns about the other donor. These results highlight the way in which public desires for foreign aid to bring about material returns can hinder a government’s ability to use aid to promote good governance ends.",

    "abstract": "In January 2018, soon after he was elected President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte signed a comprehensive tax reform bill. In this paper, a nationwide survey and embedded experiment are used to investigate how ordinary Filipino citizens responded to different possible changes in tax incidence originating in the reform. The survey was conducted a few days prior to the enactment of the legislation. Our survey experiment yielded two noteworthy findings. First, Filipino citizens' interest in gathering information about the government budget and its usage increased when they were explicitly reminded of the possibility that the reform would change their tax burden; importantly, this occurred whether they expected their taxes to increase or decrease. Second, lower class citizens were more motivated than upper class citizens to monitor government when faced with the prospect of major tax burden changes. These findings not only shed light on how ordinary citizens in the Philippines reacted to the impending historic tax reform, but also reveal limits of the conventional fiscal contract conception of the link between taxation and accountability.",

    "issued": "2025-12",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Pediatric cervical spine injury (PCSI) can result in devastating neurologic disability. While computed tomography (CT) imaging is both sensitive and specific in detecting clinically significant injuries, indiscriminate utilization can lead to excessive ionizing radiation exposure. A routine institutional audit revealed CTs were inappropriately obtained 54% of the time. This study evaluates the effects of an updated protocol to reduce radiation exposure in pediatric trauma patients. METHODS: Data were retrospectively analyzed from a pediatric level 1 trauma center from 2021 to 2022. The data were divided into two cohorts, pre-implementation (2021) and post-implementation (2022). Inclusion criteria were patients 0-14 years old with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ranging 9-15. Outside-hospital transfers were excluded. The primary study endpoints were guideline compliance and CT utilization. RESULTS: A total of 82 subjects were enrolled in this study. In 2021, there were 38 subjects (female/male 15/23, mean age 5.9 years old) with an average GCS of 13.6. In 2022, there were 44 subjects (female/male 19/25, mean age 5.2 years old) with an average GCS of 14.0. In 2021, the overall protocol adherence rate was 81.6%, and post-implementation in 2022, compliance was 93.2% (p = 0.109). Following implementation, the rate of inappropriate (protocol non-adherent CT) use decreased from 58.6 to 6.8% (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a new evidence-based institutional protocol for PCSI was associated with improved adherence and reduction of unnecessary CT orders. Ongoing monitoring will help determine if these improvements are sustained.",

    "issued": "2025-01-01",
    "abstract": "Children with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and intracranial injury (ICI) often receive unnecessary imaging and hospital admission, leading to avoidable burdens on patients and health systems. While most of these patients do not develop critical neurological injuries, identifying those at risk would allow for a more optimal determination of the appropriate level of initial emergency care. The Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) were developed as a triage tool to identify adult patients with mTBI and ICI who can benefit from repeat imaging, hospital admission, or neurosurgical consultation. Here, we sought to validate BIG in children at a Level I trauma center and determine if the BIG algorithm can accurately identify which patients with mTBI/ICI have critical neurosurgical injuries. We hypothesize that the BIG can identify critical neurological injuries more accurately than the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) alone and that more severe injury according to BIG is associated with worse patient outcome. We retrospectively reviewed TBI admissions at a single center (2017-2023) using an institutional registry. Patients included (0-17 years) had an initial head computerized tomography scan with ICI and a GCS of 14-15. Patients were retrospectively classified into the BIG categories (BIG 1, 2, or 3). Medical records were reviewed to identify clinically important TBI (ciTBI): death, neurological deterioration, neurosurgical intervention, intubation >24 h, or hospital admission >48 h due to TBI. Repeat imaging studies obtained were evaluated for progression of injury. The incidence of clinically important TBI (ciTBI) and imaging progression were recorded and compared across BIG categories. Outcomes were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOS-E) 6 months after injury. Univariable and chi-square tests were used to analyze comparisons. Overall, 804 subjects were included in the analysis of which 551 (68.5%) were transfers. Overall, 175 (21.8%) patients had a BIG 1, 402 (50.0%) a BIG 2, and 227 (28.2%) a BIG 3 injury. CiTBI occurred among 64 (8.0%) patients overall, and in 1 (0.6%), 4 (1.0%), and 59 (26.0%) of the BIG 1, 2, and 3 injuries (p < 0.0001). Progression on repeat imaging associated with neurological decline, neurosurgical intervention or resulting in additional evaluation was noted in 0 (0%), 2 (0.5%), and 41 (18.0%) of the BIG 1, 2, and 3 injuries (p < 0.001). Amongst 471 patients (58.6%) with available 6-month patient outcomes, 98% had a GOS-E ≥5 and no outcome difference between BIG categories was observed. Risk stratification of mild TBI using BIG allowed for reasonable identification of children who subsequently develop ciTBI, suggesting that BIG classification can aid in triage and management of patients who might benefit from neurosurgical consultation, repeat imaging, and potentially transfer to a dedicated trauma center. More severe injury according to BIG was not associated with a worse patient outcome.",

Tumor histologies included: Classic (n=8), Desmoplastic-Nodular (n=6), Anaplastic (n=1). Tumor genomic profiles were SHHP53WT(n=5), SHHP53 mutated (n=4), Group4 (n=3), NWNSHH (n=2), WNT (n=1). Gross total resection was achieved in 9 patients. Patients with post resection residual tumor, high risk genomic features or disseminated disease were stratified as high risk. We treated all radiation eligible patients (n=13) per COG ACNS0332 maintenance chemotherapy regardless of risk group with 12/13 receiving radiosensitization (Vincristine/Carboplatin) and either 23.4 Gy/36 Gy CSI (two patients treated per Headstart3D2 and ACNS0334 respectively). 2 patients with spinal cord disease were treated with intrathecal topotecan and liposomal cytarabine respectively. During ACNS0332 maintenance bacteremia, weight loss and hypomagnesemia were frequent complications. 5 patients required chemotherapy dose reductions (4 Vincristine/1 Cisplatin). Two patients with LFS developed glioblastoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma following ACNS0332 therapy. Two patients (with WNT and NWNSHH subgroup tumors) experienced medulloblastoma relapse. These patients were treated using LITT/Intrathecal chemotherapy and ACNS0821 chemotherapy. Both are alive and one patient is NED off therapy. All patients who have not developed secondary malignancies (n=13) are alive. (follow up 7-72 months). All attend school with support, 10 have hearing impairment and 5 receive endocrine supplements.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Utilizing patient specific risk adapted therapy we have achieved favorable clinical outcomes in our patient cohort.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hyperoxia has been suggested as a mechanism for secondary injury following adult traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its effects have not been well described in pediatric patients. METHODS: Pediatric (≤18yo) TBI patients were identified in a prospective institutional registry from October 2008 to April 2022. The first, highest, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) PaO2 in the first 24 hours were collected and calculated for each patient from arterial blood gas reports after admission to the ICU. Neurological outcome after 6 months was measured using dichotomized modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOS-E). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine if the three measurements for hyperoxia predicted an unfavorable outcome after controlling for well-established clinical and imaging predictors of outcome. RESULTS: We identified 98 pediatric patients with severe accidental TBI during the study period. Hyperoxia (PaO2 > 300 mmHg) occurred in 33% of the patients. The presence of elevated PaO2 values, determined by all three evaluations of hyperoxia, was not associated with unfavorable outcome after 6 months. CONCLUSION: Utilizing multiple methods to assess exposure, hyperoxia was present in a substantial number of patients with severe TBI but was not associated with an unfavorable outcome.",

    "abstract": "Craniosynostosis (CS) is a major birth defect resulting from premature fusion of cranial sutures. Nonsyndromic CS occurs more frequently than syndromic CS, with sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (sNCS) presenting as the most common CS phenotype. Previous genome-wide association and targeted sequencing analyses of sNCS have identified multiple associated loci, with the strongest association on chromosome 20. Herein, we report the first whole-genome sequencing study of sNCS using 63 proband-parent trios. Sequencing data for these trios were analyzed using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and rare variant TDT (rvTDT) to identify high-risk rare gene variants. Sequencing data were also examined for copy number variants (CNVs) and de novo variants. TDT analysis identified a highly significant locus at 20p12.3, localized to the intergenic region between BMP2 and the noncoding RNA gene LINC01428. Three variants (rs6054763, rs6054764, rs932517) were identified as potential causal variants due to their probability of being transcription factor binding sites, deleterious combined annotation dependent depletion scores, and high minor allele enrichment in probands. Morphometric analysis of cranial vault shape in an unaffected cohort validated the effect of these three single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on dolichocephaly. No genome-wide significant rare variants, de novo loci, or CNVs were identified. Future efforts to identify risk variants for sNCS should include sequencing of larger and more diverse population samples and increased omics analyses, such as RNA-seq and ATAC-seq.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fetal aqueductal stenosis (AS) affects approximately 1:1,000 pregnancies. Obstruction of cerebral spinal fluid circulation occurs at the aqueduct of Sylvius, leading to progressive hydrocephalus and macrocephaly, which often necessitates cesarean section (CS). The purpose of this study was to describe maternal outcomes associated with fetal AS. METHODS: This study is conducted through the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet). Subjects with a prenatal diagnosis of severe fetal central nervous system ventriculomegaly were recruited and followed longitudinally. Maternal events around the delivery of fetuses with AS were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven subjects with fetal AS confirmed by neonatal neuroimaging were analyzed. The average gestational age at delivery was 36.7 weeks. Overall, 86% were delivered by CS, and 62% of these were elective. Ninety-one percent of CSs were performed through a Pfannenstiel abdominal incision. A classical uterine incision was required in 13% of cesarean deliveries. The peripartum complication rate was 27%. CONCLUSION: Women carrying a fetus with AS were at risk for preterm birth, cesarean delivery, a classical uterine incision, and peripartum complications. These data highlight the maternal morbidity associated with fetal AS and the potential benefit of in utero therapy not only for neonatal outcomes but also for maternal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A critical component of an evidence-based reassessment of in-utero intervention for fetal aqueductal stenosis (fetal AS) is determining if the prenatal diagnosis can be accurately made at a gestational age amenable to in-utero intervention. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted through the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet). Pregnancies complicated by severe central nervous system (CNS) ventriculomegaly (lateral ventricle diameter &gt;15 mm) not secondary to a primary diagnosis (myelomeningocele, encephalocele, etc.) were recruited at diagnosis. Imaging and laboratory findings were recorded in an online REDCap database. After evaluation, investigators were asked to render their degree of confidence in the diagnosis of fetal AS. The prenatal diagnosis was compared to the postnatal diagnosis obtained through neonatal neuroimaging. Performance characteristics of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were calculated, as was the mean gestational age at diagnosis. RESULTS: Between April 2015 and October 2022, eleven NAFTNet centers contributed 64 subjects with severe fetal CNS ventriculomegaly. Of these, 56 had both prenatal and postnatal diagnoses recorded. Ultrasound revealed 32 fetal AS true positives, 4 false positives, 7 false negatives, and 13 true negatives, rendering a sensitivity of 0.82, a specificity of 0.76, a positive predictive value of 0.89, and a negative predictive value of 0.65. The mean gestational age at diagnosis by ultrasound was 25.5 weeks (std +/- 4.7 weeks). The proportion of agreement (true positive + true negative/n) was highest at 24 weeks gestation. For fetal MRI (n = 35), the sensitivity for fetal AS was 0.95, specificity was 0.69, positive predictive value was 0.84, and negative predictive value was 0.90. MRI was performed at 25 weeks on average. CONCLUSION: The prenatal diagnosis of fetal AS can be made with accuracy at a gestational age potentially amenable to in-utero intervention. Only 7% of subjects were incorrectly diagnosed prenatally with fetal AS by ultrasound and 11% by MRI. Diagnostic accuracy of fetal AS will likely improve with increased experience.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) and jejunoileal atresias are both rare (1 in 35,000–40,000 births and 1 in 5000 births, respectively). We present a case of a concomitant diagnosis of a cystic sacrococcygeal teratoma and a jejunoileal atresia. Case presentation: A twenty-week screening ultrasound identified a cystic pelvic mass (5.5 x 2.8 × 2.2 cm), dilated bowel, and mild polyhydramnios in an otherwise healthy G1P0 woman. Fetal magnetic resonance image showed a multiseptated presacral cystic mass suspicious for an internal sacrococcygeal teratoma and dilated bowel, thought to represent dilated ascending and transverse colon. Scheduled delivery at 39 weeks of gestation was uncomplicated. Postnatal ultrasound and MRI were consistent with prenatal findings. Given the rarity of both congenital anomalies and no known association between SCTs and jejunoileal atresia, the prenatal bowel dilation was thought to be due to partial obstruction secondary to the SCT. The baby thus underwent SCT resection on day-of-life 2. Ongoing obstruction after resection prompted a contrast enema which demonstrated a microcolon with reflux into the terminal ileum but no reflux into more dilated proximal loops concerning for intestinal atresia. On day-of-life 5, the baby underwent exploratory laparotomy which identified a type-2 ileal atresia, and a primary anastomosis was performed. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on day-of-life 22. Conclusion: Prenatal findings of dilated bowel should prompt providers to have a high index of suspicion for jejunoileal atresia, even if other diagnoses exist.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cloacal dysgenesis occurs from failure of embryological division of urogenital sinus and hindgut, leading to a single common perineal opening for genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. The prenatal diagnosis of cloacal malformation is imprecise, but the clinical correlation of postnatal findings to prenatal history can help reveal explanations for unusual pathological findings in patients with urogenital abnormalities. CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old woman was referred after her 20-week ultrasound demonstrated anhydramnios and concern for dilated fetal bowel. Fetal MRI confirmed anhydramnios and a dilated fetal colon, in addition to hydronephrosis and a pelvic cyst. Repeat ultrasound at 27 weeks showed unexpected complete resolution of her anhydramnios but new fetal ascites. The newborn girl was postnatally diagnosed with a cloacal malformation and an unusual near-complete fusion of her labia. She underwent proximal sigmoid colostomy and a tube vaginostomy at birth followed by cloacal reconstruction at 1.5 years old. CONCLUSION: In female fetus with a pelvic cyst, one should have a high index of suspicion for cloacal anomaly and consider the possibility of urinary obstruction leading to alteration in amniotic fluid.",

Direct fetal injury due to trauma during pregnancy is rare, and limited information is available about how to optimize fetal outcomes after injury.

We provide a detailed literature review of the management and outcomes of direct fetal injury following blunt and penetrating injury during pregnancy, and describe a suggested initial approach to the injured pregnant patient with a focus on evaluation for fetal injury. We identified 45 reported cases of blunt trauma resulting in direct fetal injury, with 21 surviving past the neonatal period, and 33 of penetrating trauma resulting in direct fetal injury, with 24 surviving past the neonatal period. Prenatal imaging identified fetal injury in 19 cases of blunt trauma and was used to identify bullet location relative to the fetus in 6 cases. These reports were used to develop management algorithms for the injured fetus.",

    "abstract": "Anthracnose, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, poses a significant and widespread threat to the common bean crop. The use of plant genetic resistance has proven to be the most effective strategy for managing anthracnose disease. The Amendoim Cavalo (AC) Andean cultivar has resistance against multiple races of C. lindemuthianum, which is conferred by the Co-AC gene. Fine mapping of this resistance gene to common bean chromosome Pv01 enabled the identification of Phvul.001G244300, Phvul.001G244400, and Phvul.001G244500 candidate genes for further validation. In this study, the relative expression of Co-AC candidate genes was assessed, as well as other putative genes in the vicinity of this locus and known resistance genes, in the AC cultivar following inoculation with the race 73 of C. lindemuthianum. Gene expression analysis revealed significantly higher expression levels of Phvul.001G244500. Notably, Phvul.001G244500 encodes a putative Basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of defense responses. Furthermore, a significant modulation of the expression of defense-related genes PR1a, PR1b, and PR2 was observed in a time-course experiment. These findings contribute to the development of improved strategies for breeding anthracnose-resistant common bean cultivars, thereby mitigating the impact of this pathogen on crop yields and ensuring sustainable bean production.",

    "abstract": "Despite its global importance as a primary source of table sugar and bioethanol, sugarcane faces a significant threat to its production due to diseases. One of these diseases, sugarcane smut, involves the emergence of a whip-like structure from the host apical shoot. The slow onset of this pathogenesis is the most substantial challenge for researchers to investigate the molecular events leading to resistance or susceptibility. In this study, we explored the early interaction between the smut fungus Sporisorium scitamineum and foliar tissues of the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Upon inoculation with the fungus, A. thaliana showed a compatible reaction, producing lesions during fungus colonization, whereas N. benthamiana showed signs of nonhost resistance. In addition, we propose a sugarcane detached leaf assay using plants cultivated in vitro to reveal sugarcane smut response outcomes. We used two sugarcane genotypes with known contrasting reactions to smut in the field. Although there is no evidence of sugarcane smut fungus infecting host leaves naturally, the sugarcane detached leaf assay enabled a rapid assessment of disease outcomes. Different symptoms in the detached leaves after inoculation distinguished smut-susceptible and smut-resistant sugarcane genotypes. Microscopic observations and gene expression analysis of S. scitamineum candidate effectors confirmed the fungal growth and its restriction on the compatible and incompatible interactions, respectively. These findings offer new prospects into the disease phenotyping of S. scitamineum, which could greatly expedite the comprehension of the initial stages of the pathogenesis and predict smut resistance in sugarcane genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Stomata serve as the battleground between plants and plant pathogens. Plants can perceive pathogens, inducing closure of the stomatal pore, while pathogens can overcome this immune response with their phytotoxins and elicitors. In this review, we summarize new discoveries in stomata-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have shown that stomatal movement continues to occur in a close-open-close-open pattern during bacterium infection, bringing a new understanding of stomatal immunity. Furthermore, the canonical pattern-triggered immunity pathway and ion channel activities seem to be common to plant-pathogen interactions outside of the well-studied Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas pathosystem. These developments can be useful to aid in the goal of crop improvement. New technologies to study intact leaves and advances in available omics data sets provide new methods for understanding the fight at the stomatal gate. Future studies should aim to further investigate the defense-growth trade-off in relation to stomatal immunity, as little is known at this time.",

    "abstract": "Multiple Salmonella enterica serovars and strains have been reported to be able to persist inside the foliar tissue of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), potentially resisting washing steps and reaching the consumer. Intraspecies variation of the bacterial pathogen and of the plant host can both significantly affect the outcome of foliar colonization. However, current understanding of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is still very limited. In this study, we evaluated the foliar fitness of 14 genetically barcoded S. enterica isolates from 10 different serovars, collected from plant and animal sources. The S. enterica isolates were vacuum-infiltrated individually or in pools into the leaves of three- to four-week-old lettuce plants. To estimate the survival capacity of individual isolates, we enumerated the bacterial populations at 0- and 10- days post-inoculation (DPI) and calculated their net growth. The competition of isolates in the lettuce apoplast was assessed through the determination of the relative abundance change of barcode counts of each isolate within pools during the 10 DPI experimental period. Isolates exhibiting varying apoplast fitness phenotypes were used to evaluate their capacity to grow in metabolites extracted from the lettuce apoplast and to elicit the reactive oxygen species burst immune response. Our study revealed that strains of S. enterica can substantially differ in their ability to survive and compete in a co-inhabited lettuce leaf apoplast. The differential foliar fitness observed among these S. enterica isolates might be explained, in part, by their ability to utilize nutrients available in the apoplast and to evade plant immune responses in this niche.",

    "issued": "2025-04",
    "abstract": "The SLICK1 allele of the prolactin receptor gene is associated with a short hair coat and thermotolerance in cattle. SLICK1 includes a single base pair deletion that creates a premature stop codon and prevents transcription of 120 AA in the cytoplasmic tail of the prolactin receptor (PRLR). It is unknown if the presence of the SLICK1 allele modifies Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling or the transcriptional response to prolactin. To investigate PRLR-associated signaling pathways in heterozygous SLICK1+/- Holsteins (slick), we performed immunohistochemistry on skin explants obtained from slick (n = 5) and nonslick (n = 6) heifers to evaluate phosphorylated (p)STAT1, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5 immunoreactivity (pSTAT1+, pSTAT3+, pSTAT5+) in hair follicles (HF) and sweat glands (SG). In slick skin, more HF lacked pSTAT3 immunoreactivity compared with nonslick skin. No difference was found for the proportion of pSTAT1+ or pSTAT5+ HF, nor the proportion of pSTAT1+ and pSTAT3+ SG between genotypes. Within immunoreactive HF and SG, there were no differences between genotypes in the proportion of pSTAT1+, pSTAT3+, or pSTAT5+ cells in HF, or pSTAT1+ and pSTAT3+ cells in SG. Next, we investigated pSTAT3 immunoreactivity and the transcriptome of slick and nonslick skin explants after exposure to a controlled level of prolactin in vitro. Skin explants from slick (n = 6) and nonslick (n = 6) heifers were cultured for 36 h in the presence of 50 ng/mL of recombinant ovine prolactin, bisected, and each half underwent immunohistochemistry for pSTAT3 or RNA sequencing. No difference was found between genotypes in the proportion of pSTAT3+ HF or SG, nor the proportion of pSTAT3+ cells within HF or SG. RNA was poly-A enriched and sequenced using Novaseq6000 (Illumina) and 221,342,181 reads were mapped to the bovine genome (bosTau 9). Using the DESeq package of R to determine differentially expressed genes (DEG), we found 87 upregulated and 79 downregulated transcripts in slick compared with nonslick skin. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified IL-17, leukocyte extravasation, and wound healing as upregulated signaling pathways, as well as activation of TNF, IL-1β, OSM, IFNγ, IL-17α, and IL-1R and inhibition of SHH and BMP4 upstream of the DEG. Analysis of genomic regions within ±2 kb of all DEG respective transcription start sites revealed enrichment of 3 binding sites for the OCT1 transcription factor in slick skin. In conclusion, our results suggest differences in local immune regulation, hair growth inhibition, and tissue remodeling in slick skin.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we established bovine embryonic stem cell (bESC) lines from early (eBL) and full (BL) blastocysts to determine the efficiency of bESC derivation from an earlier embryonic stage and compare the characteristics of the resulting lines. Using established medium and protocols for derivation of primed bESCs from expanded blastocysts, we derived bESC lines from eBLs and BLs with the same efficiency (4/12 each, 33%). Regardless of original blastocyst stage, bESC lines had a similar phenotype, including differentiation capacity, stable karyotype, and pluripotency marker expression over feeder-free transition and long-term culture. Transcriptome and functional analyses indicated that eBL- and BL-derived lines were in primed pluripotency. We additionally compared RNA-sequencing data from our lines to bovine embryos and stem cells from other recent reports, finding that base medium was the predominant source of variation among cell lines. In conclusion, our results show that indistinguishable bESC lines can be readily derived from eBL and BL, widening the pool of embryos available for bESC establishment. Finally, our investigation points to sources of variation in cell phenotype among recently reported bESC conditions, opening the door to future studies investigating the impact of factors aside from signaling molecules on ESC derivation, maintenance, and performance.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of in vitro gametogenesis (IVG) in the mouse opened up unforeseen possibilities for assisted reproduction. The development of this technology to be used in cattle production could accelerate the rate of genetic selection by dramatically reducing the generation interval, while decreasing the environmental impact of livestock production as the need to grow animals in the process of genetic selection would be reduced or even eliminated. Although several steps of the process of IVG such as in vitro oocyte maturation and fertilization, and embryo production are already routinely performed in cattle, other steps of the system such as in vitro follicle and oocyte development are still rudimentary. The stable derivation of bovine pluripotent stem cells is the starting point without which IVG cannot be realized. However, producing a primordial germ cell and taking this cell through oogenesis and folliculogenesis in a dish will require a more detailed understanding of the milestones that need to be accomplished in vivo before they can be recapitulated in vitro. In particular, understanding the regulatory circuitry of germ cell specification in the embryo, the timing and events related to development of the germ cell program, and the factors necessary to make a competent egg, will need to be uncovered. Here, we review the process of IVG and provide a brief description of the current advances and bottlenecks related to in vitro oogenesis and folliculogenesis in cattle. Finally, we provide a brief comparison between mice and cows in this regard.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ovarian tissue and follicle integrity before and after slow freezing or vitrification and postthawing in vitro culture. DESIGN: A laboratory study using bovine ovarian cortical tissue. SETTING: Academic laboratory. ANIMALS: Ovaries from healthy cattle. INTERVENTIONS: Bovine ovarian cortical tissue was subjected to either slow freezing or vitrification and subsequent in vitro culture. Tissue and follicle integrity were assessed before and after cryopreservation and culture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess follicle stages, morphology, and stromal cell density. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining was used to examine apoptosis, and Masson's trichrome staining was used to evaluate collagen content in the stromal environment. Immunofluorescent labeling was used to localize and quantify connexin 37 (CX37) and Ki67 expression. RESULTS: Regardless of previous cryopreservation, ovarian tissue culture resulted in a decreased percentage of primordial follicles and an increased percentage of primary follicles compared with fresh tissue, indicating that follicle activation was not negatively affected by cryopreservation. However, both culture and cryopreservation followed by culture decreased the percentage of normal preantral follicles compared with fresh tissue that had not been cultured. Culture and/or cryopreservation did not impact stromal cell number, but there was increased cell apoptosis in tissue that was cultured after vitrification compared with tissue that was not cultured. Tissue culture, regardless of cryopreservation, resulted in decreased collagen deposition. There were fewer follicles expressing CX37 in vitrified and thawed tissue compared with all other treatments. Cryopreservation and/or culture of ovarian tissue did not change the percentage of follicles that contained Ki67-positive granulosa cells or the percentage of Ki67-positive granulosa cells within those follicles. CONCLUSION: Based on these data, we conclude that tissue cryopreservation followed by culture does not affect follicle activation and growth, but it decreases the proportion of viable follicles within the tissue. Slow freezing was superior to vitrification as indicated by a higher proportion of follicles with normal morphology, lower stromal cell apoptosis, and maintenance of CX37 expression postthawing and after culture.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin elicits robust immune responses capable of disrupting normal ovarian function contributing to female infertility. However, effects of subclinical or non-detectable infections on oocyte competence and subsequent embryo development remain to be fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exposing bovine oocytes to low LPS doses on oocyte and embryo competence. Bovine oocytes were collected from slaughterhouse-derived ovaries and matured with vehicle-control or increasing doses of LPS (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg/mL) for 21 h. Oocytes (n = 252) were evaluated for nuclear maturation. A set of embryos from LPS-matured oocytes (n = 300) were cultured for 8 d to evaluate day 3 cleavage rates and day 8 blastocyst rates along with blastocyst cell counts. A subset of oocytes (n = 153) was fertilized and cultured for time-lapse image capture and analysis of embryo development. Results demonstrate no significant treatment differences among treatment groups in percent of oocytes at germinal vesicle (GV; P = 0.90), germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD; P = 0.13), meiosis I (MI; P = 0.26), or metaphase II (MII; P = 0.44). Likewise, treatment differences were not observed in cleavage rates (P = 0.97), or blastocyst rates (P = 0.88) evaluated via traditional microscopy. Treatment with LPS did not affect total blastocyst cell count (P = 0.68), as indicated by trophectoderm (P = 0.83), and inner cell mass (P = 0.21) cell counts. Time-lapse embryo evaluation demonstrated no differences among control or LPS matured oocytes in number of zygotes that did not cleave after fertilization (P = 0.84), or those that cleaved but arrested at the 2-cell stage (P = 0.50), 4-cell (P = 0.76), prior to morula (P = 0.76). However, embryos derived from oocytes challenged with 0.1 μg/mL LPS tended to have reduced development to the morula stage compared with vehicle-treated controls (P = 0.06). Additionally, the percentage of blastocysts derived from oocytes matured in 0.01 μg/mL LPS tended to decrease compared to vehicle-treated controls (11.38 and 25.45 %, respectively; P = 0.09). Similarly, the proportion of oocytes that developed to the blastocyst stage was greater in vehicle-treated controls (25.45 %) compared with embryos derived from oocytes matured in 0.1 and 1 μg/mL (5.92 and 6.55 %, respectively; P = 0.03) LPS. These data suggest LPS-matured oocytes that subsequently underwent in vitro fertilization, experienced decreased competence to develop to the blastocyst stage.",

Baseline characteristics: age 61.84 (± 8.32) years, BMI 27.40 (± 4.49) kg/m², 70.1% women. 4766 hips (25.3%) had WCEA≤25°. Within 4-8 years (mean 5.8 ±1.6) follow-up, 378 hips (2.0%) developed incident RHOA. We found an association between AD and RHOA (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.80 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-2.34). In secondary analyses, all other definitions of AD were also associated with incident RHOA (aOR ranging from 1.52 95% CI 1.19-1.94 to 1.96 95% CI 1.26-3.02). Descriptive statistics showed that the relative risk (RR) in AD hips to develop RHOA was higher compared to non-AD hips in age group 61-70 (RR 1.70), BMI<25 (RR 1.66), and in female hips (RR 1.73). CONCLUSION: AD was consistently associated with incident RHOA. Explorative analyses show that AD hips in women and age group 61-70 years seem to be more at risk of developing RHOA compared to non-AD hips.",

    "abstract": "In osteoarthritis (OA) research it is increasingly recognized that stratification according to disease phenotypes is essential for optimizing treatment regimens. Gender-specific differences in clinical OA manifestations have been identified, and this analysis aimed to assess whether these differences extend to imaging phenotypes.From the Osteoarthritis Initiative database 2523 participants (1409 women and 1114 men) with completed 3T MRI and whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging scores (WORMS) of the right knee at baseline were included. Imaging phenotypes were assigned based on modified Rapid OsteoArthritis MRI Eligibility Score: the inflammatory, meniscus-cartilage, and bone phenotype. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the effect of gender on phenotype, independent of BMI, race, Kellgren & Lawrence (KL) grade and level of physical activity. Female gender was independently associated with lower odds for the meniscus-cartilage (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.47-0.80, p < 0.001) but not for the inflammatory (OR 1.04, 95%CI 0.89-1.24, p = 0.697) or the subchondral bone phenotype (OR 1.13, 95%CI 0.95-1.36, p = 0.166). This difference highlights an opportunity for future refinements to better accommodate gender/sex differences in disease trajectories while investigating different treatment regimes in knee OA.",

This updated guideline proposes the nomenclature Bone Status Indices (BSI) as the comprehensive classification rather than bone turnover markers, bone markers, metabolic markers of bone turnover or metabolic markers of bone turnover, that are currently in use for the implicated molecules. On behalf of the IFCC Committee on Bone Metabolism and the Joint IOF Working Group and IFCC Committee on Bone Metabolism, the authors propose standardized nomenclature, abbreviations and measurement units for the bone status indices.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the use of non-invasive host and environmental samples for the detection and monitoring of equine respiratory pathogens has shown promise and a high overall agreement with the gold standard of nasal secretions. The present study looked at comparing nose wipes, stall sponges, and air samples with nasal swabs collected from 27 horses involved in an equine influenza (EI) outbreak. The outbreak involved 5 clinical, 6 subclinical, and 16 uninfected horses. Samples sets were collected at the onset of the index case and retested every 2-3 days thereafter until all horses tested qPCR-negative for EI virus (EIV). Nose wipes and stall sponges identified EIV in all clinical cases, and air samples identified EIV in 4/5 clinical horses. The overall agreement with all nasal swabs collected from clinical cases was 89% for nose wipes, 78% for stall sponges, and 44% for air samples. Due to the shorter shedding time in subclinical cases, nose wipes and stall sponges detected EIV in 5/6 and 4/6 subclinical horses, respectively. Only one single air sample tested qPCR-positive for EIV in a subclinical shedder. When compared to the gold standard of nasal secretions in subclinically infected horses, the overall agreement was 54% for stall sponges, 50% for air samples, and 45% for nose wipes. The collection of non-invasive contact and environmental samples is a promising alternative to nasal swabs for the detection of EIV in clinically and subclinically infected horses. However, they should always be considered as a second-choice sample type to the more accurate nasal swabs and used to test refractory horses or large populations during outbreaks. Further, the pooling of identical or different samples collected from the same horse for the qPCR testing of EIV increases the accuracy of detecting EIV, especially in subclinically infected horses.",

    "abstract": "Alprazolam is used to facilitate mare-foal bonding in aggressive or anxious postpartum mares. In humans, alprazolam crosses the blood-milk barrier, but the amount transferred into milk is minor and compatible with breastfeeding as the relative infant dose is < 10%. Similar data are not available for horses. The aim of this study was to measure alprazolam in serum and milk of mares (milk: serum ratio) administered alprazolam, and to determine alprazolam serum concentrations in nursing foals to estimate the extent of absorption. This was a prospective observational study involving 7 healthy postpartum mares and foals. Mares received alprazolam (0.04 mg/kg PO, q12h) for 6 days. Venous blood and milk samples were collected on days 3,4,5 and 6, just before the next dose, and were used to calculate milk: serum ratios and estimate the extent of absorption of alprazolam by foals. A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay was used to measure alprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. There were no significant differences in concentrations of alprazolam or α-hydroxyalprazolam in mare serum, milk, or foal serum over time, consistent with steady state and a lack of accumulation. Milk:serum ratios were similar to slightly higher than those reported in humans (median: 0.64; range: 0.42-3.0). Relative foal dose (RFD) based on 12 h concentrations was < 10% in all foals and in 96% of total samples. Foal serum concentrations of alprazolam were 6.6% ± 4.1% of those in mare serum at the same time points. This study shows that milk:serum ratios of alprazolam in mares are variable. Foal serum concentrations and RFD suggest that alprazolam is safe for use in mares with nursing foals.",

    "issued": "2025-03",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis has been defined in humans as the concurrent proven or suspected presence of microbial infection and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Sepsis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal foals. The clinical utility of using SIRS or its individual components to predict infection and mortality in critically ill foals is currently unknown. OBJECTIVES: Assess the ability of history and signalment, clinical findings, laboratory results, and SIRS-related indices to predict infection and mortality in critically ill foals. ANIMALS: Retrospective, multi-center, cross-sectional study using a convenience sample of 1068 critically ill foals < 3 days of age admitted to 16 veterinary referral hospitals in 4 countries. METHODS: Data were retrieved from medical records. Infection was defined as the presence of bacteremia (positive blood culture) or clinical identification of an infected focus on admission. Univariate non-parametric and categorical methods, multivariate logistic regression, and classification tree methods were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Foal age at admission and presence of toxic neutrophils were independent predictors of infection, whereas SIRS-related indices were not predictive of infection. In-hospital mortality was 24%. Independent predictors for mortality were hypokinetic pulses, cold extremities, presence of seizures, blood L-lactate concentration > 6.0 mmol/L, and increased serum potassium and total bilirubin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The presence of infection in critically ill newborn foals was not predicted by SIRS indices. Cardiovascular dysfunction was strongly associated with mortality, suggesting that maintaining adequate perfusion and pulse pressure should be important treatment goals.",

    "abstract": "Alloimmune disorders occur in foals when pregnant mares produce antibodies against antigens on the foal's cells or tissues, and concentrate them within colostrum. Once foals nurse and absorb colostral antibodies, they can develop hematologic or cutaneous manifestations that can occur individually or in combination. These include neonatal isoerythrolysis, a hemolytic anemia directed against factors on the foal's erythrocytes, alloimmune thrombocytopenia when the antibodies are directed against platelet antigens, alloimmune neutropenia when they are directed against neutrophil antigens, and a combination of suspected alloimmune ulcerative dermatitis, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Foals can also develop neutrophilic dermatitis which is suspected to be alloimmune.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematology is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate the health status of horses. However, breed differences are often not considered. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to compare complete blood count variables among Warmbloods, Thoroughbreds, and stock horses (SH). METHODS: Ninety-six healthy horses were grouped by breed (Warmbloods, Thoroughbreds, and SH). Samples were collected through venipuncture for complete blood count analysis. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's tests or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post hoc tests were used to compare hematologic variables among groups. RESULTS: Warmbloods had a significantly lower total white blood cell (WBC) count (6.08 ± 1.11 × 109/L) and lymphocyte count (1.76 ± 0.41 × 109/L) than Thoroughbreds (7.28 ± 1.45; 2.28 ± 5.16 × 109/L, respectively; P < .001) and SH (7.21 ± 1.18 × 109/L, P < .01; 2.10 ± 5.17 × 109/L; P < .05). Warmbloods had a significantly lower red blood cell count (7.7 ± 0.8 × 1012/L) and higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV, 49.4 ± 2.2 fL) than Thoroughbreds (8.42 ± 1.2 × 1012/L, P < .01; 47.3 ± 3.0 fL). Warmbloods had lower MCVs than SH (49.4 ± 2.2 vs 51.2 ± 2.6 fL). The mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was higher in Warmbloods (35.0, 33.8-36.2 g/dL) and Thoroughbreds (34.9, 33.4-35.7 g/dL) than in SH breeds (34.0, 33.4-35.4 g/dL; P < .001, both). Total protein concentrations were significantly lower in Thoroughbreds (67, 59-80 g/L) compared with SH (71, 64-83 g/dL) (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Warmbloods had decreased WBC and lymphocyte counts compared with Thoroughbreds and SH, and Thoroughbreds had increased red blood cell counts. Thoroughbreds had lower total protein concentrations than SH. Clinicians should consider breed differences when interpreting hematologic values.",

    "issued": "2025",
    "abstract": "Expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, particularly when containing the GluN2B subunit (NMDAR-GluN2B), varies across the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In humans, the subgenual cingulate cortex (SGC) contains among the highest levels of NMDAR-GluN2B expression, while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) exhibits a more moderate level of NMDAR-GluN2B expression. NMDAR-GluN2B are commonly associated with ionotropic synaptic function and plasticity and are essential to the neurotransmission underlying working memory in the macaque dlPFC in the layer III circuits, which in humans are afflicted in schizophrenia. However, NMDAR-GluN2B can also be found at extrasynaptic sites, where they may trigger distinct events, including some linked to neurodegenerative processes. The SGC is an early site of tau pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD), which mirrors its high NMDAR-GluN2B expression. Additionally, the SGC is hyperactive in depression, which can be treated with NMDAR antagonists. Given the clinical relevance of NMDAR in the SGC and dlPFC, the current study used immunoelectron microscopy (immunoEM) to quantitatively compare the synaptic and extrasynaptic expression patterns of NMDAR-GluN2B across excitatory and inhibitory neuron dendrites in rhesus macaque layer III SGC and dlPFC. We found a larger population of extrasynaptic NMDAR-GluN2B in dendrites of putative pyramidal neurons in SGC as compared to the dlPFC, while the dlPFC had a higher proportion of synaptic NMDAR-GluN2B. In contrast, in putative inhibitory dendrites from both areas, extrasynaptic expression of NMDAR-GluN2B was far more frequently observed over synaptic expression. These findings may provide insight into varying cortical vulnerability to alterations in excitability and neurodegenerative forces.",

    "issued": "2025-03",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies. METHOD: We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described Qß virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-Qß). RESULTS: Two vaccine doses of pT181-Qß, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-Qß against tauopathies. HIGHLIGHTS: Icosahedral display of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (pT181) Qß virus-like particle surface (\"pT181-Qß\" vaccine) induces a robust immune response in mice and in non-human primates (NHPs) pT181-Qß vaccination reduces pathological tau (pTau) and brain atrophy, and improves memory and motor function in PS19 and hTau mice. pT181-Qß vaccination-induced immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) are safe, Th2 skewed (anti-inflammatory), specific to pTau in human AD brain, and efficiently engage pT181 in NHPs and human brain lysate. pT181+ tau in human plasma correlates with the neurofilament light in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-suggesting the presence of pT181-Qß vaccine target in the early disease state.",

    "abstract": "CD4+ T cells survey and maintain immune homeostasis in the brain, yet their differentiation states and functional capabilities remain unclear. Our approach, combining single-cell transcriptomic analysis, ATAC-Seq, spatial transcriptomics, and flow cytometry, revealed a distinct subset of CCR7+ CD4+ T cells resembling lymph node central memory (TCM) cells. We observed chromatin accessibility at the CCR7, CD28, and BCL-6 loci, defining molecular features of TCM. Brain CCR7+ CD4+ T cells exhibited recall proliferation and interleukin-2 production ex vivo, showcasing their functional competence. We identified the skull bone marrow as a local niche for these cells alongside CNS border tissues. Sequestering TCM cells in lymph nodes using FTY720 led to reduced CCR7+ CD4+ T cell frequencies in the cerebrospinal fluid, accompanied by increased monocyte levels and soluble markers indicating immune activation. In macaques chronically infected with SIVCL757 and experiencing viral rebound due to cessation of antiretroviral therapy, a decrease in brain CCR7+ CD4+ T cells was observed, along with increased microglial activation and initiation of neurodegenerative pathways. Our findings highlight a role for CCR7+ CD4+ T cells in CNS immune surveillance, and their decline during chronic SIV highlights their responsiveness to neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Tumor lineage plasticity (LP) is an emerging hallmark of cancer progression. Through pharmacologically probing the function of epigenetic regulators in prostate cancer cells and organoids, we identified bromodomain protein BRD4 as a crucial player. Integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis of tumors revealed, for the first time, that BRD4 directly activates hundreds of genes in the LP programs which include neurogenesis, axonogenesis, EMT and stem cells and key drivers such as POU3F2 (BRN2), ASCL1/2, NeuroD1, SOX2/9, RUNX1/2 and DLL3. Interestingly, BRD4 genome occupancy is reprogrammed by anti-AR drugs from facilitating AR function in CRPC cells to activating the LP programs and is facilitated by pioneer factor FOXA1. Significantly, we demonstrated that BRD4 inhibitor AZD5153, currently at clinical development, possesses potent activities in complete blockade of tumor growth of both de novo neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and treatment-induced NEPC PDXs and that suppression of tumor expression of LP programs through reduction of local chromatin accessibility is the primary mechanism of action (MOA) by AZD5153. Together, our study revealed that BRD4 plays a fundamental role in direct activation of tumor LP programs and that its inhibitor AZD5153 is highly promising in effective treatment of the lethal forms of the diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies have transformed oncology by utilizing the immune system to target malignancies; however, limitations in efficacy and potential side effects remain significant challenges. Nanoparticles have shown promise in enhancing drug delivery and improving immune activation, with the potential for numerous modifications to tailor them for specific environments or targets. Integrating nanoplatforms offers a promising avenue to overcome these hurdles, enhancing treatment outcomes and reducing adverse effects. By improving drug delivery, targeting, and immune modulation, nanoplatforms can unlock the full potential of cancer immunotherapy. This review explores the role of nanoplatforms in addressing these limitations and enhancing cancer immunotherapy outcomes, examining various types of nanoplatforms. Understanding the mechanisms of immunomodulation through nanoplatform deliveries is crucial. We discuss how these nanoplatforms interact with the tumor microenvironment, modulate tumor-associated macrophages and regulatory T cells, activate immune cells directly, enhance antigen presentation, and promote immunological memory. Further benefits include combination approaches integrating nanoplatforms with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and phototherapy. Immunotherapy is a relatively new approach, but numerous clinical studies already utilize nanoplatform-based immunotherapies with promising results. This review aims to provide insights into the potential of nanoplatforms to enhance cancer immunotherapy and pave the way for more effective and personalized treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Rational design of multifunctional nanoplatforms capable of combining therapeutic effects with real-time monitoring of drug distribution and tumor status is emerging as a promising approach in cancer nanomedicine. Here, we introduce pyropheophorbide a-bisaminoquinoline conjugate lipid nanoparticles (PPBC LNPs) as a bimodal system for image-guided phototherapy in bladder cancer treatment. PPBC LNPs not only demonstrate both powerful photodynamic and photothermal effects upon light activation, but also exhibit potent autophagy blockage, effectively inducing bladder cancer cell death. Furthermore, PPBC LNPs possess remarkable photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) imaging capabilities, enabling imaging with high-resolution, deep tissue penetration and high sensitivity for tracking drug biodistribution and phototherapy efficacy. Specifically, PA imaging confirms the efficient accumulation of PPBC LNPs within tumor and predicts therapeutic outcomes of photodynamic therapy, while FL imaging confirms their prolonged retention at the tumor site for up to 6 days. PPBC LNPs significantly suppress bladder tumor growth, with several tumors completely ablated following just two doses of the nanoparticles and laser treatment. Additionally, PPBC LNPs were formulated with lipid-based excipients and assembled using microfluidic technology to enhance biocompatibility, stability, and scalability, showing potential for clinical translation. This versatile nanoparticle represents a promising candidate for further development in bladder cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a daunting global health problem with a steadily rising incidence. Despite the wide arsenal of current anticancer therapies, challenges such as drug resistance, tumor heterogeneity, poor targeting, and severe side effects often lead to suboptimal efficacy and poor patient outcomes, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. Autophagy modulation has emerged as an attractive approach to complement existing therapies. The dual role of autophagy in cancer promotion and suppression has inspired the development of new drugs and therapeutic strategies focusing on both inhibition and induction. Despite the promising results of current autophagy modulators in preclinical studies, challenges such as the lack of selectivity and potency, toxicity, poor pharmacokinetics, and inadequate tumor targeting continue to limit their successful clinical translation. Many of these challenges could be overcome using nanomedicine. This review explores recent advancements in nanomedicine strategies for autophagy modulation. Successful combination strategies leveraging nanoparticles and autophagy modulators in synergy with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, phototherapy, gene therapy, and other modalities are presented. Additionally, nanomaterials with intrinsic autophagy-modulating capabilities, such as self-assembling autophagy inhibitors, are discussed. Finally, limitations of autophagy modulators currently in clinical trials are discussed, and future perspectives on designing nanomedicine for successful clinical implementation are explored.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be caused by metabolic stressors such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), sensitizes the endothelium to pathological changes. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a master regulator of inflammation, previously shown to promote oxLDL-induced inflammatory pyroptosis in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). However, a presumed role for IRF-1 in regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in response to metabolic stress has not been demonstrated. Here targeted deletion of IRF-1 by siRNA in HAEC aggravated oxLDL-induced, mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis, as evidenced by increased Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 activation, and chromosomal DNA breakage. The increased apoptosis was concomitant with accumulation of mitochondrial ROS, decrease in intracellular ATP production and respiratory oxygen consumption, and abnormal mitochondrial structure. RNA profiling of endothelial cells isolated from wild type and Irf1 knockout mice, followed by quantitative PCR, luciferase activity assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), revealed that IRF-1 directly regulated the expression of transmembrane protein 70 (TMEM70), an ancillary factor required for the assembly of ATP synthase and conversion of an electrochemical gradient to ATP synthesis. Mirroring the effect of IRF1 knockdown, depletion of TMEM70 in HAEC resulted in impaired mitochondrial function and enhanced cell apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of TMEM70 rescued ATP biosynthesis and suppressed apoptosis in oxLDL-treated, IRF-1-deficient HAEC. These results reveal a novel homeostatic role for IRF-1 in the regulation of mitochondrial function and associated stress-induced apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Cell inflammation and death are closely linked processes contributing to endothelial dysfunction, which plays a critical role in atherogenesis. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes pyroptosis, the Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated inflammatory cell death. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway has been implicated in inflammation; however, its role in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated endothelial dysfunction has not been investigated. This study investigated a role for the non-canonical NF-κB pathway in regulating endothelial pyroptosis as it relates to atherogenesis. Immunohistochemistry indicated inflammasome activation in the endothelial cells (EC) of human atherosclerotic arteries. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis revealed that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, concomitant with the activation of non-canonical NF-κB in primary human aortic EC. Interference of NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK), the key regulator of the non-canonical pathway, significantly attenuated oxLDL- or LPS/ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, pyroptosis, IL-1β, and IL-18 secretion. In contrast, overexpression of NIK exacerbated these responses. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway upregulated the transcription factor IRF-1 through RelB/p52 binding to its promoter region at -782/-770. In addition to the known target CASP1, RNA sequencing further identified GSDMD as a target gene of IRF-1. IRF-1 but not RelB/p52 interacted with the GSDMD promoter at -526/-515 and the CASP1 promoter at -11/10 to promote the expression and CASP1-mediated activation of GSDMD. Consistent with the observations in cultured endothelium, endothelial-specific deficiency of NIK or IRF-1 attenuated atherosclerosis in high-fat diet-fed Apoe-null mice. These data demonstrate that the non-canonical NF-κB pathway contributes to NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated endothelial pyroptosis and the development of atherosclerosis through GSDMD activation in a manner dependent on IRF-1. Further investigation may facilitate the identification of specific therapeutic targets for atherosclerotic heart diseases.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) not only provide an abundant source of vascular cells for potential therapeutic applications in vascular disease but also constitute an excellent model for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the differentiation and the functionality of vascular cells. Here, we reported that myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) transcription factor, but not any other members of the MEF2 family, was robustly upregulated during the differentiation of vascular progenitors and endothelial cells (ECs) from hiPSCs. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) strongly induced MEF2C expression in endothelial lineage cells. The specific upregulation of MEF2C during the commitment of endothelial lineage was dependent on the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, knockdown of MEF2C with shRNA in hiPSCs did not affect the differentiation of ECs from these hiPSCs, but greatly reduced the migration and tube formation capacity of the hiPSC-derived ECs. Through a chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, genome-wide RNA-sequencing, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunostaining analyses of the hiPSC-derived endothelial lineage cells with MEF2C inhibition or knockdown compared to control hiPSC-derived ECs, we identified TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and transmembrane protein 100 (TMEM100) as novel targets of MEF2C. This study demonstrates an important role for MEF2C in regulating human EC functions and highlights MEF2C and its downstream effectors as potential targets to treat vascular malfunction-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Clinically used inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) negatively impacts endothelial-dependent vasodilatation (EDD) through unidentified mechanisms. Here we show that either the endothelium-specific deletion of Mtor to inhibit both mTOR complexes, or depletion of Raptor or Rictor to disrupt mTORC1 or mTORC2, causes impaired EDD, accompanied by reduced NO in the serum of mice. Consistently, inhibition of mTOR decreases NO production by human and mouse EC. Specifically, inhibition of mTORC1 suppresses eNOS gene expression, due to impairment in p70S6K-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of the transcription factor KLF2 expression. In contrast to mTORC1 inhibition, a positive-feedback between MAPK (p38 and JNK) activation and Nox2 upregulation contributes to the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes eNOS uncoupling and decreased NO bioavailability in mTORC2-inhibited EC. Adeno-associated virus-mediated EC-specific overexpression of KLF2 or suppression of Nox2 restores EDD function in endothelial mTORC1- or mTORC2-inhibited mice.",

    "abstract": "Increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 on the activated arterial endothelial cell (EC) surface critically contributes to atherosclerosis which may in part be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. This study investigated whether and how the clinically available histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) inhibitor drug Romidepsin epigenetically modulates VCAM-1 expression to suppress atherosclerosis. Methods: VCAM-1 expression was analyzed in primary human aortic EC (HAEC) treated with Romidepsin or transfected with HDAC1/2-targeting siRNA. Methylation of GATA6 promoter region was examined with methylation-specific PCR assay. Enrichment of STAT3 to GATA6 promoter was detected with chromatin immunoprecipitation. Lys685Arg mutation was constructed to block STAT3 acetylation. The potential therapeutic effect of Romidepsin on atherosclerosis was evaluated in Apoe-/- mice fed with a high-fat diet. Results: Romidepsin significantly attenuated TNFα-induced VCAM-1 expression on HAEC surface and monocyte adhesion through simultaneous inhibition of HDAC1/2. This downregulation of VCAM-1 was attributable to reduced expression of transcription factor GATA6. Romidepsin enhanced STAT3 acetylation and its binding to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), leading to hypermethylation of the GATA6 promoter CpG-rich region at +140/+255. Blocking STAT3 acetylation at Lys685 disrupted DNMT1-STAT3 interaction, decreased GATA6 promoter methylation, and reversed the suppressive effects of HDAC1/2 inhibition on GATA6 and VCAM-1 expression. Finally, intraperitoneal administration of Romidepsin reduced diet-induced atherosclerotic lesion development in Apoe-/- mice, accompanied by a reduction in GATA6/VCAM-1 expression in the aorta. Conclusions: HDAC1/2 contributes to VCAM-1 expression and atherosclerosis by suppressing STAT3 acetylation-dependent GATA6 promoter methylation. These findings may provide a rationale for HDAC1/2-targeting therapy in atherosclerotic heart disease.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we explore spectral heterogeneity within plant canopies, a characteristic often observed in stressed plants where certain leaves or intra-leaf regions exhibit stress symptoms while others remain unaffected. Considering this variability in spectral signatures holds promise for enhancing remote sensing methodologies aimed at plant stress detection. Typically, remote sensing techniques analyze the plant as a whole, potentially overlooking stress-related spectral signatures due to the inclusion of unaffected pixels. We used a clustering-based technique, which incorporates semi-supervised learning elements for tuning hyper-parameters, to differentiate spectral patterns associated with and unique to pixels from broomrape-infected (Orobanche spp. and Phelipanche spp.) carrots from unrelated patterns. Ground-based hyperspectral (400–1000 nm) images of broomrape-infected and non-infected carrot canopies were used in an agglomerative clustering procedure followed by spectral angle mapper (SAM) analysis to identify a spectral endmember indicative of broomrape infection symptoms. Pixels from this cluster constituted an average of 8.5–11.5 % from the canopies of infected plants. Subsequently, we: (a) examined the relationship between carrot leaf mineral content and the percentage of symptomatic pixels to explore stress-induced alterations creating the unique spectral signatures of infected plants; and (b) utilized the inverse mode of PROSPECT, a radiative transfer model (RTM), to derive primary plant traits from the distinct spectral data of each cluster. We found that deficits in two macro elements, phosphorous and potassium, along with two pigments, chlorophyll and carotenoid, were correlated with the symptomatic cluster in infected plants. The methodology presented in this study paves the way for further research into broomrape detection in various crop species, as well as other plant stressors.",

    "abstract": "Late-season weed emergence in California rice fields complicates decisions concerning the timing of control measures. The objective of this study was to predict the emergence of three problematic weed species in rice using thermal time models. Smallflower umbrella sedge, barnyardgrass, and bearded sprangletop seedlings were counted and removed daily at three locations across the Sacramento Valley rice-growing region in 2018. The accumulation of thermal time (growing degree days; GDD) commenced with the initial flooding of the fields at each location, utilizing the specific base temperatures corresponding to each species. The pattern of emergence as a function of GDD was modeled with a Weibull function. Root-mean-square values for comparing actual and model-predicted cumulative emergence values were 6% to 23%. Percent cumulative emergence initially increased rapidly for smallflower umbrella sedge and reached 90% emergence with accumulation of 13 GDD. Barnyardgrass emerged after smallflower umbrella sedge and reached 90% emergence with an accumulation of 124 GDD. Bearded sprangletop had a delay of 64 GDD compared to barnyardgrass to reach first emergence and reached 90% emergence at 215 GDD. The period of weed emergence at all field sites differed across the three species and led to a continuous spectrum of weed emergence over time. This study characterizes the emergence of three economically important rice weeds and provides useful information for the timing of weed management. Typical herbicide applications on the day of seeding may have less efficacy on the late-emerging weeds, causing reduced weed control. Delayed herbicide application, overlay of residual herbicides, or use of herbicides with longer residual activity are suggested to control late-emerging weeds.",

    "abstract": "The success of the insect sterile technique (IST) in managing insect pests raised the hypothesis that a similar approach could be employed to control weed populations. Here, we investigated the feasibility of employing irradiated sterile pollen as a means to disrupt seed production in dioecious weeds, specifically focusing on Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson). Our goal was to determine the optimal irradiation dose that strikes a balance between inducing sterility and preserving competitiveness, as excessive doses could result in pollen mortality, while low doses may retain fertility. Plants were grown in a greenhouse during the summer of 2020 and spring of 2021. Once they reached the flowering stage, male and female individuals were isolated. Mature pollen samples were collected and exposed to varying dosages (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 Gy) of gamma rays. These irradiated and non-irradiated pollen samples were used in pollen viability assessments and hand-pollination experiments. In the hand-pollination study conducted in 2020, we employed six pollination treatments using different irradiation doses. The results showed that 300 Gy was the most effective dose, resulting in a maximum reduction of 30% in seed set compared with open pollination when irradiated pollen had prior access to the stigma through artificial pollination before open pollination. In 2021, to simulate real field conditions, three additional treatments were introduced into the study, further confirming the effectiveness of the optimal 300 Gy dose. Our findings indicate that the sterile pollen technique (SPT) using irradiated pollen can be a valuable approach for reducing weed seed production. SPT also holds potential for broad-spectrum weed control by mixing sterile pollen from multiple weed species in a single application. Additionally, it could aid in managing herbicide-resistant weeds that have survived in-season control efforts. This research contributes to the development of novel and sustainable weed management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Successful alien species may experience a period of quiescence, known as the lag phase, before becoming invasive and widespread. The existence of lags introduces severe uncertainty in risk analyses of aliens as the present state of species is a poor predictor of future distributions, invasion success and impact. Predicting a species' ability to invade and pose negative impacts requires a quantitative understanding of the commonality and magnitude of lags, environmental factors and mechanisms likely to terminate lag. Using herbarium and climate data, we analysed over 5,700 time series (species × regions) in 3,505 naturalized plant species from nine regions in temperate and tropical climates to quantify lags and test whether there have been shifts in the species' climatic space during the transition from the lag phase to the expansion phase. Lags were identified in 35% of the assessed invasion events. We detected phylogenetic signals for lag phases in temperate climate regions and that annual self-fertilizing species were less likely to experience lags. Where lags existed, they had an average length of 40 years and a maximum of 320 years. Lengthy lags (>100 years) were more likely to occur in perennial plants and less frequent in self-pollinating species. For 98% of the species with a lag phase, the climate spaces sampled during the lag period differed from those in the expansion phase based on the assessment of centroid shifts or degree of climate space overlap. Our results highlight the importance of functional traits for the onset of the expansion phase and suggest that climate discovery may play a role in terminating the lag phase. However, other possibilities, such as sampling issues and climate niche shifts, cannot be ruled out.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the timing of weed emergence is crucial to effective management. Management practices implemented too early may fail to completely control late-emerging seedlings, whereas management practices implemented too late will suffer from low efficacy. Weed emergence times reflect biological factors, such as seed dormancy and germination requirements, as well as environmental conditions. We conducted a systematic review of studies that developed models to predict weed emergence temporal patterns. We screened 1,854 studies, 98 of which were included in the final dataset. Most of the studies included were conducted in North America (51%) or Europe (30%). A wide variety of weed species (102) and families (21) were included, and many studies modeled several weeds. Grass weeds (Poaceae) were modeled most frequently (83 instances). Most weeds (40%) had base temperature values between 0 and 5 C, and 38% had base water potential ranging from -1.0 to -0.5 MPa. Most studies used empirical parametric models, such as Weibull (40%) or Gompertz (30%) models. Nonparametric and mechanistic models were also represented. Models varied in their biological and environmental data requirements. In general, empirical parametric models based on hydrothermal time (i.e., time above base temperature and water potential thresholds) represented a good balance between ease of use and prediction accuracy. Soft computing approaches such as artificial neural networks demonstrated substantial potential in situations with complex emergence patterns and limited data availability, although they (soft computing approaches) can be susceptible to overfitting. Our study also demonstrated variability in model performance and limited generalizability across species and regions. This finding underscores the need for context-specific and well-validated weed emergence models to inform management, especially in the context of climate change.",

    "issued": "2025-03",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reporting of obesity-associated metabolic disease severity and longitudinal response to bariatric surgery is not standardized. We updated our co-morbidity scoring tool to the Assessment of Obesity-related Metabolic Conditions (AOMC) to combine pharmacotherapy and biochemical data to score diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and dyslipidemia (DYS) severity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine whether the AOMC system more accurately stages metabolic disease severity than a clinically based Assessment of Obesity-Related Comorbidities (AORC) system. SETTING: University hospital, United States. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected demographic, clinical, and biochemical data was performed on adults evaluated for bariatric surgery over 6years. AORC versus AOMC scores and disease severity were compared using McNemar's and Wilcoxon's tests. RESULTS: Of 1442 patients, AOMC newly diagnosed metabolic disease in more patients than did AORC: DM (73.4% versus 44.5%), HTN (91.7% versus 67.9%), and DYS (63.8% versus 53.4%). Of those on pharmacotherapy, AOMC found fewer patients with adequately controlled disease: DM (39.9% versus 97.7%), HTN (64.7% versus 99.3%), and DYS (51.8% versus 99.0%). For those in whom both scores could be calculated, disease severity was upstaged in most patients: DM (65.9%), HTN (42.9%), and DYS (30.9%). There were also significant shifts toward higher scores for all conditions and severity classifications, with more patients diagnosed with pre-metabolic and severe disease (untreated/uncontrolled). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the severity of DM, HTN, and DYS is vastly under-represented by clinical history alone and lacks standardized assessments. Our AOMC tool more accurately describes longitudinal metabolic response to bariatric surgery.",

    "abstract": "Since nearly 40% of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) patients are individuals with the ability to bear children, many may seek to become pregnant or may be currently lactating when seeking surgery. While many patients plan to breastfeed, MBS patients are at high risk for premature cessation of breastfeeding. Limited literature exists on the impact of MBS on lactation and there are no established guidelines to help clinicians support and educate MBS patients about breastfeeding. Herein, we aim to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive guide for bariatric surgeons, obstetricians, women's health providers, lactation consultants, registered dietitians, bariatric nurse coordinators, and advanced practice providers to support breastfeeding in patients with a history of MBS or who are considering MBS. We review physician-patient discussion points on how MBS impacts lactation, the micronutrient and caloric needs for this unique population, and data to support successful breastfeeding in post-MBS patients who are lactating regarding practical, anesthetic, and imaging considerations.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging of blood-brain barrier permeability has been instrumental in identifying its broad involvement in neurological and systemic diseases. However, current methods evaluate the blood-brain barrier mainly as a structural barrier. Here we developed a non-invasive positron emission tomography method in humans to measure the blood-brain barrier permeability of molecular radiotracers that cross the blood-brain barrier through its molecule-specific transport mechanism. Our method uses high-temporal resolution dynamic imaging and kinetic modeling for multiparametric imaging and quantification of the blood-brain barrier permeability-surface area product of molecular radiotracers. We show, in humans, our method can resolve blood-brain barrier permeability across three radiotracers and demonstrate its utility in studying brain aging and brain-body interactions in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver inflammation. Our method opens new directions to effectively study the molecular permeability of the human blood-brain barrier in vivo using the large catalogue of available molecular positron emission tomography tracers.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Underweight women and those with obesity, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) are known to have worse prognosis. Whether BMI impacts BC stage at diagnosis and BC specific survival (BCSS) is not understood. We aim to better understand the relationship between BMI with stage at BC diagnosis and BCSS. METHODS: Women age ≥ 15 years old diagnosed with BC between 2014 and 2019 were identified from the California Cancer Registry. BMI at diagnosis was classified as underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2), obesity class 1-2 (30-39.9 kg/m2), and obesity class 3 (≥ 40 kg/m2). BC late stage of diagnosis was defined as American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3 and 4. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to compare sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with late stage. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression models assessed association of BMI and BCSS. RESULTS: Of 159,248 patients: 2.2% were underweight, 34.6% normal weight, 30.5% overweight, 26.7% obesity class 1-2, and 6.0% obesity class 3. Compared to normal weight, patients who were underweight [Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.54, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.51-1.57], obesity class 1-2 [HR 1.06, 1.05-1.07], and obesity class 3 [HR 1.14, 1.12-1.16] were more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage BC. In models stratified by age, patients ≥ 40 years who were underweight had worse BCSS, while patients ≥ 51 years with obesity class 1-2 had better BCSS. CONCLUSION: Patients with obesity class 1-2 were more likely to be diagnosed with a later stage, but had improved BCSS, supporting an \"obesity paradox\" in BC and suggesting that other measures are needed to better assess body composition, adipose distribution, and metabolic health of patients. Patients who were underweight had worse survival, suggesting this high-risk group may benefit from being assessed and treated for possible sarcopenia and malnourishment.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive behavior in complex environments critically relies on the ability to appropriately link specific choices or actions to their outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms that support the ability to credit only those past choices believed to have caused the observed outcomes remain unclear. Here, we leverage multivariate pattern analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and an adaptive learning task to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms of such specific credit assignment. We find that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and hippocampus (HC) code for the causal choice identity when credit needs to be assigned for choices that are separated from outcomes by a long delay, even when this delayed transition is punctuated by interim decisions. Further, we show when interim decisions must be made, learning is additionally supported by lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC). Our results indicate that lFPC holds previous causal choices in a 'pending' state until a relevant outcome is observed, and the fidelity of these representations predicts the fidelity of subsequent causal choice representations in lOFC and HC during credit assignment. Together, these results highlight the importance of the timely reinstatement of specific causes in lOFC and HC in learning choice-outcome relationships when delays and choices intervene, a critical component of real-world learning and decision making.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive behavior in complex environments critically relies on the ability to appropriately link specific choices or actions to their outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms that support the ability to credit only those past choices believed to have caused the observed outcomes remain unclear. Here, we leverage multivariate pattern analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and an adaptive learning task to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms of such specific credit assignment. We find that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and hippocampus (HC) code for the causal choice identity when credit needs to be assigned for choices that are separated from outcomes by a long delay, even when this delayed transition is punctuated by interim decisions. Further, we show when interim decisions must be made, learning is additionally supported by lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC). Our results indicate that lFPC holds previous causal choices in a \"pending\" state until a relevant outcome is observed, and the fidelity of these representations predicts the fidelity of subsequent causal choice representations in lOFC and HC during credit assignment. Together, these results highlight the importance of the timely reinstatement of specific causes in lOFC and HC in learning choice-outcome relationships when delays and choices intervene, a critical component of real-world learning and decision making.",

    "abstract": "Alfred Hitchcock, film director and \"Master of Suspense,\" observed that terror is not driven by a negative event, but \"only in the anticipation of it.\" This observation is not restricted to the movies: Anxiety builds when we anticipate uncertain negative events, and heightened reactivity during uncertain threat anticipation is a transdiagnostic marker of anxiety (Grupe & Nitschke, 2013; Holley & Fox, 2022; Hur et al., 2020; Krain et al., 2008; Simmons et al., 2008; Yassa et al., 2012). Here, we manipulate the temporal dynamics of an uncertain threat to demonstrate how the evolving expectation of threat can lead people to forgo rewards and experience fear/anxiety. Specifically, we show that increased \"hazard rate,\" which can build during periods of uncertainty, promotes a tendency to avoid threatening contexts while increasing fear/anxiety. These results provide insight into why the anticipation of temporally uncertain threats elicits fear/anxiety, and reframe the underlying causes of related psychopathology.",

    "issued": "2025-01",
    "abstract": "Background: Byproducts of broccoli floret production, stems and leaves meal (BSLM), could be fed to older layers, likely increasing production and egg quality. However, BSLM contains glucosinolates, possibly unpalatable and harmful to layers at high concentrations. Results: A corn-soy control diet (n = 55) and an experimental diet (n = 55) containing 15 g kg−1 BSLM and 2.37 g kg−1 excess protein compared with the control were fed to non-molted 94- to 100-week-old layers, genetically bred for high livability and production. Significance was assessed at p ≤ 0.05. Egg production was lower (p < 0.01) for the control compared with the experimental diet. For weeks 4–6, the experimental diet produced a lower (p ≤ 0.05) ADFI and FCR compared with itself and the control at weeks 0–2. FCR was lower (p ≤ 0.05) for the experimental diet. ADFI, egg weight, Haugh unit, and shell beak force were statistically similar. Yolks from the experimental diet had greater xanthophyll content (p ≤ 0.001) and color (p ≤ 0.01) but not greater ascorbic acid. Zeaxanthin in eggs from the experimental diet was temporally reduced. Conclusions: Variations of N in BSLM or other byproducts collected over large acreage should be considered when formulating diets. A follow-up study across layer age and breeds should ascertain the effect of quantities of various dietary constituent (protein, BSLM, and fiber alone and in combinations) on production and carotenoids in eggs at 2-week intervals. Studies involving heating methods and consumption of BSLM eggs and subsequent uptake of xanthophylls and carotenes by humans may help determine the value of these eggs for human health. Assessment of physiological conditions for layers fed broccoli at 15.00 g kg−1 in the diet will ensure lack of harmful effects for younger and older layers.",

    "abstract": "The skeletal health of laying hens improves when birds are given opportunities to perform load-bearing movements with elevated structures, such as perches. We investigated how early access to elevated structures varying in complexity and height would affect bone quality and subsequent keel bone fractures in a layer multitiered aviary. Female Dekalb White pullets were reared in floor pens furnished with floor perches (FL), single-tiered aviaries (ST), or 2-tiered aviaries (TT; n = 5 pens/treatment) through 16 wk of age. At 17 wks, all structures were replaced with identical multitiered layer aviaries. The keel, both tibiae, and both humeri were collected from 60 euthanized birds from each rearing treatment at 8, 16 and 30 wk of age, and analyzed with dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for bone mineral density and length. At 18, 26, 28, and 30 wk of age, 10 focal hens/pen were radiographed repeatedly and the presence, severity of keel bone fractures were assessed with a tagged visual analogue scale. The number of fractures was also recorded. At 16 wk of age, FL pullets had lower BMD of the tibia (P = 0.003), keel (P = 0.013), and humerus (P = 0.004) compared to ST and TT pullets. Most of the observed treatment differences disappeared after pullets were transferred to the aviary. BMD continued to increase for all hens through 30 wk of age. Pullet rearing did not affect the presence or severity of keel bone fractures, or number of new fractures incurred between ages (P > 0.05). The prevalence and severity of keel bone fractures increased between 26 to 28 wk and remained high to 30 wk of age (P < 0.0001). Hens experienced more new fractures between 26 to 30 wk than between 18 to 26 wk of age (P = 0.0046). The effects of pullet housing on bone quality were short-term when hens had access to adult housing with multiple opportunities for load-bearing movements. Keel fractures with minor severity were high in prevalence reflecting the use of radiography to assess this injury.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The chicken body louse is an obligate ectoparasite of domestic chickens. Chicken body lice feed on feathers, and infestation with this louse is linked to decreases in egg production, hen weight, and feed conversion efficiency. However, it is unknown how chicken body lice impact egg-laying chickens in cage-free environments. Welfare and behavior metrics were collected from flocks of egg-laying chickens either infested with chicken body lice or left uninfested. METHODS: In two trials, two flocks of cage-free commercial egg-laying chickens were infested with chicken body lice or maintained as uninfested controls. At three timepoints, behavior and welfare of all chickens was measured. On-animal sensors were used to quantify pecking, preening, and dustbathing behavior. Other animal-based welfare metrics included recording comb wounds and skin lesions. RESULTS: Birds infested with chicken body lice exhibited significantly more preening behaviors than uninfested birds, even at low louse levels. Moderate or severe skin lesions were detected on birds that were moderately infested with chicken body lice while skin lesions were never detected on uninfested birds. CONCLUSIONS: The welfare of chickens was impacted by the chicken body louse, a chewing louse that primarily feather feeds. Evidence of skin lesions on infested birds suggests that lice may cause more damage to birds than previously thought, and further evaluation of louse economic damage is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Spatial abilities of hens are particularly sensitive to development during early life. Experiences in pullet housing may have lasting consequences on adult hens' movements in cage-free environments. We tested whether opportunities to access elevated spaces during rearing improved hens' use of a multitiered aviary. Female Dekalb White pullets were reared in either floor pens (FL), single-tiered aviaries (ST), or 2-tiered aviaries (TT; n = 5 pens/environment) through 16 wk of age. Rearing structures were replaced with identical multitiered aviaries at 17 wk. The distribution of the flock within the aviary and the vertical transitions of 10 focal hens/pen across the aviary were determined from videos recorded during their first (D1) and seventh (D7) day of aviary access, as well as at 19, 23, and 27 wk of age. Prevalence of floor eggs was recorded weekly from 17 to 28 wk of age. On D1, more ST and TT hens utilized the aviary during the daytime (P = 0.0077), made more vertical transitions when searching for a roosting spot in the evening (P = 0.0021), and maintained a consistent distance traveled during transitions compared to FL hens (P = 0.02). These differences disappeared by D7, except that ST and TT hens continued to roost on the highest perches of the aviary more (P < 0.0001) than FL hens through 27 wk of age. FL hens laid more floor eggs than ST and TT hens for the first 2 wk of lay (P < 0.0001). The majority (97.9%) of vertical transitions was controlled. Uncontrolled transitions were highest at D1 and decreased by D7 (P = 0.0009) and were not affected by rearing (P = 0.33). The results suggest that hens reared with minimal height are hesitant to use the laying hen aviaries when they are first transferred. They acclimate within 1 to 2 wk, but continue to roost less in the highest accessible level.",

    "abstract": "Multi-tiered aviary systems provide laying hens with opportunities for species-specific behaviors, including vertical and horizontal movement. However, collisions and failed landings that occur during vertical movement can be associated with injuries. Previous studies suggest that floor rearing of pullets with minimal access to elevated structures may negatively impact adult laying hens’ ability to navigate vertical space. However, it is not clear whether this is due to deficits in physical ability or differences in depth perception. This was investigated in pullets and egg-laying hens using a modified Y-maze task and a visual cliff task at 7–8, 15–16, and 29–30 weeks of age. Dekalb White pullets (N = 450) were reared in three different environments until 16 weeks of age: floor, single-tier aviary, and two-tier aviary. From 16 weeks of age, all birds were housed in a multi-tier aviary. The Y-maze task consisted of two arms that were either a ratio of 1:3 or 1:1 in length. Each bird's ability to discriminate the different arm lengths was evaluated based on latency to exit and arm choice. The illusion of depth over a plexiglass floor was tested in the visual cliff task at 15, 30, and 90 cm. Birds were given 1.5 min to either leave the start perch by jumping to a platform suspended over the visual cliff, or step down off the perch to the shallow side. Latency to jump to the platform and frequency of looking down over the visual cliff were recorded. There were no main effects of age or rearing treatment on behavior in the Y-maze, with all birds choosing the shorter arm more than chance (p < 0.001). Regardless of cliff height, birds reared on the floor were less likely to cross the visual cliff at 8 and 16 weeks of age than single and two-tier treatment birds (p = 0.01). However, these differences were not observed after they were given experience with elevated structures in the adult aviary. The results of the present study suggest that the lack of exposure to vertical complexity during rearing do not cause long-term detriments to depth perception, but could impact successful engagement with elevated heights (i.e., hesitancy to access vertical structures). Further research is needed to determine the timing, quality, and quantity of elevated height exposure that is needed in the rearing environment to encourage sufficient use of vertical space in the adult aviary for cage-free laying hens.",

    "issued": "2024-12",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of including midazolam to a common equine standing sedation protocol for routine oral examination. Twelve horses underwent two examinations at least seven days apart. Horses were randomly assigned to receive midazolam intravenously (IV) (0.02mg/kg) or a placebo injection of saline (2-2.5mL IV). Five minutes later, detomidine (0.01mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.01mg/kg) were administered IV and horses were placed in standing stocks. A veterinarian blinded to the treatment protocol used a descriptive scoring system to assess degree of ataxia, acceptance of speculum, chewing on the speculum, headshaking, tongue movement, resistance to palpation, and eye appearance as related to the grimace score. During each examination, additional sedation of IV detomidine (0.006mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.006mg/kg) was administered at the discretion of the blinded practitioner to facilitate safe examination. At the second examination horses received the opposite treatment protocol and, following examination, a routine occlusal adjustment. Scores were compared using JMP software with a repeated measures mixed effects model, treatment as a fixed effect and horse and horse/treatment interaction as random effects. Significance was set at P<0.05. There were no significant differences in any of the single or overall sedation scores between treatment groups or within individual horses (P=0.3). Trends towards improvement of some assessed characteristics of sedation, including decreased tongue movement and less resistance to acceptance of speculum were observed. The use of midazolam may prove beneficial for routine oral examination, as well as other standing procedures, with no obvious undesired side effects.",

    "abstract": "Fetal age in Quarter Horses can be predicted within 2 weeks from 100- to 200- days of gestation using femur length, biparietal diameter (cranium diameter) and eye approximated volume. However, as pregnancy advances, the femur and cranium become too large to be imaged in their entirety using ultrasound and the corresponding biometric parameters can no longer be measured. In this longitudinal study, the proximal phalanx (P1) was evaluated as a novel biometric parameter for late gestation to predict fetal age and bone maturation. Transrectal ultrasound was performed in ten pregnant mares with known ovulation dates, every two weeks from 240- days of gestation until parturition. P1 was imaged in 69 % of the examinations. Inability to image P1 was due to obstructive positioning such as carpal or fetlock flexion, or posterior presentation of the fetus. Advancing fetal age did not affect visibility of P1. P1 length correlated significantly with days of gestation and a correlation equation was established: y = 0.3837x -69.55 where y is the predicted value of P1 length and x is the day of gestation (with day 0 being the day of ovulation). When P1 length was equal to or larger than the width of the ultrasound image (52.5 mm), 90 % of mares (9/10) were above 300- days of gestation. Ossification of the proximal and distal epiphysis of P1 typically appeared between 277- and 303 -days of gestation (mean: 288 days). The proximal epiphysis did not close before parturition whereas the distal one closed between 306- and 333-days of gestation (mean: 320 days). P1 epiphyseal appearance and closure occurred chronologically reflecting bone maturation. Radiographic findings at birth and prenatal ultrasound findings were in agreement, apart from timing of P1 distal epiphyseal closure. In conclusion, P1 length can be used as a new fetal biometric parameter to assess fetal age and growth after 240- days of gestation. The knowledge of P1 bone maturation process in utero as a marker for fetal bone development, may also be valuable in clinical decision-making when considering inducing parturition in the mare.",

    "abstract": "No current treatments available halt osteoarthritis progression in horses or humans. Intra-articular injection of mitochondria is a novel treatment that has the potential to improve cell metabolism and decrease inflammation, but safety of this treatment has yet to be established in the horse. Autologous blood-derived mitochondria isolated using a commercially available kit were injected into the left carpus joint of 3 horses which were monitored for 28 days. Horses received physical examinations, video recorded gait evaluations, joint diameter measurement, synovial fluid collection, and blood collection on day 0 (baseline prior to mitotherapy, day of mitochondria injection), 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Systemic inflammation was assessed via complete blood count, fibrinogen, and plasma serum amyloid A (SAA). Local inflammation was assessed via synovial fluid cytology and physical examination parameters. Physical exam parameters remained stable and no joint swelling was observed after mitotherapy. No change was noted in video recorded gait evaluations as determined by a blinded evaluator. Complete blood counts revealed no significant increase in white blood cells. SAA only increased mildly in 1 horse. Fibrinogen became slightly elevated above reference range in 2 horses at day 7, but later normalized. Mild increases in synovial fluid nucleated cell counts and total protein occurred on day 1 and 3, but resolved within 7 days without intervention. Autologous mitochondria injection into the equine intercarpal joint was well tolerated with no signs of inflammation. This safety information allows for future studies evaluating mitotherapy efficacy.",

    "issued": "2023-04",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to define the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression pattern of the equine ocular surface and amniotic membrane using a targeted qPCR approach and 3'Tag-sequencing. It will serve as a reference for future studies of ocular surface innate immunity and amniotic membrane therapies. PROCEDURES: A targeted qPCR approach was used to investigate the presence of orthologs for three of the most highly expressed beta-defensins (DEFB1, DEFB4B, and DEFB103A) of the human ocular surface and amniotic membrane in equine corneal epithelium, conjunctiva, and amniotic membrane. 3'Tag-sequencing was performed on RNA from one sample of corneal epithelium, conjunctiva, and amniotic membrane to further characterize their AMP expression. RESULTS: Equine corneal epithelium, conjunctiva, and amniotic membrane expressed DEFB1, DEFB4B, and DEFB103A. DEFB103A was expressed at the highest amounts in corneal epithelium, while DEFB4B was most highly expressed in conjunctiva and amniotic membrane. 3'Tag-sequencing from all three tissues confirmed these findings and identified expression of five additional beta-defensins, 11 alpha-defensins and two cathelicidins, with the alpha-defensins showing higher normalized read counts than the beta-defensins. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified AMP expression in the equine cornea and conjunctiva, suggesting that they play a key role in the protection of the equine eye, similar to the human ocular surface. We also determined that equine amniotic membrane expresses a substantial number of AMPs suggesting it could potentiate an antimicrobial effect as a corneal graft material. Future studies will focus on defining the antimicrobial activity of these AMPs and determining their role in microbial keratitis.",

    "issued": "2023",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), an immune mediated disease characterized by repeated episodes of intra-ocular inflammation, affects 25% of horses in the USA and is the most common cause of glaucoma, cataracts, and blindness. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have immunomodulatory properties, which are upregulated by preconditioning with toll-like receptor agonists. The objective was to evaluate safety and migration of TLR-3 agonist polyinosinic, polycytidylic acid (pIC)-activated MSCs injected subconjunctivally in healthy horses prior to clinical application in horses with ERU. We hypothesized that activated allogeneic MSCs injected subconjunctivally would not induce ocular or systemic inflammation and would remain in the conjunctiva for >14 days. METHODS: Bulbar subconjunctiva of two horses was injected with 10 × 106 pIC-activated (10 μg/mL, 2 h) GFP-labeled MSCs from one donor three times at two-week intervals. Vehicle (saline) control was injected in the contralateral conjunctiva. Horses received physical and ophthalmic exams [slit lamp biomicroscopy, rebound tonometry, fundic examination, and semiquantitative preclinical ocular toxicology scoring (SPOTS)] every 1-3 days. Systemic inflammation was assessed via CBC, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A (SAA). Horses were euthanized 14 days following final injection. Full necropsy and histopathology were performed to examine ocular tissues and 36 systemic organs for MSC presence via IVIS Spectrum. Anti-GFP immunohistochemistry was performed on ocular tissues. RESULTS: No change in physical examinations was noted. Bloodwork revealed fibrinogen 100-300 mg/dL (ref 100-400) and SAA 0-25 μg/mL (ref 0-20). Ocular effects of the subjconjucntival injection were similar between MSC and control eyes on SPOTS grading system, with conjunctival hypermia, chemosis and ocular discharge noted bilaterally, which improved without intervention within 14 days. All other ocular parameters were unaffected throughout the study. Necropsy and histopathology revealed no evidence of systemic inflammation. Ocular histopathology was similar between MSC and control eyes. Fluorescent imaging analysis did not locate MSCs. Immunohistochemistry did not identify intact MSCs in the conjunctiva, but GFP-labeled cellular components were present in conjunctival phagocytic cells. DISCUSSION: Allogeneic pIC-activated conjunctival MSC injections were well tolerated. GFP-labeled tracking identified MSC components phagocytosed by immune cells subconjunctivally. This preliminary safety and tracking information is critical towards advancing immune conditioned cellular therapies to clinical trials in horses.",

However, a close examination of the publications produced by the Russian and British missions to its ruler, Ya'qub Beg, militates against interpreting these missions as merely another episode of the Great Game, the century-long struggle for influence in Central and High Asia. Rather, Russian and British diplomats and travellers participated in a common culture of exploration, sharing a purpose and a European identity. This self-identification, in turn, was closely connected with the practice of exploration: objective measurement and scientific inquiry were coded as activities differentiating Russian and British travellers from the objects of their study. Although the information so gathered had political and strategic utility, the international networks and common values involved in its production established a network of mutual interests, respect, and cooperation even during moments of heightened geopolitical tension. © 2014 Southseries Inc.",

    "issued": "2025-04",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Acute organophosphate (OP) intoxication affects a significant number of individuals worldwide. Those who survive OP-induced cholinergic crisis, which includes status epilepticus, often develop neurological morbidities. Here, we provide a rigorous characterization of the acute and delayed electrophysiological responses to OP intoxication with the goal of identifying early electrophysiological changes that predict later brain changes, including spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). METHODS: Male and female rats were implanted with electroencephalographic (EEG) and intracranial EEG electrodes prior to acute intoxication with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). All animals received standard of care therapeutics and were recorded continuously for 70 min post-DFP, then again for 5 min at 180 min post-DFP, 1 day postexposure (DPE), 3 DPE, and 7 DPE. Between 7 and 14 DPE, animals were recorded continuously. RESULTS: In both sexes, acute DFP intoxication produced rapid and robust elevations in broadband power that were reduced but not terminated by midazolam (MDZ). Theta-delta ratio (TDR) was reduced immediately following DFP exposure and was further depressed by MDZ intervention. In the days that followed, broadband power and TDR recovered toward baseline. From 7 to 14 DPE, electrographic spiking was observed in all animals, and 80% developed SRS. Increased broadband power during status epilepticus was positively correlated with spike rate and SRS frequency. Slower recovery of broadband power to baseline in the days following exposure also correlated with increased SRS burden. Finally, a higher acute TDR correlated with increased spike rates at 3 and 7 DPE. SIGNIFICANCE: The data presented in this study provide a rigorous characterization of post-DFP electrographic sequelae that significantly extends the field's current understanding of electrophysiological shifts caused by acute OP intoxication. Critically, we identified potential EEG-based biomarkers that may identify at-risk patients in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Effective data management and sharing have become increasingly crucial in biomedical research; however, many laboratory researchers lack the necessary tools and knowledge to address this challenge. This article provides an introductory guide into research data management (RDM), and the importance of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data-sharing principles for laboratory researchers produced by practicing scientists. We explore the advantages of implementing organized data management strategies and introduce key concepts such as data standards, data documentation, and the distinction between machine and human-readable data formats. Furthermore, we offer practical guidance for creating a data management plan and establishing efficient data workflows within the laboratory setting, suitable for labs of all sizes. This includes an examination of requirements analysis, the development of a data dictionary for routine data elements, the implementation of unique subject identifiers, and the formulation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for seamless data flow. To aid researchers in implementing these practices, we present a simple organizational system as an illustrative example, which can be tailored to suit individual needs and research requirements. By presenting a user-friendly approach, this guide serves as an introduction to the field of RDM and offers practical tips to help researchers effortlessly meet the common data management and sharing mandates rapidly becoming prevalent in biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of cognitive decline after intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in some patients continue to be poorly understood. Multiple rodent models of intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage have only shown mild or even no cognitive impairment on subsequent behavioral testing. In this study, we show that intraventricular hemorrhage only leads to a significant spatial memory deficit in the Morris water maze if it occurs in the setting of an elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Histopathological analysis of these IVH + ICP animals did not show evidence of neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal formation after 2 weeks but instead showed significant microglial activation measured by lacunarity and fractal dimensions. RNA sequencing of the hippocampus showed distinct enrichment of genes in the IVH + ICP group but not in IVH alone having activated microglial signaling pathways. The most significantly activated signaling pathway was the classical complement pathway, which is used by microglia to remove synapses, followed by activation of the Fc receptor and DAP12 pathways. Thus, our study lays the groundwork for identifying signaling pathways that could be targeted to ameliorate behavioral deficits after IVH.",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies demonstrated that traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ventricular administration of thrombin caused hippocampal neuron loss and cognitive dysfunction via activation of Src family kinases (SFKs). Based on SFK localization in brain, we hypothesized SFK subtypes Fyn and c-Src, as well as SFK downstream molecule Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), contribute to cell death and cognitive dysfunction after TBI. We administered nanoparticle wrapped small interfering RNA (siRNA)-Fyn and siRNA-c-Src, or ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to adult rats subjected to moderate lateral fluid percussion (LFP)-induced TBI. Spatial memory function was assessed from 12 to 16 days, and NeuN stained hippocampal neurons were assessed 16 days after TBI. The combination of siRNA-Fyn and siRNA-c-Src, but neither alone, prevented hippocampal neuron loss and spatial memory deficits after TBI. The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 also prevented hippocampal neuronal loss and spatial memory deficits after TBI. The data suggest that the combined actions of three kinases (Fyn, c-Src, ROCK) mediate hippocampal neuronal cell death and spatial memory deficits produced by LFP-TBI, and that inhibiting this pathway prevents the TBI-induced cell death and memory deficits.",

    "abstract": "Sports-related injury is frequently associated with repeated diffuse and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). We combined two existing models for inducing TBI in rats, the Impact Acceleration and Controlled Cortical Impact models, to create a new method relevant to the study of cognitive sequelae of repeat mTBI in adolescent athletes. Repeated mTBI, such as those incurred in sports, can result in a wide range of outcomes, with many individuals experiencing no chronic sequela while others develop profound cognitive and behavioral impairments, typically in the absence of lasting motor symptoms or gross tissue loss appreciable antemortem. It is critical to develop models of mTBI and repeat mTBI that have the flexibility to assess multiple parameters related to injury (e.g. number and magnitude of impacts, inter-injury interval, etc) that are associated with brain vulnerability compared to normal recovery. We designed a 3D-printed plastic implant to permanently secure a metal disc to the skull of adolescent rats in order to induce multiple injuries without performing multiple survival surgeries and also to minimize pre-injury anesthesia time. Rats were randomly assigned to sham injury (n = 12), single injury (n = 12; injury on P41), or repeat injury (n = 14; injuries on P35, P38, and P41) groups. Compared to single injury and sham injury, repeat injuries caused increased toe pinch reflex latency (F(2,34) = 4.126, p < .05) and diminished weight gain (F(2, 34) = 4.767, p < .05). Spatial navigation was tested using Morris water maze, beginning one week after the final injury (P48). While there were no differences between groups during acquisition, both single and repeat injuries resulted in deficits on probe trial performance (p < .01 and p < .05 respectively). Single injury animals also exhibited a deficit in working memory deficit across three days of testing (p < .05). Neither injury group had neuronal loss in the hilus or CA3, according to stereological quantification of NeuN. Therefore, by implanting a helmet we have created a relevant model of sports-related injury and repeated mTBI that results in subtle but significant changes in cognitive outcome in the absence of significant hippocampal cell death.",

    "issued": "2025-01",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Current technologies to define the zone of acute peripheral nerve injury intraoperatively are limited by surgical experience, time, cumbersome electrodiagnostic equipment, and interpreter reliability. In this pilot study, we evaluated a real-time, label-free optical technique for intraoperative nerve injury imaging. We hypothesize that fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) will detect a difference between the time-resolved fluorescence signatures for acute crush injuries versus uninjured segments of peripheral nerves in sheep. METHODS: Label-free FLIm uses ultraviolet laser pulses to excite endogenous tissue fluorophores and detect their fluorescent decay over time, generating real-time tissue-specific signatures. A crush injury was produced in eight peripheral nerves of two sheep. A hand-held FLIm instrument captured the time-resolved fluorescence signatures of injured and uninjured nerve segments across three spectral emission channels (390/40 nm, 470/28 nm, and 540/50 nm). The average FLIm parameters (ie, lifetime and intensity ratios) for injured and uninjured nerve segments were compared. We used linear discriminant analysis to differentiate between crushed and uninjured nerve segments. RESULTS: A total of 23,692 point measurements were collected from eight crushed peripheral nerves of two sheep. Histology confirmed the zone of injury. Average lifetime at 470 nm and 540 nm were significantly different between crushed and uninjured sheep nerve segments. The linear discriminant analysis differentiated between crushed and uninjured areas of eight nerve segments with 92% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and 88% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, FLIm detected differing average lifetime values for crushed versus uninjured sheep peripheral nerves with high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With further investigation, FLIm may guide the peripheral nerve surgeon to the precise zone of injury for reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Label-free biomedical imaging represents a range of powerful technologies used to visualize natural sources of biological contrast. Label-free techniques such as autofluorescence and fluorescence lifetime imaging measure contrast produced by various cellular products and provide high sensitivity for detecting tissue changes that occur with disease onset. However, a major limitation of these modalities, and many label-free modalities broadly, is the lack of robust validation methods that confirm signal specificity. Moreover, existing approaches are limited to assessing correlations and fail to provide mechanistic information into pathological events. Spatially resolved gene sequencing methods (e.g., spatial transcriptomics) are a powerful tool to gain detailed biological insight into tissue properties by creating 2-D maps of variations in gene expression that influence tissue properties. Thus, these techniques represent an avenue for validation of label-free imaging markers through the examination of how label-free image features correspond to gene expression. Toward this aim, we performed autofluorescence and fluorescence lifetime imaging on tissue specimens from four patients presenting with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. We then performed spatial transcriptome sequencing on serial tissue sections to measure transcriptome-wide signatures. We assessed imaging biomarkers related to cellular metabolism, vasculature, and extracellular matrix properties. After registering the label-free images to the transcriptomic signatures, we performed k-means clustering, and assessed the correlation between imaging markers and differentially expressed genes associated with tissue properties of interest. Specifically, we aimed to examine correlations between gene expression and established optical biomarkers (e.g., optical redox ratio), along with identifying other potential connections between label-free optics and cellular genetics. The results show that spatial transcriptomics can be used as an effective validation tool for label-free imaging markers, while simultaneously providing additional biological insight to improve the specificity of imaging studies.",

    "abstract": "Substituting Portland cement (PC) with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) is a key strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Considering alternative SCMs requires a holistic understanding of changes to material performance, emissions reduction potential, and regional availability. Four rice hull ashes (RHAs) and one rice straw ash (RSA) were evaluated to replace PC in mortars (10% untreated ash and 30% blast furnace slag; 15% untreated ash; or 15% milled ash). The 28-day compressive strengths with 0.59 water-to-binder ratio for fly-RHAs (38.0–49.8 MPa) and RSA (37.7 - 44.1 MPa) did not vary significantly from the PC control (43.2 MPa) based on an ANOVA. Modeling rice biomass generation in six U.S. states shows RSA could triple the supply of rice-biomass ash, but in states with substantial PC demand, i.e., California and Texas, the potential GHG reduction may remain small (∼1–2%). RSA and RHA may hold promise in lowering concrete GHG emissions.",

A cost-benefit study and an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) were performed to compute the impacts of water soaking, drying, and reverse osmosis (RO) of the leachate to factor in the use of rice straw as feedstock at biomass energy plants, RSA for concrete, and the RO-treated leachate as fertilizer and water for farms. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the sale of electrical energy from biomass, RSA, and fertilizer required further optimization of the processes to become profitable for the involved parties. The LCA showed a global warming avoidance equivalent to net -15kgCO2-eq per tonne of rice straw that could be achieved by substituting fossil fuel energy resources and cement avoidance in concrete.",

    "abstract": "The increase in global consumption of disposable products has led to a significant increase in waste generation. Life cycle assessment (LCA) serves as a methodology to evaluate the environmental impact of products and processes throughout their entire life cycle. In recent years, there has been a surge in LCA studies focused on incorporating waste and recycled materials, such as recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), polymers, waste plastics, glass, crumb rubber, etc., into asphalt mixtures for pavement construction to enhance mechanical performance and achieve environmental benefits. This study reviewed the existing literature on LCA for these materials. In addition to energy consumption and global warming, researchers are now also focusing on other impact categories, including ozone depletion, acidification, human health particulate matter, leaching, and other factors, emphasizing their significance. Utilizing recycled materials like RAP or polymers in asphalt mixtures may reduce environmental burdens, but their storage, handling, and preparation processes may pose health risks due to water contamination and increased air pollution. The recommendations aim to offer suggestions for future research in pavement LCA.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this research is to evaluate the changes in fatigue and age-related cracking properties of asphalt mixes due to the addition of high contents (up to 50 % binder replacement) of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and recycled asphalt shingles (RAS), and recycling agents (RA). To achieve this goal, a total of 18 binder blends along with their corresponding selective mixes have been fabricated and tested in the laboratory. The collection of mixes includes one gradation with 0.5-inch nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS), two virgin binders (PG 64–16 and PG 58–28), two RAPs with different levels of aging (PG high of 102°C and 109°C, respectively), one RAS, and two recycling agents (aromatic-based and tall oil-based). The testing of the binder blends includes PG-grading and frequency-sweep dynamic modulus tests. The testing of the mixes includes stiffness, four-point bending (4PB) fatigue resistance, and IDEAL cracking test. The main conclusion from this study is that most of the negative effects on both kinds of cracking of RAP/RAS addition can be mitigated by using RA and/or step-down binders. The results of this study indicate that mix stiffness and indirect tensile strength (ITS) showed strong correlations with different parameters obtained from fabricated binder blends. On the contrary, the blended binder and mix properties which primarily focus on stiffness, and do not involve repeated loading, did not correlate well with the 4PB fatigue life. The main difference between the two RAs was that the aromatic required a higher dose (around 60 % higher) than the tall oil to produce similar effects on the mechanical properties of asphalt mixes.",

    "abstract": "The management of waste tires has become a significant concern in recent years, and the inclusion of high-content crumb rubber (HCR) into asphalt effectively mitigates waste tire pollution, which can provide sustainable environmental and economic benefits. However, conventional rubberized binders have been significantly limited by their high viscosity and poor storage stability in practical engineering applications. Researchers have pretreated crumb rubber (CR) with oil to address these issues, but high-temperature performance is not sufficient. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a preparation process for environmentally friendly high-content pretreated crumb rubber-modified asphalt (HPCRMA), which incorporates high-content pretreated crumb rubber (HPCR), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), recycled low-density polyethylene (RLDPE), and sulfur (S) to achieve excellent construction workability, storage stability, and superior high-temperature rutting resistance, low-temperature cracking resistance, and enhanced resilience. The results show that the HPCR in asphalt improved construction workability, storage stability, and low-temperature cracking resistance than high-content untreated crumb rubber (HUCR) but significantly reduced high-temperature rutting resistance. The inclusion of SBS in HPCRMA improved high-temperature rutting resistance and low-temperature cracking resistance due to increased elasticity and flexibility, while RLDPE enhanced rutting resistance but reduced cracking resistance. In addition, the sulfur further improved both properties through cross-linking reactions. The 20 %HPCR+ 4 %SBS+ 0.6 %S specimen exhibited superior rheological properties, which achieved a performance grade (PG) of 94–34. Overall, this study proposes the potential of utilizing waste materials to enhance the sustainability and resilience of pavement materials to promote resource conservation and environmental protection.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the grain boundary energy dependence on segregated dopants in nanocrystalline zinc aluminate ceramics. Atomistic simulations of Σ3 and Σ9 grain boundaries showed that trivalent ions of varying ionic radii [Sc3+ (74.5 pm), In3+ (80.0 pm), Y3+ (90.0 pm), and Nd3+ (98.3 pm)] have a tendency to segregate to both interfaces, with Y3+ presenting the highest segregation potentials. The connection between segregation and the reduction of interfacial energies was explored by measuring the grain boundary energy on nanoceramics fabricated via high-pressure spark plasma sintering (HP-SPS) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results revealed that Y3+ doping at 0.5 mol% reduces the grain boundary energy in zinc aluminate nanoceramics from 1.1–1.3 J/m2 to 0.6–0.8 J/m2; the range correlates with the observed size dependence of the excess energy, with higher values observed for the smaller grain sizes (∼17 nm). The noted decrease in interfacial energies for doped samples suggests it is indeed possible to alter the stability of zinc aluminate grain boundaries via dopant segregation.",

The line, surface, and volumetric terms associated with twin nucleation are identified. A micromechanical model is proposed where the stress field around the twin nucleus is estimated using the Eshelby formalism, and the contributions of the various twin-related structures to the potential energy of the twin are evaluated. The reduction in the grain boundary energy arising from the change in character of the prior grain boundary is found to offset the energy costs of the other interfaces. The defect structures bounding the stacking faults that form inside the twin are also found to possibly have significant energetic contributions. These results suggest that both of these effects could be more significant than has been assumed by many earlier continuum-scale twin nucleation models and are perhaps critical considerations when predicting twin nucleationNucleation sites in magnesiumMagnesium.",

    "abstract": "Nanoporous gold (np-Au) has found its use in applications ranging from catalysis to biosensing, where pore morphology plays a critical role in performance. While the morphology evolution of bulk np-Au has been widely studied, knowledge about its thin-film form is limited. This work hypothesizes that the mechanical compliance of the thin film substrate can play a critical role in the morphology evolution. Via experimental and finite-element-analysis approaches, we investigate the morphological variation in np-Au thin films deposited on compliant silicone (PDMS) substrates of a range of thicknesses anchored on rigid glass supports and compare those to the morphology of np-Au deposited on glass. More macroscopic (10 s to 100 s of microns) cracks and discrete islands form in the np-Au films on PDMS compared to on glass. Conversely, uniformly distributed microscopic (100 s of nanometers) cracks form in greater numbers in the np-Au films on glass than those on PDMS, with the cracks located within the discrete islands. The np-Au films on glass also show larger ligament and pore sizes, possibly due to higher residual stresses compared to the np-Au/PDMS films. The effective elastic modulus of the substrate layers decreases with increasing PDMS thickness, resulting in secondary np-Au morphology effects, including a reduction in macroscopic crack-to-crack distance, an increase in microscopic crack coverage, and a widening of the microscopic cracks. However, changes in the ligament/pore widths with PDMS thickness are negligible, allowing for independent optimization for cracking. We expect these results to inform the integration of functional np-Au films on compliant substrates into emerging applications, including flexible electronics.",

The metals considered include Fe, equiatomic CrCoNi, and a fictitious metal with similar bulk properties to the CrCoNi composed of a single atom type referred to as an A-atom. CrCoNi is found to sustain higher concentrations of dislocations than either the Fe or A-atom systems and more stacking faults than the A-atom system. The results suggest that the difference between the concentrations of vacancies and interstitials is substantially smaller for CrCoNi than the A-atom system, perhaps reflecting that the sink capture radius is smaller in CrCoNi due to the roughened potential energy landscape. A model that partitions the major contributions from defects to the stored energy is described, and serves to highlight a general need for higher fidelity approaches to point defect identification.",

    "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a common dermatological diagnosis observed in pediatric patients with skin of color, often resulting in scarring, keloid formation, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, significantly impacting their quality of life. This exploratory retrospective chart review included 77 black pediatric patients seen at a tertiary care center for acne vulgaris between 2018 and 2023. We analyzed demographics, acne descriptors, and treatment modalities. The most common acne morphology was comedonal acne (83.6%), with 71% of the patients being female. Significant age differences were observed particularly for acne at the chin and overall face. Treatment regimens commonly prescribed included combinations of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide (22%), topical antibiotics, tretinoin, and benzoyl peroxide (34%). Given the higher risk of sequelae for patients with darker skin, it is crucial to address their unique treatment needs. This study highlights the distinctive characteristics of acne in black pediatric patients and calls for further research to enhance our understanding and treatment of this population. Limitations include the lack of direct patient interactions and reliance on chart data. Further studies are needed to compare acne presentation in skin of color of other populations, refining our knowledge of acne clinical presentation, complications, and treatment modalities for diverse patient populations.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare but potentially fatal drug hypersensitivity reaction. To our knowledge, there is no international consensus on its severity assessment and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To reach an international, Delphi-based multinational expert consensus on the diagnostic workup, severity assessment, and treatment of patients with DRESS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Delphi method was used to assess 100 statements related to baseline workup, evaluation of severity, acute phase, and postacute management of DRESS. Fifty-seven international experts in DRESS were invited, and 54 participated in the survey, which took place from July to September 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES/MEASURES: The degree of agreement was calculated with the RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Method. Consensus was defined as a statement with a median appropriateness value of 7 or higher (appropriate) and a disagreement index of lower than 1. RESULTS: In the first Delphi round, consensus was reached on 82 statements. Thirteen statements were revised and assessed in a second round. A consensus was reached for 93 statements overall. The experts agreed on a set of basic diagnostic workup procedures as well as severity- and organ-specific further investigations. They reached a consensus on severity assessment (mild, moderate, and severe) based on the extent of liver, kidney, and blood involvement and the damage of other organs. The panel agreed on the main lines of DRESS management according to these severity grades. General recommendations were generated on the postacute phase follow-up of patients with DRESS and the allergological workup. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This Delphi exercise represents, to our knowledge, the first international expert consensus on diagnostic workup, severity assessment, and management of DRESS. This should support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of DRESS and constitute the basis for development of future guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Dominant X-linked diseases are uncommon due to female X chromosome inactivation (XCI). While random XCI usually protects females against X-linked mutations, Rett syndrome (RTT) is a female neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous MECP2 mutation. After 6-18 months of typical neurodevelopment, RTT girls undergo a poorly understood regression. We performed longitudinal snRNA-seq on cerebral cortex in a construct-relevant Mecp2e1 mutant mouse model of RTT, revealing transcriptional effects of cell type, mosaicism, and sex on progressive disease phenotypes. Across cell types, we observed sex differences in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with 6x more DEGs in mutant females than males. Unlike males, female DEGs emerged prior to symptoms, were enriched for homeostatic gene pathways in distinct cell types over time and correlated with disease phenotypes and human RTT cortical cell transcriptomes. Non-cell-autonomous effects were prominent and dynamic across disease progression of Mecp2e1 mutant females, indicating that wild-type-expressing cells normalize transcriptional homeostasis. These results advance our understanding of RTT progression and treatment.",

Here, we report the effects of prenatal exposure to a human-relevant mixture of PCBs on the DNA methylation profiles of mouse placenta and fetal brain. Thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) distinguish placenta and fetal brain from PCB-exposed mice from sex-matched vehicle controls. In both placenta and fetal brain, PCB-associated DMRs are enriched for functions related to neurodevelopment and cellular signaling and enriched within regions of bivalent chromatin. The placenta and brain PCB DMRs overlap significantly and map to a shared subset of genes enriched for Wnt signaling, Slit/Robo signaling, and genes differentially expressed in NDD models. The consensus PCB DMRs also significantly overlap with DMRs from human NDD brain and placenta. These results demonstrate that PCB-exposed placenta contains a subset of DMRs that overlap fetal brain DMRs relevant to an NDD.",

    "issued": "2022-02-16",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves complex genetics interacting with the perinatal environment, complicating the discovery of common genetic risk. The epigenetic layer of DNA methylation shows dynamic developmental changes and molecular memory of in utero experiences, particularly in placenta, a fetal tissue discarded at birth. However, current array-based methods to identify novel ASD risk genes lack coverage of the most structurally and epigenetically variable regions of the human genome. RESULTS: We use whole genome bisulfite sequencing in placenta samples from prospective ASD studies to discover a previously uncharacterized ASD risk gene, LOC105373085, renamed NHIP. Out of 134 differentially methylated regions associated with ASD in placental samples, a cluster at 22q13.33 corresponds to a 118-kb hypomethylated block that replicates in two additional cohorts. Within this locus, NHIP is functionally characterized as a nuclear peptide-encoding transcript with high expression in brain, and increased expression following neuronal differentiation or hypoxia, but decreased expression in ASD placenta and brain. NHIP overexpression increases cellular proliferation and alters expression of genes regulating synapses and neurogenesis, overlapping significantly with known ASD risk genes and NHIP-associated genes in ASD brain. A common structural variant disrupting the proximity of NHIP to a fetal brain enhancer is associated with NHIP expression and methylation levels and ASD risk, demonstrating a common genetic influence. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results identify and initially characterize a novel environmentally responsive ASD risk gene relevant to brain development in a hitherto under-characterized region of the human genome.",

For more susceptible cultivars, disease severity is strongly influenced by inoculum levels and ambient temperature.

    "abstract": "An integrated map for lettuce comprising of 2,744 markers was developed from seven intra- and inter-specific mapping populations. A total of 560 markers that segregated in two or more populations were used to align the individual maps. 2,073 AFLP, 152 RFLP, 130 SSR, and 360 RAPD as well as 29 other markers were assigned to nine chromosomal linkage groups that spanned a total of 1,505 cM and ranged from 136 to 238 cM. The maximum interval between markers in the integrated map is 43 cM and the mean interval is 0.7 cM. The majority of markers segregated close to Mendelian expectations in the intra-specific crosses. In the two L. saligna x L. sativa inter-specific crosses, a total of 155 and 116 markers in 13 regions exhibited significant segregation distortion. Data visualization tools were developed to curate, display and query the data. The integrated map provides a framework for mapping ESTs in one core mapping population relative to phenotypes that segregate in other populations. It also provides large numbers of markers for marker assisted selection, candidate gene identification, and studies of genome evolution in the Compositae.",

    "abstract": "During droughts, potable water agencies may need to increase supply or reduce demand. Water agencies have many options for water demand management (WDM), including low flow toilets, showerheads, faucet aerators, educational outreach, and more. Reduced water consumption may result in energy savings, both at the customer and utility level. In this study, we estimated household water, electricity, and natural gas and utility-wide energy savings using statistical modeling for four large water demand management programs implemented between 2014 and 2018 in California. These programs focused on single and multifamily retrofit programs. These retrospective analyses were performed using household-level data gathered from multiple water, electricity, and natural gas companies. We found detectable water savings in three of the four programs, no detectable electricity savings for any program, and detectable gas savings in only one program. The deemed estimates of water savings were generally inaccurate predictors of actual savings. All programs that reduced household water consumption also reduced system-wide electricity consumption. A benefit-cost analysis was performed for each program from the perspectives of three stakeholders: water utilities, households, and a regulatory authority responsible for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Many of the program actions were not cost-effective for the participating utilities and households because of the low cost of water. For the WDM programs considered here cost-effective from the perspective of the water utilities, the opportunity cost of consuming an additional unit of water would have to exceed their observed variable production costs in 2020 by a factor of 3 to nearly 20, dependent on the utility. In settings with sufficiently severe drought conditions and impending water scarcity, it is certainly plausible to expect that the opportunity cost of water consumption could reach such levels. WDM is an effective method of reducing GHG emissions for programs that target hot water savings, and the cost of these programs was consistent with non-water-related programs that target GHG emission reductions.",

Across markets worldwide, average curtailment rates for wind and solar are generally quite low, often around 3%. However, these low average curtailment rates may overstate how much renewable supply increases as a result of further increases in renewable capacity. Using historical hourly generation and curtailment data from California's electricity market, we estimate that only 91% of the output supplied by new solar capacity goes towards increasing the state's renewable supply — with the remaining 9% being discarded in the form of increased curtailments.",

This recycling approach attains higher welfare and more equality than the lump-sum rebate approach preferred by policymakers as well as the approach originally prescribed by economists— which called exclusively for reductions in distortionary taxes.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty surrounding if the U.S. will implement a federal climate policy introduces risk into the decision to invest in long-lived capital assets, particularly those designed to use, or to replace fossil fuel. We develop a dynamic, general equilibrium model to quantify the macroeconomic impacts of this climate policy transition risk. The model incorporates beliefs over the likelihood that the government adopts a climate policy causing the economy to dynamically transition to a lower carbon steady state. We find that climate policy transition risk decreases carbon emissions today by causing investment to become relatively cleaner and output to fall. This result counters the Green Paradox, which argues that climate policy risk raises emissions today by increasing incentives to extract fossil fuel, expanding its supply. Even allowing for the supply-side response, we find the demand-side response dominates, and the net effect of climate policy transition risk is still to reduce emissions today.",

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of beef fat naturally enriched with TVA and RA on parameters related to glucose homoeostasis and associated metabolic markers in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Thirty-six male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) were fed for 19 weeks with either a control low-fat diet (CLF), a control high-fat diet (CHF), or a TVA+RA-enriched high-fat diet (EHF). Compared with CLF, feeding either CHF or EHF resulted in adverse metabolic outcomes associated with high-fat diets, including adiposity, impaired glucose control and hepatic steatosis. However, the EHF diet induced a significantly higher liver weight TAG content and elevated plasma alanine transaminase levels compared with the CHF diet. Collectively, the findings from this study suggest that EHF does not improve glucose tolerance and worsens liver steatosis in DIO mice. However, the adverse effects of EHF on the liver could be in part related to the presence of other trans-FA in the enriched beef fat.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Chronic excessive alcohol intake is a significant cause of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), a leading contributor to liver-related morbidity and mortality. The Src homology phosphatase 2 (Shp2; encoded by Ptpn11) is a widely expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase that modulates hepatic functions, but its role in ALD is mostly uncharted. MAIN METHODS: Herein, we explore the effects of liver-specific Shp2 genetic disruption using the established chronic-plus-binge mouse model of ALD. KEY FINDINGS: We report that the hepatic Shp2 disruption had beneficial effects and partially ameliorated ethanol-induced injury, inflammation, and steatosis in the liver. Consistently, Shp2 deficiency was associated with decreased ethanol-evoked activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and oxidative stress in the liver. Moreover, primary hepatocytes with Shp2 deficiency exhibited similar outcomes to those observed upon Shp2 disruption in vivo, including diminished ethanol-induced ERK activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of ERK in primary hepatocytes mimicked the effects of Shp2 deficiency and attenuated oxidative stress caused by ethanol. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these findings highlight Shp2 as a modulator of hepatic oxidative stress upon ethanol challenge and suggest the evaluation of this phosphatase as a potential therapeutic target for ALD.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a leading factor of liver-related death worldwide. ALD has various manifestations that include steatosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis and is currently without approved pharmacotherapies. The Src homology phosphatase 2 (Shp2) is a drug target in some cancers due to its positive regulation of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and cell proliferation. Shp2 pharmacological inhibition yields beneficial outcomes in animal disease models, but its impact on ALD remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate the effects of Shp2 inhibition and its validity using a preclinical mouse model of ALD. We report that the administration of SHP099, a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of Shp2, partially ameliorated ethanol-induced hepatic injury, inflammation, and steatosis in mice. Additionally, Shp2 inhibition was associated with reduced ethanol-evoked activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), oxidative, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver. Besides the liver, excessive alcohol consumption induces multi-organ injury and dysfunction, including the intestine. Notably, Shp2 inhibition diminished ethanol-induced intestinal inflammation and permeability, abrogated the reduction in tight junction protein expression, and the activation of ERK and stress signaling in the ileum. Collectively, Shp2 pharmacological inhibition mitigates the deleterious effects of ethanol in the liver and intestine in a mouse model of ALD. Given the multifactorial aspects underlying ALD pathogenesis, additional studies are needed to decipher the utility of Shp2 inhibition alone or as a component in a multitherapeutic regimen to combat this deadly malady.",

    "abstract": "Glomerular podocytes are instrumental for the barrier function of the kidney, and podocyte injury contributes to proteinuria and the deterioration of renal function. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an established metabolic regulator, and the inactivation of this phosphatase mitigates podocyte injury. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the substrates that mediate PTP1B actions in podocytes. This study aims to uncover novel substrates of PTP1B in podocytes and validate a leading candidate. To this end, using substrate-trapping and mass spectroscopy, we identified putative substrates of this phosphatase and investigated the actin cross-linking cytoskeletal protein alpha-actinin4. PTP1B and alpha-actinin4 co-localized in murine and human glomeruli and transiently transfected E11 podocyte cells. Additionally, podocyte PTP1B deficiency in vivo and culture was associated with elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of alpha-actinin4. Conversely, reconstitution of the knockdown cells with PTP1B attenuated alpha-actinin4 tyrosine phosphorylation. We demonstrated co-association between alpha-actinin4 and the PTP1B substrate-trapping mutant, which was enhanced upon insulin stimulation and disrupted by vanadate, consistent with an enzyme-substrate interaction. Moreover, we identified alpha-actinin4 tandem tyrosine residues 486/487 as mediators of its interaction with PTP1B. Furthermore, knockdown studies in E11 cells suggest that PTP1B and alpha-actinin4 are modulators of podocyte motility. These observations indicate that PTP1B and alpha-actinin4 are likely interacting partners in a signaling node that modulates podocyte function. Targeting PTP1B and plausibly this one of its substrates may represent a new therapeutic approach for podocyte injury that warrants additional investigation.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Trans vaccenic acid (TVA, trans11-18:1) is a natural trans fatty acid that is exclusively found in ruminant fats such as dairy, beef, and lamb. Increased circulating concentrations of TVA and its metabolites are epidemiologically related to a reduced risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, direct causative evidence is lacking, and the mechanisms are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether TVA can alleviate insulin resistance in diet-induced obese mice when compared with oleic acid (OA, cis9-18:1, the major dietary cis 18:1 isomer) or trans10-18:1 (a major industrial trans fatty acid isomer). Forty-eight male C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks old) were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD,10% kcal total fat), a high-fat diet (HFD) enriched with OA (HFD-OA; 45% kcal total fat, 6% kcal from pure OA), an HFD enriched with TVA (HFD-TVA; 45% kcal total fat, 6% kcal from pure TVA), or an HFD enriched with trans-10 18:1 (HFD-T10; 45% kcal total fat, 6% kcal from pure trans-10 18:1) for 19 weeks. The metabolic phenotype was characterized using a glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT). Insulin-sensitive tissues (muscle, liver, and adipose) were harvested and extracted for protein, which was analyzed for protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphorylated Akt (pAKT) by western blot using Vinculin as a loading control. The resulting band intensities were quantitated using the FluorChem 9900 program (Alpha Innotech). pAkt expression was normalized to Akt. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test. Our GTT results suggested a greater (P &amp;lt; 0.05) glucose intolerance in both HFD-TVA and HFD-T10 groups compared with the LFD group. Whereas HFD-OA-fed mice maintained their glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity despite greater body weight and adiposity. In agreement with GTT and ITT results, we found reduced (P &amp;lt; 0.05) Akt phosphorylation in the muscle of both HFD-TVA and HFD-T10 groups compared with LFD while there was no difference in phosphorylation level in the liver and adipose. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that contrary to our initial hypothesis, a large dose of TVA (6% of calorie intake) promotes glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. Further studies using the typical intake of TVA in humans (0.5 to 1% of calorie intake) are required to better understand the effects of TVA on glucose homeostasis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Although consumers are not very familiar with peach production in Florida, Florida peaches are the first domestic peaches produced in the United States, being available from mid-March through early May. Moreover, Florida peach acreage has increased 8.5-fold in the past 10 years. Using a conjoint-based experimental design and analysis, we measured U.S. consumer reactions to diverse groups of ideas describing peaches, including production regions, and identified attributes that positively and negatively influence consumer preference. The main objective of this research was to identify external and internal attributes that make the “ideal peach.” Are consumers willing to pay more for a locally grown peach? Will consumers prefer a Florida peach instead of a Georgia or California peach? The top three peach attributes identified were “juicy and fully ripe,” “strong peach aroma and sweet peach taste,” and “grown in Georgia.” Cluster analysis revealed two segments of consumers: consumers in the first segment focused on physical aspects of the peach, and consumers in the second segment were concerned with peach production regions and health benefits. The findings from this research will be helpful in developing marketing programs for Florida peaches as an item that is perfect for snacking because of their small size and desirable texture and flavor.",

    "abstract": "Two field experiments were carried out in Central Florida to determine the water requirements and crop coefficient (Kc) of young and adult low-chill peach trees grown in humid subtropical conditions. Peach trees of 'TropicBeauty' grafted on 'Flordaguard' were used. The first experiment was conducted from April 2016 to October 2018. Three weighing lysimeters were used to measure water losses every 30 min to obtain the daily actual evapotranspiration (ETA) of young peach trees. Kc was calculated using the measured water losses and grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Kc was plotted against the day of the year (DOY), a quadratic equation was fitted to the data, and the estimated Kc ranged from 0.22 to 0.67. The second experiment was conducted from September 2016 to August 2018. Soil volumetric water content was recorded every 10 min on the first 90 cm of the soil profile to calculate a soil water balance that could determine the crop evapotranspiration (ETc). The average daily Kc was calculated by the ratio of ETc to ETo and plotted against DOY. A quadratic equation was fitted to the data, and the estimated Kc ranged from 0.32 to 0.69.",

    "abstract": "Low-chill peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] cultivars allow Florida growers to become competitive by offering fruits earlier than northern states for premium prices. Due to the predominance of sandy soils in Florida, irrigation is required to ensure fruit production in peaches. Available irrigation recommendations and peach crop coefficients (Kc) were determined in Mediterranean and temperate climates, and they can overestimate water demand in humid subtropical climates. Thus, a two-year study was conducted in Citra, FL, aiming to determine the water requirements and Kc values for four-year-old peach trees in humid subtropical conditions. A daily soil water balance and the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was determined using soil volumetric water content recorded every 10 min. Five soil probes, each equipped with soil moisture sensors at 10, 20, 40, and 80 cm of soil depth representing soil depth layers of 0–15, 15–30, 30–60, and 60–90 cm, respectively placed under the tree canopy. The ratios of daily ETc and Penman-Monteith FAO-56 reference evapotranspiration were used to estimate Kc for phenological stages of adult (≥4-year-old) peach trees. A soil water depletion coefficient (Ks) was estimated obtaining a threshold of 25.8 % available soil water depletion before trees undergo water stress. Daily ETc ranged from 0.22 mm d−1 during dormancy to 3.65 mm d−1 during shoot development. Values of Kc for peach trees ranged from 0.30 during dormancy to 0.69 during fruit maturity. The use of peach tree Kc adapted for subtropical humid conditions reduce the estimated crop water requirements by 21 % compared to the Kc values reported in FAO-56 guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Scientific research is often characterized by schools of thought. We investigate whether these divisions are associated with differences in researchers' cognitive traits such as tolerance for ambiguity. These differences may guide researchers to prefer different problems, tackle identical problems in different ways, and even reach different conclusions when studying the same problems in the same way. We surveyed 7,973 researchers in psychological sciences and investigated links between what they research, their stances on open questions in the field, and their cognitive traits and dispositions. Our results show that researchers' stances on scientific questions are associated with what they research and with their cognitive traits. Further, these associations are detectable in their publication histories. These findings support the idea that divisions in scientific fields reflect differences in the researchers themselves, hinting that some divisions may be more difficult to bridge than suggested by a traditional view of data-driven scientific consensus.",

    "abstract": "Research Summary: This study investigates category innovation, when firms introduce a new label to pioneer a market category. I propose two antecedent pathways. The first is based on firms' material developments. Firms that combine categories in their products and technologies are more likely to use category innovation to communicate their position is not peripheral, but at the center of an emerging category. The second is contextual, in response to category leniency, when a market category has ambiguous social meaning. Central and peripheral firms in lenient categories use category innovation to send a clearer signal of their position. These pathways are countervailing: the more lenient a firm's categories, the weaker the relationship between category combination and category innovation. Exploratory analyses show category innovation is associated with firm success. Managerial Summary: Firms use category labels to communicate the market they are in. This article studies the linguistic tactic category innovation: when firms introduce a new label to signal the firm is carving out a new market. I find firms use this tactic when they (a) develop novel, category-combining products that do not fit into existing markets, or (b) are in a market that is not well-defined (a lenient market category). I also find that for firms in lenient markets, the relationship between novel products and category innovation weakens. Preliminary evidence uncovers an association between firms that use category innovation and their likelihood to IPO, suggesting this linguistic tactic may be part of successful firm strategies.",

    "abstract": "Mandated gender wage gap disclosure laws are an increasingly popular but relatively untested solution to gender-based compensation inequalities. Scholars and policymakers alike have argued that disclosure will lead to greater social accountability—either reputational harm for firms revealing large disparities or benefit for more-egalitarian organizations. Yet little research has directly tested this central assumption. We advance understanding of this issue by examining reactions from a key constituency affected by pay gaps: employees. We analyze the existence, magnitude, and persistence of changes in employees’ public affective evaluations of their employers on the review site Glassdoor in the wake of pay gap disclosures prompted by new regulations in the United Kingdom. We find a short-lived improvement in employees’ evaluations of organizations reporting pay parity, consistent with a reputational boost. At the same time, we find little evidence of a negative post-disclosure reaction from employees of firms reporting sizable gender-based disparities. We take an abductive approach to investigate these surprising findings, probing key assumptions and the viability of different plausible explanations for the results. We consider how our empirical findings can inform the development of novel theory in the areas of gender wage inequality, reputation, and transparency.",

This study investigates one risk that looms over such collaborations: If the corporate partner is later implicated in an industry scandal. Ideas are investigated in the context of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. First, we find that industry scandals differentially affect contentious and collaborative SMOs' ability to mobilize resources. SMOs that had collaborated with the oil and gas industry before the spill suffered from reduced public support after the spill, and those that had contentiously interacted with the industry enjoyed increased contributions. Second, we find that industry scandals affect SMOs' willingness to collaborate with firms in the future. We show that the Horizon oil spill produced a broad chilling effect on environmental SMOs' collaborations with firms both within and outside of the oil and gas industry. Our findings show that there are risks inherent to a collaborative strategy that cannot be fully mitigated. Further, we demonstrate that industry scandals represent critical exogenous events that affect social activists' tactical repertoires for engaging in private politics.",

    "issued": "2021-12",
    "abstract": "Destigmatization is an understudied social process in which the negative outcomes for a previously stigmatized group improve. We theorize that during a period of destigmatization, the effects of stigma persist more strongly for people stigmatized by association than for those directly stigmatized. We propose that this occurs because, during periods of destigmatization, conscious prejudice has diminished but nonconscious prejudice remains, so people correct for their explicit biases toward individuals with the stigmatizing trait but are unaware of their ongoing implicit prejudice toward those stigmatized by association. Our evidence comes from archival data on individual employment in film during the cold war years in Hollywood. It shows that as the stigma of being on an anticommunist blacklist weakened, the employment penalty for being a coworker of a blacklisted artist was greater than the penalty for actually having been on the blacklist itself. A supplemental experiment, designed to address the limitations of archival data, shows the same imbalanced employment penalties in another stigma currently undergoing destigmatization (that of physical disability). Paradoxically, as stigmas recede, harmful effects persist more for associates of stigmatized individuals than for the stigmatized themselves.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ex-vivo normothermic perfusion (EVNP) with a blood based perfusate has the potential to both assess viability of and repair high-risk organs prior to transplantation. The optimal perfusate is yet to be established. METHODS: We assessed hemodynamic, functional, and metabolic changes of eight paired high-risk human kidneys perfused with either a leukocyte-depleted packed red blood cell (PRBC) or a whole blood (WB) perfusate during a three-hour EVNP. RESULTS: After a mean cold ischemia time (CIT) of 54 hours, all kidneys showed high renal blood flow (RBF) through perfusion. Renal resistance (RR) increased for both groups during the first hour and then decreased to similar terminal values. The kidneys perfused with PRBC had 55 ml/min greater RBF (95% CI of 21 to 89; P=0.004) and higher total urine output (UO) (145 vs 25 ml, P= 0.002) compared to the WB group. Urinary acute kidney biomarkers of NGAL and KIM-1 were also significantly lower (mean differences of 281 and 2.1 ng/ml respectively; P<0.01) in the PRBC perfused kidneys. Compared to PRBC, within group tissue metabolic profiling revealed a similar (23% vs 18%) but a more pronounced alteration involving (branched chain) amino acid and mitochondrial energy metabolism in the WB group. Similarly, lipid profile temporal changes showed WB group were highlighted by elevation of plasma membrane and structure lipids including glycerolipids, sphingolipids, and steroids. The PRBC group had minimal temporal tissue lipid profile changes. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to WB, PRBC perfusion is superior in mitigating post-ischemia damage and facilitating function and metabolic recovery of high-risk kidneys subjected to long CITs during a three-hour EVNP.",

    "abstract": "Kidney complications can occur due to infective endocarditis, one of which is glomerulonephritis. Most often, an immune complex or complement-mediated glomerulonephritis is seen on kidney biopsy. In a minor subset of cases, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis may be present. Most often, such patients will demonstrate the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) on serologic testing. A growing number of cases of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis due to Bartonella endocarditis have been reported. This type of endocarditis can present diagnostic difficulties given that these patients are often culture negative. Herein, we report a challenging case of ANCA-negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis showing florid crescents on biopsy that was associated with Bartonella endocarditis.",

    "abstract": "Managing patients with kidney allografts largely depends on biopsy diagnosis which is based on semiquantitative assessments of rejection features and extent of acute and chronic changes within the renal parenchyma. Current methods lack reproducibility while digital image data-driven computational models enable comprehensive and quantitative assays. In this study we aimed to develop a computational method for automated assessment of histopathology transformations within the tubulointerstitial compartment of the renal cortex. Whole slide images of modified Picrosirius red-stained biopsy slides were used for the training (n = 852) and both internal (n = 172) and external (n = 94) tests datasets. The pipeline utilizes deep learning segmentations of renal tubules, interstitium, and peritubular capillaries from which morphometry features were extracted. Seven indicators were selected for exploring the intrinsic spatial interactions within the tubulointerstitial compartment. A principal component analysis revealed two independent factors which can be interpreted as representing chronic and acute tubulointerstitial injury. A K-means clustering classified biopsies according to potential phenotypes of combined acute and chronic transformations of various degrees. We conclude that multivariate analyses of tubulointerstitial morphometry transformations enable extraction of and quantification of acute and chronic components of injury. The method is developed for renal allograft biopsies; however, the principle can be applied more broadly for kidney pathology assessment.",

    "abstract": "The phytochrome superfamily comprises three groups of photoreceptors sharing a conserved GAF (cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases, cyanobacterial adenylate cyclases, and formate hydrogen lyase transcription activator FhlA) domain that uses a covalently attached linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore to sense light. Knotted red/far-red phytochromes are widespread in both bacteria and eukaryotes, but cyanobacteria also contain knotless red/far-red phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs). Unlike typical phytochromes, CBCRs require only the GAF domain for bilin binding, chromophore ligation, and full, reversible photoconversion. CBCRs can sense a wide range of wavelengths (ca. 330-750 nm) and can regulate phototaxis, second messenger metabolism, and optimization of the cyanobacterial light-harvesting apparatus. However, the origins of CBCRs are not well understood: we do not know when or why CBCRs evolved, or what selective advantages led to retention of early CBCRs in cyanobacterial genomes. In the current work, we use the increasing availability of genomes and metagenome-assembled-genomes from early-branching cyanobacteria to explore the origins of CBCRs. We reaffirm the earliest branches in CBCR evolution. We also show that early-branching cyanobacteria contain late-branching CBCRs, implicating early appearance of CBCRs during cyanobacterial evolution. Moreover, we show that early-branching CBCRs behave as integrators of light and pH, providing a potential unique function for early CBCRs that led to their retention and subsequent diversification. Our results thus provide new insight into the origins of these diverse cyanobacterial photoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "Widespread phytochrome photoreceptors use photoisomerization of linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophores to measure the ratio of red to far-red light. Cyanobacteria also contain distantly related cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) proteins that share the bilin-binding GAF domain of phytochromes but sense other colors of light. CBCR photocycles are extremely diverse, ranging from the near-UV to the near-IR. Photoisomerization of the bilin triggers photoconversion of the CBCR input, thereby modulating the biochemical signaling state of output domains such as histidine kinase bidomains that can interface with cellular signal transduction pathways. CBCRs thus can regulate several aspects of cyanobacterial photobiology, including phototaxis, metabolism of cyclic nucleotide second messengers, and optimization of the cyanobacterial light-harvesting apparatus. This review examines spectral tuning, photoconversion, and photobiology of CBCRs and recent developments in understanding their evolution and in applying them in synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptors in the phytochrome superfamily use 15,16-photoisomerization of a linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore to photoconvert between two states with distinct spectral and biochemical properties. Canonical phytochromes include master regulators of plant growth and development in which light signals trigger interconversion between a red-absorbing 15Z dark-adapted state and a metastable, far-red-absorbing 15E photoproduct state. Distantly related cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) carry out a diverse range of photoregulatory functions in cyanobacteria and exhibit considerable spectral diversity. One widespread CBCR subfamily typically exhibits a red-absorbing 15Z dark-adapted state similar to that of phytochrome that gives rise to a distinct green-absorbing 15E photoproduct. This red/green CBCR subfamily also includes red-inactive examples that fail to undergo photoconversion, providing an opportunity to study protein-chromophore interactions that either promote photoisomerization or block it. In this work, we identified a conserved lineage of red-inactive CBCRs. This enabled us to identify three substitutions sufficient to block photoisomerization in photoactive red/green CBCRs. The resulting red-inactive variants faithfully replicated the fluorescence and circular dichroism properties of naturally occurring examples. Converse substitutions restored photoconversion in naturally red-inactive CBCRs. This work thus identifies protein-chromophore interactions that control the fate of the excited-state population in red/green cyanobacteriochromes.",

    "abstract": "Biosyntheses of chlorophyll and heme in oxygenic phototrophs share a common trunk pathway that diverges with insertion of magnesium or iron into the last common intermediate, protoporphyrin IX. Since both tetrapyrroles are pro-oxidants, it is essential that their metabolism is tightly regulated. Here, we establish that heme-derived linear tetrapyrroles (bilins) function to stimulate the enzymatic activity of magnesium chelatase (MgCh) via their interaction with GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii A key tetrapyrrole-binding component of MgCh found in all oxygenic photosynthetic species, CrGUN4, also stabilizes the bilin-dependent accumulation of protoporphyrin IX-binding CrCHLH1 subunit of MgCh in light-grown C. reinhardtii cells by preventing its photooxidative inactivation. Exogenous application of biliverdin IXα reverses the loss of CrCHLH1 in the bilin-deficient heme oxygenase (hmox1) mutant, but not in the gun4 mutant. We propose that these dual regulatory roles of GUN4:bilin complexes are responsible for the retention of bilin biosynthesis in all photosynthetic eukaryotes, which sustains chlorophyll biosynthesis in an illuminated oxic environment.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are small, linear tetrapyrrole (bilin)-binding photoreceptors in the phytochrome superfamily that regulate diverse light-mediated adaptive processes in cyanobacteria. More spectrally diverse than canonical red/far-red-sensing phytochromes, CBCRs were thought to be restricted to sensing visible and near UV light until recently when several subfamilies with far-red-sensing representatives (frCBCRs) were discovered. Two of these frCBCRs subfamilies have been shown to incorporate bilin precursors with larger pi-conjugated chromophores, while the third frCBCR subfamily uses the same phycocyanobilin precursor found in the bulk of the known CBCRs. To elucidate the molecular basis of far-red light perception by this third frCBCR subfamily, we determined the crystal structure of the far-red-absorbing dark state of one such frCBCR Anacy_2551g3 from Anabaena cylindrica PCC 7122 which exhibits a reversible far-red/orange photocycle. Determined by room temperature serial crystallography and cryocrystallography, the refined 2.7-Å structure reveals an unusual all-Z,syn configuration of the phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore that is considerably less extended than those of previously characterized red-light sensors in the phytochrome superfamily. Based on structural and spectroscopic comparisons with other bilin-binding proteins together with site-directed mutagenesis data, our studies reveal protein-chromophore interactions that are critical for the atypical bathochromic shift. Based on these analyses, we propose that far-red absorption in Anacy_2551g3 is the result of the additive effect of two distinct red-shift mechanisms involving cationic bilin lactim tautomers stabilized by a constrained all-Z,syn conformation and specific interactions with a highly conserved anionic residue.",

This digitizer is designed to address the recently highlighted characteristics of BGO, which generates both scintillation and prompt Cerenkov photons when a 511 keV photon interacts with BGO. The developed digitizer independently processes these two types of photons for precise energy and timing measurements. The digitizer incorporates a noise-resistant binary counter that measures energy signals using the time-over-threshold (TOT) method. For timing measurements, we employ an embedded dual-side monitoring time-to-digital converter, which efficiently captures timing information while maintaining low resource usage. We validated the efficacy of our FPGA-based TOF digitizer through extensive experiments, including both electrical testing and coincidence measurements using BGO pixels. Our evaluations of TOT energy and timing performance utilized two 3 × 3 × 20 mm3BGO pixels coupled to CHK-HD MT silicon photomultipliers. The digitizer achieved a coincidence timing resolution (CTR) of 407 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) for events within the full width at tenth maximum of the photopeak in the measured TOT energy spectrum. Notably, when measured with an oscilloscope, the same detector pair exhibited a CTR of 403 ps FWHM, confirming that the performance of the developed digitizer is comparable to that of an oscilloscope. With its low resource usage, our design offers significant potential for scalability, making it particularly promising for multi-channel BGO-based PET systems.",

    "abstract": "We propose an FPGA-based Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) that utilizes a Virtual Bin (VB) approach with opposite-transition (OT) inputs on two Tapped-Delay Lines (TDLs) to obtain less-correlated time bins. The VBs from the proposed OT TDC were obtained by comparing and segmenting the less-correlated bins collected from the two TDLs. The OT TDC was implemented on a 7-series FPGA (Xilinx) to verify performance. A conventional monotonic-transition (MT) TDC, which used identical transition inputs (0-to-1 or 1-to-0 transition) for the two TDLs, was also implemented as a control group. The results were compared with those from the MT TDC and other studies. The proposed method effectively improves time resolution and integral linearity while keeping resource usage low by exploiting these characteristics. The average bin size and RMS value were 5.5 and 4.2 ps, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits stable performance under temperature variations and implementation location changes. The VB OT TDC, which applies the VB method to the OT TDC, successfully measures detection time differences of two signals from two Cerenkov radiator integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (CRI-MCP-PMTs) with a high timing precision of sub-100 ps. The VB OT TDC can be used for next-generation applications that require fast-timing measurements.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive biomedical imaging modality for noninvasively detecting and visualizing positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals within a subject. In PET, measuring the time-of-flight (TOF) information for each pair of 511 keV annihilation photons improves effective sensitivity but requires high timing resolution. Hybrid materials that emit both scintillation and Cherenkov photons, such as bismuth germanate, recently offer the potential for more precise timing information from Cherenkov photons while maintaining adequate energy resolution from scintillation photons. However, a significant challenge in using such hybrid materials for TOF PET applications lies in the event-dependent timing spread caused by the mixed detection of Cherenkov and scintillation photons due to relatively lower production of Cherenkov photons. This study introduces an innovative approach by segmenting silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels coupled to a single crystal, rather than using traditional SiPMs that are as large as or larger than the crystals they read. We demonstrated that multiple timestamps and photon counts obtained from the segmented SiPM can classify events by providing temporal photon density, effectively addressing this challenge. The approach and findings would lead to new opportunities in applications that require precise timing and photon counting.",

    "abstract": "This is an explanatory paper on Sun Il Kwon et al., Nat. Photon. 15: 914-918, 2021 and some parts of this manuscript are translated from the paper. Medical imaging modalities such as X-ray computed tomography, Magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography, require image reconstruction processes, consequently constraining them to form cylindrical shapes. However, among them, only PET can use additional information, so called time of flight, on an event-by-event basis. If coincidence time resolution (CTR) of PET detectors improved to 30 ps, which corresponds to spatial resolution of 4.5 mm, directly localizing electron-positron annihilation point is possible, allowing us to circumvent image reconstruction processes and free us from the geometric constraint. We call this concept direct positron emission imaging (dPEI). We have developed ultrafast radiation detectors by focusing on Cherenkov photon detection. Furthermore, the CTR of 32 ps being equivalent to 4.8 mm spatial resolution is achieved by combining deep learning-based signal processing with the detectors. In this article, we explain how we developed the detectors and demonstrated the first dPEI using different types of phantoms, how we will tackle limitations to be addressed to make the dPEI more practical, and how dPEI will emerge as an imaging modality in nuclear medicine.",

An affirmative answer to this question was previously claimed by Czech-Dong. We point out an error in their proof when the bulk is multiply connected. We nonetheless find strong support, of two kinds, for an affirmative answer in that case. We extend the Czech-Dong proof for simply-connected spacetimes to spacetimes with π1 = ℤ (i.e. 2-boundary, genus-0 wormholes). Specializing to vacuum solutions, we also numerically test thousands of distinct inequalities (including all known RT inequalities for up to 6 regions) on millions of randomly chosen configurations of regions and bulk spacetimes, including three different multiply-connected topologies; we find no counterexamples. In an appendix, we prove some (dimension-independent) facts about degenerate HRT surfaces and symmetry breaking. A video abstract is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ols92YU8rus.",

This allows us to recast cumbersome entropic expressions into much simpler ones which share interestingly rigid structures. By performing a systematic search over some of these structures, we are able to discover more than 1800 novel entropy inequalities for six parties, thereby demonstrating that these recastings provide a fruitful generating technique for uncovering new holographic entropy inequalities. In attempting to interpret the corresponding sign-definite quantities as correlation measures, we also obtain a no-go result: the superbalance property of holographic entropy inequalities turns out to preclude them from being monotonic under partial tracing. In the process, we also comment on the geometrical significance of multipartite information quantities and present various structural relations amongst them.",

    "abstract": "We derive several new reformulations of the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi covariant holographic entanglement entropy formula. These include: (1) a minimax formula, which involves finding a maximal-area achronal surface on a timelike hypersurface homologous to D(A) (the boundary causal domain of the region A whose entropy we are calculating) and minimizing over the hypersurface; (2) a max V-flow formula, in which we maximize the flux through D(A) of a divergenceless bulk 1-form V subject to an upper bound on its norm that is non-local in time; and (3) a min U-flow formula, in which we minimize the flux over a bulk Cauchy slice of a divergenceless timelike 1-form U subject to a lower bound on its norm that is non-local in space. The two flow formulas define convex programs and are related to each other by Lagrange duality. For each program, the optimal configurations dynamically find the HRT surface and the entanglement wedges of A and its complement. The V-flow formula is the covariant version of the Freedman-Headrick bit thread reformulation of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We also introduce a measure-theoretic concept of a “thread distribution”, and explain how Riemannian flows, V-flows, and U-flows can be expressed in terms of thread distributions.",

    "abstract": "High-performance heat exchangers are essential components in applications related to aerospace, industrial processes, and power generation. In power generation, the primary heat exchangers (HX) in future supercritical fluid Brayton cycles need to operate at temperatures in excess of 700 °C and pressures of 200 bar, necessitating the need for novel designs, high-temperature alloys, and new manufacturing methods to develop compact and high efficiency components. In this work, the design, fabrication, and experimental characterization of an additively manufactured (AM) primary HX for chloride molten salt (MS) to supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) is presented. The primary HX can also be used for extracting heat from a high temperature waste heat stream to sCO2. The primary HX is fabricated with Haynes 282 alloy via laser powder bed fusion AM. The core of the primary HX is comprised of a pin array on the sCO2 side and a three-dimensional periodic lattice network on the hot side. The sCO2 headers are aerodynamic in shape and are integrated within the MS flow path to permit scalability of the primary HX and permit a near counter-flow exchange of heat. A 20-pair primary HX is experimentally characterized using 200 bar sCO2 on the cold side and heated air as a surrogate for chloride MS on the hot side. Experimental results are used to validate a core thermofluidic model for the primary HX. The model predicts heat transfer rate and exit temperature of the air and sCO2 streams, on average, to within 1.72 %, 0.75 %, and 1.46 %, respectively. The validated model is used to estimate the volumetric and gravimetric power density of the MS-sCO2 heat exchanger, and the impact of varying inlet temperatures and flow rates of both streams on the primary HX performance. Considerations for AM fabrication and assembly of a modular 1 MW unit are provided.",

    "abstract": "Design of an additively manufactured molten salt (MS) to supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) primary heat exchanger (PHE) for solar thermal power generation is presented. The PHE is designed to handle temperatures up to 720°C on the MS side and an internal pressure of 200 bar on the sCO2 side. In the core, MS flows through a three-dimensional periodic lattice network, while sCO2 flows within pin arrays. The design includes integrated sCO2 headers located within the MS flow, allowing for a counterflow design of the PHE. The sCO2 headers are configured to enable uniform flow distribution into each sCO2 plate while withstanding an internal pressure of 200 bar and minimizing obstruction to the flow of MS around it. The structural integrity of the design is verified on additively manufactured (AM) 316 stainless steel sub-scale specimens. An experimentally validated, correlation- based sectional PHE core thermofluidic model is developed to study the impact of flow and geometrical parameters on the PHE performance, with varied parameters including the mass flowrate, surface roughness, and PHE dimensions. A process-based cost model is used to determine the impact of parameter variation on build cost. The model results show that a heat exchanger with a power density of 18.6 MW/m3 (including sCO2 header volume) and effectiveness of 0.88 can be achieved at a heat capacity rate ratio of 0.8. The impact of design and AM machine parameters on the cost of the PHE are assessed.",

    "abstract": "Passive two-phase fluid cooling systems are of interest for cooling electronics in terrestrial and micro gravity environments due to their compactness and elimination of moving parts. In this paper, the use of asymmetry for the bubble ebullition and growth on a heated surface to passively generate lateral motion of fluid within an open-ended channel is discussed. The asymmetry is affected by locating reentrant slot cavities on one face of a mm-scale 30/60-degree ratchet. Two such ratcheted walls with cavities in every third ratchet form the vertical walls of an open-ended channel. The ratcheted walls are heated using a serpentine thick-film metallic heater and the open-ended channel is located within a quiescent pool of a dielectric fluid. Visualization studies show that bubbles and slugs tend to move in a preferential direction within the open channel. This direction corresponds to the 30-degree slope face of the ratchet, in which the reentrant cavity is located. Prior studies have alluded to two potential mechanisms for this preferential lateral motion-(1) bubble pump model developed by Kapsenberg et al. [1], which attributes the lateral motion to the momentum imparted by the growing bubble to the surrounding liquid, and (2) asymmetry in the curvature of the slug that spans several ratchet lengths, resulting in a net surface tension force along the 30-degree slope of the ratchet [2]. In order to assess the importance of the bubble pump model, bubble ebullition and growth from the nucleation sites are captured using high speed videos and are analyzed using custom image processing. The velocity imparted by the growing bubble on the ratchet to the surrounding liquid is calculated using the semi-empirical model of Kapsenberg et al [1]. This predicted velocity is compared against velocities of detached Stokes bubbles in the field of view obtained using bubble tracking velocimetry.",

    "abstract": "Advances in manufacturing technologies and materials are crucial to the commercial deployment of energy technologies. We present the case of concentrating solar power (CSP) with molten salt (MS) thermal storage, where low-cost, high-efficiency heat exchangers (HXs) are needed to achieve cost competitiveness. The materials required to tolerate the extreme operating conditions in CSP systems make it difficult or infeasible to produce them using conventional manufacturing processes. Although it is technically possible to produce HXs with adequate performance using additive manufacturing, specifically laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), here we assess whether doing so is cost-effective. We describe a process-based cost model (PBCM) to estimate the cost of fabricating a MS-to-supercritical carbon dioxide HX using LPBF. The PBCM is designed to identify modifications to designs, process choices, and manufacturing innovations that have the greatest effect on manufacturing cost. Our PBCM identified HX design and LPBF process modifications that reduced projected HX cost from $750 per kilo-Watt thermal (kW-th) ($8/cm3) to $350/kW-th ($6/cm3) using currently available LPBF technology, and down to $220/kW-th ($4/cm3) with improvements in LPBF technology that are likely to be achieved in the near term. The PBCM also informed a redesign of the HX design that reduced projected costs to $140-160/kW-th ($3/cm3).",

    "issued": "2024-05",
    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has tremendous potential to produce high-power-density heat exchangers. However, manufacturing AM-heat exchangers at a competitive cost impedes their commercial adoption. In this paper, a novel design of an AM counter flow pin–fin compact recuperator, and its manufacturing costs when using laser powder bed fusion method, are presented. The compact recuperator, which can operate at a high temperature of 800 °C, a high fluid pressure (250 bar) on the cold side and withstand a differential pressure of 170 bars across the fluid streams, as seen in supercritical carbon dioxide power cycles, is designed for a lifetime of 40,000 h. Numerical models to predict the thermo-fluidic performance, and a simplified mechanical model based on plate theory to predict the mechanical stresses, of the recuperator are presented. The recuperator's thermal performance and compactness are studied, and its manufacturability is evaluated via a multi-objective techno-economic optimization. The optimization process considers thermo-fluidic, structural, and manufacturing constraints. The recuperator was fabricated using Haynes 282, and the printability of the design features using a laser-powder-bed-fusion machine is demonstrated. The choice of employing two different AM machines, with different build plate dimensions, number of lasers, and design constraints, on the recuperator's cost/unit, cost/UA, and cost/kW-th o are examined. It is observed that the cost/UA and cost/kW-th decrease exponentially from 13,839 USD-K/kW to 1,994 USD-K/kW and from 80 USD/kW-th to 18 USD/kW-th, respectively, with the size and thermal rating of the recuperator. The exponential decrease in cost/UA and cost/kW-th with increase in power rating opens the possibility of manufacturing large-scale additively manufactured recuperators at a competitive cost. The recuperator, including headers, can achieve a maximum volumetric heat density of 200 MW/m3. The optimization framework can be used to obtain optimal pin-array heat exchanger dimensions for other applications and materials using laser powder bed fusion method.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis (JIS) outcomes with brace treatment are limited with poorly described bracing protocols. Between 49 and 100% of children with JIS will progress to surgery, however, young age, long follow-up, and varying treatment methods make studying this population difficult. The purpose of this study is to report the outcomes of bracing in JIS treated with a Boston brace™ and identify risk factors for progression and surgical intervention. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective review of 175 patients with JIS who initiated brace treatment between the age of 4 and 9 years. A cohort of 140 children reached skeletal maturity; 91 children had surgery or at least 2 year follow-up after brace completion. Standard in-brace protocol for scoliosis 320° was a Boston brace for 18-20 h/day after MRI (n = 82). Family history, MRI abnormalities, comorbidities, curve type, curve magnitude, bracing duration, number of braces, compliance by report, and surgical interventions were recorded. RESULTS: Children were average 7.9 years old (range 4.1-9.8) at the initiation of bracing. The Boston brace™ was prescribed in 82 patients and nine used night bending brace. Mid-thoracic curves (53%) was the most frequent deformity. Maximum curve at presentation was on average 30 ± 9 degrees, in-brace curve angle was 16 ± 8 degrees, and in-brace correction was 58 ± 24 percent. Patients were braced an average of 4.6 ± 1.9 years. 61/91 (67%) went on to posterior spinal fusion at 13.3 ± 2.1 (range 9.3-20.9) years and curve magnitude of 61 ± 12 degrees. Of those that underwent surgery, 49/55 (86%) progressed > 10°, 6/55 (11%) stabilized within 10°, and 0/55 (0%) improved > 10° with brace wear. No children underwent growth-friendly posterior instrumentation. Of the 28 who did not have surgical correction, 3 (11%) progressed > 10°, 13/28 (46%) stabilized within 10°, and 12/28 (43%) improved > 10° with brace wear. CONCLUSIONS: This large series of JIS patients with bracing followed to skeletal maturity with long-term follow-up. Surgery was avoided in 33% of children with minimal to no progression, and no child underwent posterior growth-friendly constructs. Risk factors of needing surgery were noncompliance and larger curves at presentation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in childhood. Scoliosis is a common complication of CP that can reach clinically severe levels, but predictors for scoliosis in CP are not well understood. Some variables identified in the literature involve the severity of the brain injury and the presence of hip deformity. We aimed to identify associations with developing severe scoliosis in a prospective cohort of patients with cerebral palsy at higher risk for severe curve progression. METHODS: This study reviewed a prospectively collected database at a tertiary children's hospital. We evaluated a panel of potential associations with severe scoliosis-including age, sex, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) class, history of hip surgery, epilepsy, and feeding tube presence-in a population of children with limited ambulatory ability defined as GMFCS level IV or V CP. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression with stepwise selection was used for analysis. RESULTS: Descriptive analysis showed that female sex, higher GMFCS class, history of hip surgery, non-upright seating, pelvic obliquity, presence of epilepsy, and presence of a feeding tube were associated with an increased risk for scoliosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of a feeding tube was associated with severe scoliosis even when controlling for GMFCS and age. CONCLUSIONS: Feeding tube use may stratify risk for severe scoliosis progression in patients with GMFCS IV or V CP.",

    "abstract": "Depression and alcohol use are highly comorbid, and often emerge during adolescence. Depressive symptoms may precede alcohol use, via the self-medication pathway, or alcohol use may precede depressive symptoms, via the alcohol induced disruption pathway. Yet little is known about other risks for developing comorbidity via either path. The present study hypothesized that poor cognitive and physiological emotion regulation (ER) are risk factors implicated in the development of comorbid depression and alcohol use during late adolescence. Participants were 229 (113 girls) Mexican-origin youth who reported on depressive symptoms and alcohol use at ages 17 (Time 1) and 19 years (Time 2). At age 17, cognitive reappraisal (CR), an adaptive ER strategy, and baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a physiological index of ER capacity, were assessed. CR, RSA and gender were examined as predictors and moderators of the developing comorbidity of alcohol use and depression in cross-lagged panel models. Lower use of CR was concurrently associated with more depressive symptoms at age 17 and predicted greater depression at age 19. Age 17 alcohol use predicted age 19 depressive symptoms for boys. Lower RSA at age 17 also predicted more depressive symptoms at age 19 for boys. Neither CR nor RSA moderated the predicted relations between depression and alcohol use. Findings supported the alcohol induced disruption model of comorbidity for boys, and showed that poor cognitive and physiological ER increased risk for exacerbating depressive symptoms in late adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a period of normative heightened sensitivity to peer influence. Individual differences in susceptibility to peers is related to individual differences in neural sensitivity, particularly in brain regions that support an increasingly greater orientation toward peers. Despite these empirically-established patterns, the more specific psychosocial and socio-cognitive factors associated with individual differences in neural sensitivity to peer influence are just beginning to gain research attention. Specific features of the factors that contribute to how adolescents process social information can inform understanding of the psychological and neurobiological processes involved in what renders adolescents to be more or less susceptible to peer influences. In this paper, we (1) review the literature about peer, family, and broader contextual influences on sensitivity to peers' positive and negative behaviors, (2) outline components of social information processing theories, and (3) discuss features of these models from the perspectives and social cognitive development and social neuroscience. We identify gaps in the current literature that need to be addressed in order to gain a more comprehensive view of adolescent neural sensitivity to peer influence. We conclude by suggesting how future neuroimaging studies can adopt components of this social information processing model to generate new lines of research.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize the role of sex and pubertal markers in reward motivation behavior and neural processing in early adolescence. We used baseline and two-year follow-up data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive DevelopmentSM study (15844 observations; 52% from boys; age 9-13). Pubertal development was measured with parent-reported Pubertal Development Scale, and DHEA, testosterone, and estradiol levels. Reward motivation behavior and neural processing at anticipation and feedback stages were assessed with the Monetary Incentive Delay task. Boys had higher reward motivation than girls, demonstrating greater accuracy difference between reward and neutral trials and higher task earnings. Girls had lower neural activation during reward feedback than boys in the nucleus accumbens, caudate, rostral anterior cingulate, medial orbitofrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate. Pubertal stage and testosterone levels were positively associated with reward motivation behavior, although these associations changed when controlling for age. There were no significant associations between pubertal development and neural activation during reward anticipation and feedback. Sex differences in reward-related processing exist in early adolescence, signaling the need to understand their impact on typical and atypical functioning as it unfolds into adulthood.",

    "issued": "2024-03",
    "abstract": "Loneliness becomes more prevalent as youth transition from childhood into adolescence. A key underlying process may be the puberty-related increase in biological stress reactivity, which can alter social behavior and elicit conflict or social withdrawal (\"fight-or-flight\" behaviors) in some youth, but increased prosocial (\"tend-and-befriend\") responses in others. We propose an integrative theoretical model that identifies the social, personality, and biological characteristics underlying individual differences in social-behavioral responses to stress. This model posits a vicious cycle whereby youth who respond to stress with \"fight-or-flight\" tendencies develop increasing and chronic levels of loneliness across adolescence, whereas youth who display \"tend-and-befriend\" behaviors may be buffered from these consequences. Based on research supporting this model, we propose multiple intervention avenues for curtailing the prevalence of loneliness in adolescence by targeting key factors involved in its development: social relationships, personality, and stress-induced behavioral and biological changes.",

In their review, Gupta, Eckstrand, and Forbes (Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2024) present an empirically-based conceptual neurodevelopmental model of anhedonia whereby brain development and pubertal maturation create openness to vulnerability to anhedonia that is influenced by early life adversity and chronic inflammation. This commentary considers anhedonia as a paradox of adolescence given its juxtaposition to the expected developmental milestones of adolescence. It highlights the need to consider anhedonia in terms of both variability and universality of children's experiences and biological development, missed opportunities for social relationships and experiences, and forms and functions of rewards and anhedonia.",

    "issued": "2025-02",
    "abstract": "In every heartbeat, cardiac muscle cells perform excitation-Ca2+ signaling-contraction (EC) coupling to pump blood against the vascular resistance. Cardiomyocytes can sense the mechanical load and activate mechano-chemo-transduction (MCT) mechanism, which provides feedback regulation of EC coupling. MCT feedback is important for the heart to upregulate contraction in response to increased load to maintain cardiac output. MCT feedback enhances the L-type Ca2+ current, sensitizes ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and augments SERCA pump activity, thereby maintaining contraction amplitude despite increased load. However, under certain conditions, MCT feedback can also promote cardiac alternans, seen as beat-to-beat variations in action potential duration, Ca2+ transients, and contraction strength, which is a precursor to arrhythmias. While alternans can arise from instabilities in either membrane voltage or intracellular Ca2+ cycling, underlying mechanisms of MCT-induced alternans, particularly electromechanically discordant alternans where stronger beats are paradoxically associated with shorter action potentials, remain unclear. In this study, we used a mathematical model of the ventricular myocyte to investigate the effects of MCT feedback on the dynamical system that generates alternans. We systematically analyzed how MCT feedback, acting through L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs), RyRs, or SERCA, affects the stability of membrane voltage and Ca2+ cycling, as well as the coupling between them. Our results show that MCT feedback can generally promote both concordant and discordant alternans in action potential and Ca2+ transients, depending on the underlying instability mechanism. We found that MCT feedback through RyRs predominantly increases Ca2+ instability, while LTCC and SERCA feedback have complex effects due to the interplay between stability and coupling alterations. We also showed how to determine underlying mechanisms from experimental and clinical observations. Our modeling studies provide new insights into the complex dynamics underlying cardiac alternans and highlight the importance of MCT feedback in the development of life-threatening arrhythmias in the heart under mechanical load.",

    "abstract": "Increased beat-to-beat QT interval variability (QTV) in the electrocardiogram is strongly associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, yet its origins remain poorly understood. While heart rate variability decreases with deteriorating cardiac health, QTV increases, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. The stochastic nature of ion channel gating is a potential source of cardiac variability. However, the law of large numbers suggests that, with billions of channels in the heart, this stochasticity should be minimized. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that dynamical instability amplifies stochastic ion channel fluctuations, leading to increased action potential (AP) variability. Using a mathematical model of ventricular myocytes, we investigated the relationship between AP variability and voltage instability. Our results demonstrate that stochastic gating alone cannot cause large AP variability, but dynamical instability significantly amplifies this variability. We found a positive correlation between voltage instability, indicated by the slope of the AP duration restitution curve, and AP duration variability. Notably, the largest variability occurred at the onset of alternans when considering every other beat. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for increased QTV in pathological conditions and suggest that measuring QTV using every other beat may predict the onset of alternans and severity of alternans. Our study highlights the critical role of dynamical instability in cardiac electrical variability and offers new insights into the mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: A recent study by Kawatou et al . has shown that the local heterogeneity of ion channel conductance is a critical substrate for focal or reentrant arrhythmias. However, the role of fibroblasts with repolarization heterogeneity in the initiation and maintenance of arrhythmias remains unknown. In this study, we investigated how diffuse fibrosis contributes to the formation of focal and reentrant arrhythmias under drug-induced heterogeneity using physiologically detailed mathematical models of the human heart. To simulate drug-induced heterogeneity, we varied the maximum conductance of transmembrane potassium and calcium currents, leading to heterogeneity in action potential duration (APD). Then, we assessed the effects of different fibrosis densities (FD) on the occurrence of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). Fibroblasts were randomly and evenly inserted into the tissue, and various FD levels ranging from 0 to 35% were examined. We found a biphasic relationship between FD and drug-induced PVCs. Within a certain range of FD, FD positively correlated with PVC susceptibility. However, excessively high fibrosis levels were associated with reduced susceptibility to PVCs. In addition, the self-sustainability of arrhythmias exhibited a positive correlation with FD. This study demonstrates the interplay between the diffuse fibrosis and the drug-induced heterogeneity of APD in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias. AUTHOR SUMMARY: Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Understanding the mechanisms underlying arrhythmia and its precursors is critical for the development of effective therapies and drugs. Repolarization heterogeneity plays a crucial role in both the initiation and maintenance of arrhythmias. Fibroblasts constitute a vital component of cardiac structure, originating from the remodeling of ventricular wall cells or the transformation of injured myocardial cells. Fibroblasts are known to couple with and alter the electrical properties of myocardial cells. However, our understanding of the role of fibroblasts in the development of arrhythmia remains limited. In this study, we employed a physiologically detailed mathematical model of cardiac tissue to investigate the roles of drug-induced heterogeneity and diffuse fibrosis in the initiation and maintenance of arrhythmias. We used 2D and 3D computational models to simulate various levels of drug-induced heterogeneity conditions with normal to pathological levels of fibroblast density (FD). We found that within a certain range of FD, fibroblasts promote PVCs under drug-induced heterogeneity. However, if FD exceeds 30%, the occurrence of PVCs decreases (biphasic relationship). On the other hand, the self-sustainability of VF (ventricular fibrillation) consistently increases with FD. This study implies that fibroblasts in cardiac tissue may play different roles in the initiation and maintenance of arrhythmia.",

    "abstract": "The heart has intrinsic abilities to autoregulate contractile force in response to mechanical load. Recent experimental studies show that cardiomyocytes have mechano-chemo-transduction (MCT) mechanisms that form a closed feedback loop in the excitation-Ca2+ signaling-contraction (E-C) coupling. This closed feedback loop enables autoregulation of contraction in response to mechanical load changes. Here, we develop the first autoregulatory E-C coupling model that couples electrophysiology, Ca2+ signaling, force development and contraction, and MCT feedback. The model recapitulates the experimental data showing that the mechanical load on cardiomyocytes during contraction increases the L-type Ca2+ current, action potential duration, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content, and SR Ca2+ release, giving rise to increased cytosolic Ca2+ transient (MCT-Ca2+ gain) and enhanced contraction. The model also makes non-trivial predictions on the autoregulation of contraction with moderate MCT-Ca2+ gain under a range of physiological load changes, but arrhythmogenic discordant alternans with excessive MCT-Ca2+ gain under pathological overload.",

    "abstract": "Structural heterogeneity in the distribution of ryanodine receptor (RyR) clusters in cardiac myocytes has been shown to have pro-arrhythmic effects. The presence of a mixture of large and small RyR clusters can potentiate arrhythmogenic calcium (Ca2+) waves. RyRs are subject to posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, that are linked to heart failure and other pathological conditions. This study aims to investigate how PTMs interact with the structural heterogeneity of RyR clusters and further increase heterogeneous Ca2+ release activities in cardiac myocytes. Using a physiologically detailed three-dimensional ventricular myocyte model containing approximately 2 million stochastic RyR channels, we simulated heterogeneous distributions of RyR clusters with and without PTMs. The results demonstrate that Ca2+ cycling and RyR phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) create a positive feedback loop, which increases functional heterogeneity in the Ca2+ spark size distribution. In large clusters, the Ca2+ leak is substantial due to the large flux (number of channels recruited), leading to increased local Ca2+ concentrations, CaMKII activation, and further RyR sensitization, amplifying the leak. Conversely, in small clusters, the leak is limited, and sensitization is restricted. Furthermore, CaMKII activation can enhance late sodium (Na+) currents, increasing Na+ influx and subsequently raising Ca2+ levels via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, further promoting the Ca2+ leak and functional heterogeneity. We conclude that such positive feedback processes play a crucial role in arrhythmogenic Ca2+ wave initiation and propagation, particularly in heart failure myocytes, where PTMs are often dysregulated.",

OBJECTIVE: To describe antimicrobial prescriptions in periparturient does admitted to veterinary teaching hospitals and to determine if any factors were associated with the administration of antimicrobials in general or ceftiofur in particular. ANIMALS: One hundred ninety-eight periparturient does presented to nine university veterinary hospitals from October 2021 to June 2022. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study in a prospective design. Data were collected from questionnaire completed by admitting clinician. RESULTS: Out of 198 periparturient does included in the study, 153 (77%) received antimicrobials during hospitalization. Commonly administered antimicrobials included oxytetracycline (n = 44, 29%), ceftiofur sodium (n = 43, 28%), ceftiofur crystalline free acid (CCFA; n = 27, 18%), potassium penicillin G (n = 15, 10%), procaine penicillin G (n = 14, 9%), florfenicol (n = 14, 9%), tulathromycin (n = 9, 6%), ampicillin trihydrate (n = 4, 3%), and ampicillin sodium (n = 1, 1%). Cesarean section was associated with antimicrobial administration in general (OR = 5.89; 95% CI = 2.49-13.98, p < 0.01) and with ceftiofur administration (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.25-5.17; p = 0.008). Significant variability in ceftiofur administration by hospital was observed (p < 0.001).

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To document the type, signalment, associations and prevalence of skin disease in a referral hospital population. ANIMALS: Case population at a university veterinary medical teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study by searching computerised medical records of sheep examined between 1 January 1986 and 1 January 2021.

RESULTS: Two thousand and two records, totalling 11,799 sheep, had the age, breed and sex reported. Older sheep were more likely to present with skin disease (p < 0.0001; standard deviation 36.6 ± 1.15 confidence interval). The American Merino, East Friesian, Rambouillet, Suffolk and Shetland breeds were at higher risk of developing skin disease (p < 0.0001). Males, whether rams or wethers, were more likely to present with skin disease than ewes (p = 0.0019). Owing to the lack of dermatological examination reported, the four largest flocks (a total of 7,892 sheep) were excluded from disease analysis. Of the remaining 3,907 sheep, 299 (7.6%) had skin disease recorded. The most common diagnoses made were pododermatitis, bacterial abscesses, squamous cell carcinoma and myiasis. Fifty-five of 299 sheep were presented primarily for nonskin disease. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinicians should include a dermatological examination in sheep regardless of the reason for presentation.",

This study determined AMR gene presence in 326 respiratory isolates (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Histophilus somni) from weaned dairy heifers using whole genome sequencing. Concordance between AMR genotype and phenotype was determined. Twenty-six AMR genes for 8 broad classes of AMD were identified. The most prevalent, medically important AMD classes used in calf rearing, to which these genes predict AMR among study isolates were tetracycline (95%), aminoglycoside (94%), sulfonamide (94%), beta-lactam (77%), phenicol (50%), and macrolide (44%). The co-occurrence of AMR genes within an isolate was common; the largest cluster of gene co-occurrence encodes AMR to phenicol, macrolide, elfamycin, β-lactam (cephalosporin, penam cephamycin), aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and sulfonamide class AMD. Concordance between genotype and phenotype varied (Matthew's Correlation Coefficient ranged from -0.57 to 1) by bacterial species, gene, and AMD tested, and was particularly poor for fluoroquinolones (no AMR genes detected) and ceftiofur (no phenotypic AMR classified while AMR genes present). These findings suggest a high genetic potential for AMR in weaned dairy heifers; preventing BRD and decreasing AMD reliance may be important in this population.",

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most common cause of antimicrobial drug (AMD) use, morbidity, and mortality in this production group. The study of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is complicated because many variables that may affect AMR are related. This study generates hypotheses regarding the farm- and animal-level variables (e.g., vaccination, lane cleaning, and AMD use practices) that may be associated with AMR in respiratory isolates from weaned dairy heifers. A cross-sectional study was performed using survey data and respiratory isolates (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Histophilus somni) collected from 341 weaned dairy heifers on six farms in California. Logistic regression and Bayesian network analyses were used to evaluate the associations between farm- and animal-level variables with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classification of respiratory isolates against 11 AMDs. Farm-level variables associated with MIC classification of respiratory isolates included the number of source farms of a calf-rearing facility, whether the farm practiced onsite milking, the use of lagoon water for flush lane cleaning, and respiratory and pinkeye vaccination practices. Animal-level variables associated with a MIC classification included whether the calf was BRD-score-positive and time since the last phenicol treatment.",

A single-group pre-post quasi-experimental design was used. Sixty-eight parents completed ADHD knowledge/belief scales and stress inventories, and pre-ADHD and post-ADHD information workshop. Follow-up calls were made after the workshop to assess treatment utilization. Parents/caregivers experienced significant knowledge and belief changes regarding medication efficacy, willingness to accept physician treatment recommendations, and rejection of non-empirically based treatments. Follow-up data showed that 41% of contacted participants met with physicians to discuss medication utilization and behavioral treatments. Brief, one-session psycho-educational workshops were feasible and impacted parental beliefs and behaviors regarding scientifically supported interventions for ADHD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the utilization of conventional treatments and utilization of complementary and alternative medicine in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and other developmental disabilities (DD). METHODS: Participants were 578 children who were part of an ongoing population-based, case-control study of 2- to 5-year olds with ASD, DD, and the general population. Parents completed an interview on past and current services. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-three children with ASD and 125 DD children were included. ASD families received more hours of conventional services compared with DD families (17.8 vs 11; p < .001). The use of psychotropic medications was low in both groups (approximately 3%). Overall, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use was not significantly different in ASD (39%) versus DD (30%). Hispanic families in both groups used CAM less often than non-Hispanic families. Variables such as level of function, immunization status, and the presence of an identified neurogenetic disorder were not predictive of CAM use. A higher level of parental education was associated with an increased CAM use in ASD and DD. Families who used >20 hours per week of conventional services were more likely to use CAM, including potentially unsafe or disproven CAM. Underimmunized children were marginally more likely to use CAM but not more likely to have received potentially unsafe or disproven CAM. CONCLUSION: Use of CAM is common in families of young children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and it is predicted by higher parental education and non-Hispanic ethnicity but not developmental characteristics. Further research should address how health care providers can support families in making decisions about CAM use.",

    "abstract": "FMR1 premutation carriers are common in the general population (1/130-260 females and 1/250-810 males) and can be affected by fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome, fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency, anxiety, depression, hypertension, sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, and hypothyroidism. Here we report the results of a pilot study to assess the prevalence and risk of migraine in FMR1 premutation carriers. Three hundred fifteen carriers (203 females; 112 males) and 154 controls (83 females; 71 males) were seen sequentially as part of a family study. A standardized medical history, physical examination and confirmation of diagnosis of migraine headaches were performed by a physician. The prevalence of migraine was 54.2% in female carriers (mean age/SD: 49.60/13.73) and 26.79% in male carriers (mean age/SD: 59.94/14.27). This prevalence was higher compared to female (25.3%; mean age/SD: 47.60/15.21; p =  0.0001) and male controls (15.5%; mean age/SD; 53.88/13.31; p =  0.0406) who underwent the same protocol and were confirmed to be negative for the FMR1 mutation by DNA testing. We hypothesize that the increased prevalence of migraine headaches in FMR1 premutation carriers is likely related to the mitochondrial abnormalities that have recently been reported. Screening for migraine should be considered when evaluating FMR1 premutation carriers in the future.",

    "abstract": "The American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) is an invasive species globally significant for its role as a generalist predator in freshwater systems. Native turtles are among the species eaten by bullfrogs, and turtle populations are slow to recover from this impact. We examined the effects of bullfrogs and their removal on Northwestern pond turtles (Actinemys marmorata) at four sites in Yosemite National Park. From 2016 to 2022, we monitored turtle populations in two sites where bullfrogs were present and two where they have been absent. We removed 12,317 bullfrogs, larvae, and whole egg masses from one site and 4067 from the other, reaching near complete eradication by 2019. We captured just large adult turtles where bullfrogs were present compared with all sizes where bullfrogs were absent. Prior to near complete eradication, juvenile turtles were only found with bullfrogs when they were recovered from bullfrog stomachs. Turtles at bullfrog present sites were 26–36 % larger and 76–97 % heavier than turtles from bullfrog absent sites. Turtle abundance and densities were also 2–100 times higher at bullfrog absent sites. We captured the first juvenile turtles at bullfrog present sites only after reaching near complete bullfrog eradication in 2019. Altogether, our study shows a prolonged lack of juvenile turtle recruitment where bullfrogs were present but offers hope that bullfrog control may succeed in recovering turtle populations by easing predation pressure on hatchlings and juveniles. Our results indicate that bullfrog eradication efforts may be necessary to ensure persistence of at-risk species like native turtles.",

    "issued": "2024-01",
    "abstract": "Conservation translocations are often used to connect disjunct populations or reintroduce them to otherwise suitable areas from which they have become locally extinct. Translocations, however, can alter wildlife movements and increase their exposure to hazards such as predation, thus increasing their risk of mortality. The giant gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas, is a wetland-dependent threatened species that has lost > 90% of its historical habitat. Certain species recovery may depend on the success of translocations in restoring populations. We translocated snakes from two donor sites—one managed wetland and one rice agriculture site—to a third restored wetland in Sacramento County, California, USA, to evaluate the impact of translocations on home ranges and movements. Translocated snakes had smaller home ranges after translocation for the 95% and 100% MCP estimation, had smaller net displacements, but had similar measures of sinuosity (index that measures the curvature of a movement path), total distance moved, and start-to-end distance compared to their individual measurements before translocation. Landscape type, however, had the greatest effect on home range estimates and movement measures, with resident snakes from the rice agriculture site having greater home ranges and net displacements, and greater, less sinuous seasonal movement paths than snakes from both the donor and recipient wetland sites. Results varied depending on the specific metric, but overall, translocated snakes tended to have intermediate values for home range size, movement distances, and sinuosity compared to the two resident groups. Our results suggest that although translocation did affect movement and space use relative to resident snakes, its effect depended on the donor habitat from which translocated snakes were removed. Because irregular movements are often linked to low survival after translocation, it is encouraging that translocated snakes did not move more than snakes from a donor rice agriculture site, a landscape that represents much habitat for remaining populations.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in the recovery of long-lived at-risk taxa like turtles is low juvenile recruitment. Head-starting—the raising of juveniles to larger sizes to improve survival—is one tool that can be used in circumstances where juvenile recruitment is limited. Due to declining populations and difficulty detecting juveniles, however, lack of knowledge of the ecology of juveniles can hinder efforts to develop and evaluate head-starting programs for many turtle species. We sought to inform recovery efforts of Mojave desert tortoises by quantifying multi-year space use and survival of head-started juveniles after release. We radio-tracked tortoises head-started under three different husbandry treatments that varied in rearing duration (from two to over six years) and whether head-starting included an indoor rearing component the first year. We compared post-release space use and survival as a function of treatment, release size, and time since release. We found that space use, including home range size and site fidelity, varied by husbandry treatment, with smaller and younger tortoises having smaller home ranges and higher site fidelity. Additionally, home range size decreased and site fidelity increased with time since release across treatments. Tortoises with an indoor-rearing component experiencing increased risk of mortality as movement increased compared to tortoises reared solely outdoors. Nevertheless, survival did not differ among treatments or with tortoise age or size. Regardless of husbandry treatment, head-started tortoises exhibited similar space-use and survival overall. Our study provides insight into juvenile tortoise behavior and head-starting as a tool for tortoise conservation.",

    "abstract": "A persistent lack of juvenile recruitment in populations of the imperiled Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) has been attributed to artificially inflated populations of coyotes (Canis latrans) and common ravens (Corvus corax) in some areas. Subsidized by resources in the form of road-killed prey, movement corridors, or nesting perches provided by ever-expanding road and powerline networks, these “subsidized predators” threaten tortoises and other species thanks to subsidies that help support their populations in areas where they might otherwise have been less abundant. Here, we quantified the risk of predation from these subsidized predators on juvenile Mojave desert tortoises by quantifying attack rates on 3D-printed replicas. We evaluated predation risk as a function of replica size, distance from powerlines, and season—variables that can inform release strategies of head-started and translocated tortoises. We found significantly greater risk of predation from ravens in the spring than in the fall. Replica size did not significantly influence predation risk from ravens or coyotes. Replica distance from a powerline or road also did not significantly influence predation risk, supporting previous studies that have found the risk of predation can persist for up to 1.6 km from raven nesting structures. Our results support recommendations for releasing juvenile head-started and translocated tortoises in the fall and away from areas close to raven nesting structures. Our study provides insight into the interactions of prey and subsidized predators and helps guide management on potential mitigation strategies for minimizing the impacts of subsidized predators on species like the imperiled Mojave desert tortoise.",

    "abstract": "Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) populations in some regions have declined by >50% since 2004, prompting the need for more research on ways to recover populations. One possible recovery tool is head-starting (i.e., the act of protecting and raising juvenile tortoises to sizes that increase survival upon release); however, head-starting can have high start-up and maintenance costs that can limit its feasibility. Strategies that reduce cost and rearing duration may foster broader and more effective use. We released and radio-tracked 60 juvenile tortoises in the Mojave National Preserve in California, USA, that had been reared under 2 treatments: those reared 1 year indoors after hatching, then 1 year outdoors (combo) and those reared just 1 year indoors (indoor-only). We tested whether indoor-only rearing alone could be a more efficient means of producing robust head-started tortoises. We examined the behavior, movement, and survival of tortoises after release into the wild from 2020 to 2021 to determine whether these outcomes differed between husbandry treatments. Combo tortoises tended to perform settling behaviors (mean ± 1 SE days to building first burrow = 6.7 ± 0.8, entering dormancy = 23.3 ± 2.1, and emerging from dormancy = 189.6 ± 4.4) earlier than indoor-only tortoises (7.4 ± 0.9, 31.5 ± 2.6, and 193.9 ± 5.9, respectively), but this difference was not significant, suggesting the rearing method did not greatly alter settling behavior. Indoor-only tortoises dispersed at least twice as far from their release site (156.2 ± 26.3 m compared with 77.3 ± 20.6 m for combo tortoises), had larger mean use areas (3.7 ± 0.1 ha compared with 2.8 ± 0.3 ha for combo tortoises for 95% Brownian bridge movement model estimates), and greater variability in their movements than combo tortoises (daily average step length post-emergence: 4.3 ± 0.2 m compared with 2.8 ± 0.1 m for combo tortoises). Despite differences in their movements, indoor-only and combo tortoises had similar survival rates over the study, 51% versus 42%, respectively, during a period of extreme drought in 2021. The similarity in survival between groups gives head-starting practitioners freedom in their rearing methods. The indoor-only group had lower site fidelity, which should be considered when this is an undesirable trait for released tortoises.",

    "issued": "2025-04",
    "abstract": "PROBLEM: Academic medical centers struggle with the high cost of care, reduced reimbursement, intense competition, and low profit margins. Many factors, including a high proportion of publicly insured patients, a model rewarding procedural specialties, and research and educational support burden, led to faculty salary inequities, physician disengagement, and difficulty recruiting. APPROACH: UC Davis Health implemented an aligned funds flow model in July 2021 to create a mission-aligned model in which all departments had financial margins to optimize recruitment, retention, research, and teaching. OUTCOMES: The 3-year experience (academic years 2021-2024) with this model at UC Davis Health was characterized by physician compensation, physician recruitment, and profit increases. Total collections for departments increased by 4% in the first year, 0.2% in the second year, and 11.3% in the third year of funds flow. Total productivity increased by 4.9% during the first year, 3.6% during the second year, and 8.4% during the third year. Salaries increased in all departmental categories in year 3. Productivity and collections per faculty member increased during the first year and were stable during the second and third years. Parity among procedural, primary care, and hospital-based service lines was improved because departmental revenue was agnostic to payer mix and hospital agreements were more formulaic. The hospital contribution to funds flow increased from $67 million in 2022 to $101 million in 2024. NEXT STEPS: Regular communication and transparency are critical to ongoing trust and success with implementation of sustaining funds flow. The new model resulted in improved physician compensation and increased hiring. However, the implementation of funds flow had a negative fiscal effect on the academic medical center, and sustainability may require fine-tuning to balance affordability. The authors plan to convert outpatient primary care to productivity-based models and decrease time-limited support for new faculty from 2 years to 1 year.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWhile ultrasound-guided breast biopsy (UGBB) performed by a radiologist is the standard of care in high-income countries for diagnosing breast cancer, blind or surgical biopsy has been the norm in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) in part because LMIC radiologists lack the skill to perform UGBB. We present the study protocol of a competency-based UGBB training program for LMIC Nigerian radiologists that leverages mobile health technology.MethodsThis institutional review board-approved prospective multi-institutional single-arm clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04501419) involves 13 Nigerian radiologists from eight tertiary hospitals in South West and South East Nigeria. Our training program is unique because it uses a competency-based curriculum developed specifically for LMIC radiologists. The competency-based curriculum incorporates blended learning (e-learning and trainer-led), simulation (supervised and unsupervised), and patient biopsy (supervised and unsupervised) components. The study time frame is two years: 1 year for the trainees to complete active training and patient recruitment and another 1 year for patient follow-up. Primary outcome measures include trainees' competency (measured using the Ottawa Surgical Competency Operating Room Evaluation (O-SCORE)), the radiology-pathology concordance rate, and the complication rate. Secondary outcome measures include the diagnostic interval and the positive predictive value of UGBB.ConclusionBuilding capacity for UGBB in Nigeria and other LMIC can potentially improve breast cancer outcomes through early diagnosis. This training program is part of an implementation multi-component strategy package in Nigeria to improve breast cancer outcomes. This training program can also be adapted for other image-guided procedures that could impact global cancer control through diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and/or palliation.",

    "issued": "2025-01",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Surveys to assess views about artificial intelligence (AI) of various diagnostic radiology constituencies have revealed interesting combinations of enthusiasm, caution, and implementation priorities. We surveyed academic radiology leaders about their views on AI and how they intend to approach AI implementation in their departments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a web survey of Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments members between October 5 and October 31, 2023, to solicit optimism or pessimism about AI, target use cases, planned implementation, and perceptions of their workforce. P values are provided only for descriptive purposes and have not been adjusted for multiple testing in this exploratory research. RESULTS: The survey was sent to the 112 Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments members and 43 responded (38%). Chairs were optimistic, with no statistical difference between views of AI in general versus generative AI. Chairs plan to implement AI to improve quality and efficiency (43 of 43, 100%), burnout (41 of 43, 95%), health care costs (22 of 43, 51%), and equity (27 of 43, 63%) and most likely will target the postprocessing (26 of 43, 60%), interpretation workflow (26 of 43, 60%), and image acquisition (18 of 43, 42%) steps in the imaging value chain. Chairs perceived that radiologists (36 of 43, 84%) and technologists (38 of 43, 88%) were not particularly worried about being displaced but saw trainees as slightly less confident (31 of 43, 72%). Free text responses revealed concerns about the cost of AI and emphasized trade-offs that needed to be balanced. CONCLUSION: Radiology chairs are optimistic about AI and poised to tackle departmental challenges. Concerns about generative AI and workforce replacement are minimal.",

    "issued": "2025-03",
    "abstract": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate an AI algorithm that detects breast cancer in MRI scans up to one year before radiologists typically identify it, potentially enhancing early detection in high-risk women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A convolutional neural network (CNN) AI model, pre-trained on breast MRI data, was fine-tuned using a retrospective dataset of 3029 MRI scans from 910 patients. These contained 115 cancers that were diagnosed within one year of a negative MRI. The model aimed to identify these cancers, with the goal of predicting cancer development up to one year in advance. The network was fine-tuned and tested with 10-fold cross-validation. Mean age of patients was 52 years (range, 18-88 years), with average follow-up of 4.3 years (range 1-12 years). RESULTS: The AI detected cancers one year earlier with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 (0.67-0.76). Retrospective analysis by a radiologist of the top 10% highest risk MRIs as ranked by the AI could have increased early detection by up to 30%. (35/115, CI:22.2-39.7%, 30% sensitivity). A radiologist identified a visual correlate to biopsy-proven cancers in 83 of prior-year MRIs (83/115, CI: 62.1-79.4%). The AI algorithm identified the anatomic region where cancer would be detected in 66 cases (66/115, CI:47.8-66.5%); with both agreeing in 54 cases (54/115, CI:%37.5-56.4%). CONCLUSION: This novel AI-aided re-evaluation of \"benign\" breasts shows promise for improving early breast cancer detection with MRI. As datasets grow and image quality improves, this approach is expected to become even more impactful.",

    "issued": "2025-04",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterize the effect of embolic particle size on outcomes of uterine artery embolization (UAE) for mixed adenomyosis/fibroids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective database was compiled of all patients with mixed adenomyosis/fibroids who underwent UAE with microspheres (Embosphere [Merit Medical, South Jordan, Utah] and Embozene [Varian, Palo Alto, California]) from September 2015 to May 2022 (n = 76; mean age, 46.7 years [standard deviation {SD} ± 5.7]). Demographic, clinical, imaging, procedural, and follow-up data were collected. Intraprocedurally, initial particle size was chosen according to proceduralist judgment and subsequently upsized as needed until near-stasis was achieved. Initial particle size was categorized as either small (Embosphere 300-500 μm and Embozene 500 μm) or large (Embosphere 500-700 μm and Embozene 700 μm). The effect of initial particle size on patient-reported symptomatic improvement was assessed with logistic regression, with preprocedural uterine volume, presence of focal adenomyoma, and total number of vials of embolic material as regression covariates. RESULTS: Preprocedural symptoms included menorrhagia (89.5%), pelvic pain (53.9%), and bulk symptoms (60.5%). The baseline mean uterine volume was 748.5 mL (SD ± 543.9). Postprocedurally, 89.1%, 92.3%, and 97.4% reported improvement in menorrhagia, pelvic pain, and bulk symptoms, respectively. Initial embolic particle sizing was not significantly associated with patient-reported improvement in menorrhagia (P = .134), pelvic pain (P = .598), or bulk symptoms (P = .151), when controlling for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: When controlling for covariates, smaller-calibrated microspheres had similar postprocedural pain outcomes as larger particles, with similar target outcomes in UAE for mixed adenomyosis/fibroids.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The goals of this study were to determine the incidence and duration of hypotension and hypoxia in the prehospital setting in patients with potentially survivable brain injuries, and to prospectively examine the association of these secondary insults with mortality and disability at hospital discharge. METHODS: Trauma patients with suspected brain injuries underwent continuous blood pressure and pulse oximetry monitoring during helicopter transport. Postadmission inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan, operative findings, or autopsy findings; and (2) Head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of > or = 3 or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < or = 12 within the first 24 hours of admission. Patients were excluded with (1) no abnormal intracranial findings on the patient's CT scan; (2) determination of a nonsurvivable injury (based on an AIS score of 6 for any body region; or, (3) death in less than 12 hours after injury. Primary outcome measures included mortality and Disability Rating Scale score at discharge. RESULTS: We enrolled 150 patients into the study. Fifty-seven patients had at least one secondary insult; 37 had only hypoxic episodes, 14 had only hypotensive episodes, and 6 patients had both. Demographics and injury characteristics did not differ between those with and those without secondary insults. The mortality for patients without secondary insults was 20%, compared with 37% for patients with hypoxic episodes, 8% for patients with hypotensive episodes, and 24% for patients with both. The Disability Rating Scale score at discharge was significantly higher in patients with secondary insults. Using multivariate analysis, the calculated odds ratio of mortality caused by prehospital hypoxia after head injury was 2.66 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary insults after TBI are common, and these insults are associated with disability. Hypoxia in the prehospital setting significantly increases the odds of mortality after brain injury controlled for multiple variables.",

    "issued": "2004-06",
    "abstract": "Intermittent hypoxia (IH) occurs in many pathophysiological conditions. The molecular mechanisms associated with IH, however, have received little attention. Previous studies have reported that the c-fos gene via formation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor contributes to adaptive responses to continuous hypoxia. In the present study, using a cell culture model we examined whether IH activates c-fos and AP-1 and if so, by what mechanisms. Experiments were performed on rat phaeochromocytoma cells exposed to 21% O(2) (normoxia) or 60 and 120 cycles of IH, each cycle consisting 15 s of hypoxia followed by 4 min of normoxia. IH resulted in a significant elevation of c-fos mRNA as well as transcriptional activation. IH was more potent and induced a longer lasting activation of c-fos than comparable cumulative duration of continuous hypoxia. IH increased AP-1 activity and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA, an AP-1-regulated downstream gene, and these effects were prevented by antisense c-fos. Superoxide dismutase mimetic, a potent scavenger of superoxide anions, prevented IH-induced c-fos, AP-1 and TH activations. IH increased superoxide anion levels in mitochondria as evidenced by decreased aconitase enzyme activity and increased levels of hydrogen peroxide, a stable dismutated product of superoxide anions. Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was markedly inhibited in IH exposed cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of complex I mimicked the effects of IH during normoxia and occluded the effects of IH on c-fos activation, suggesting the involvement of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the generation of superoxide anions during IH. These results suggest IH-induced c-fos-mediated transcriptional activation involves oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resuscitative thoracotomy (TCY) after trauma has an overall dismal survival rate, yet patients with isolated penetrating chest wounds have the best chance of meaningful recovery. Although the major factor in outcome is presenting physiology, the site of the TCY may influence survival, with the operating room offering a superior environment to the emergency room. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of location of TCY on outcome after penetrating chest injury. METHODS: This was a multicenter study of patients admitted with either stab (SW) or gunshot wound (GSW) to the chest, with systolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg, and who underwent TCY within 60 minutes of arrival. Time to TCY, Injury Severity Score, location of TCY (emergency room, operating room, or resuscitation room), and detectable systolic pressure at admission were among the factors studied. RESULTS: Over a 4-year period, 78 SW and 140 GSW victims underwent TCY. GSW victims had greater Injury Severity Scores (39.4 +/- 23.1 for GSW vs. 27.2 +/- 15.7 for SW, p < 0.001) and mortality (69% for GSW vs. 37% for SW, p < 0.001). No parameter studied was found to be significantly associated with survival after SW. After GSW, survival was 13.5 times more likely if TCY was performed in the resuscitation room (confidence interval, 3.3-54.6) and 22 times more likely if it was performed in the operating room (confidence interval, 6.7-73.7). CONCLUSION: Although patient selection is the primary factor determining outcome, there may be an independent benefit for performing TCY after GSW in a specialized resuscitation room or the operating room.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trauma is a major public health problem and organized systems of trauma care have been shown to substantially reduce trauma-related mortality. Currently California and many other states have incompletely developed systems of trauma care delivery. This study was undertaken to determine how frequently patients incurring serious trauma in California receive treatment at a trauma center. STUDY DESIGN: Hospital discharge records for 360,743 acute trauma patients for 1995 to 1997 were analyzed. Abbreviated Injury Scale scores were calculated from discharge diagnosis codes. Severity of trauma and the need for trauma center treatment was defined by eight Abbreviated Injury Scale criteria combined with patient age and type of injury. RESULTS: According to study criteria, 67,718 patients needed trauma center care and 56% were treated at a trauma center. Among patients less than 55 years of age, 62% were treated at a trauma center compared with 40% of those aged 55 years or more (p < 0.0001). For patients less than 55 years old with brain injuries, 66% were treated at a trauma center compared with 44% for patients aged 55 years or more (p < 0.0001). Of the 29,849 patients who met Abbreviated Injury Scale criteria but were not treated at trauma centers, 59% were in counties with designated trauma centers and 41% were in counties without trauma centers. CONCLUSIONS: Only 56% of seriously injured patients in California were treated at trauma centers, despite most of the injuries occurring in the catchment areas of designated trauma care systems. Substantial undertriage of serious trauma patients to trauma centers appears to be occurring, especially in older persons and in persons with brain injuries. Efforts to understand why undertriage is occurring so frequently are hampered by fragmentation of the systems of care, inadequate data management systems, and lack of trauma care performance reporting by non-trauma center hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), with its targeted delivery of cytotoxic ionizing radiation, demonstrates significant potential for treating a wide spectrum of malignancies, with particularly unique benefits for metastatic disease. There is an opportunity to optimize RPTs and enhance the precision of theranostics by moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and using patient-specific image-based dosimetry for personalized treatment planning. Such an approach, however, requires accurate methods and tools for the mathematic modeling and prediction of dose and clinical outcome. To this end, the SNMMI AI-Dosimetry Working Group is promoting the paradigm of computational nuclear oncology: mathematic models and computational tools describing the hierarchy of etiologic mechanisms involved in RPT dose response. This includes radiopharmacokinetics for image-based internal dosimetry and radiobiology for the mapping of dose response to clinical endpoints. The former area originates in pharmacotherapy, whereas the latter originates in radiotherapy. Accordingly, models and methods developed in these predecessor disciplines serve as a foundation on which to develop a repurposed set of tools more appropriate to RPT. Over the long term, this computational nuclear oncology framework also promises to facilitate widespread cross-fertilization of ideas between nuclear medicine and the greater mathematic and computational oncology communities.",

    "abstract": "Computational nuclear oncology for precision radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is a new frontier for theranostic treatment personalization. A key strategy relies on the possibility to incorporate clinical, biomarker, image-based, and dosimetric information in theranostic digital twins (TDTs) of patients to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. The TDT framework enables treatment optimization by real-time monitoring of the real-world system, simulation of different treatment scenarios, and prediction of resulting treatment outcomes, as well as facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing among health care professionals adopting a harmonized TDT. To this aim, the major social, ethical, and regulatory challenges related to TDT implementation and adoption have been analyzed. Methods: The artificial intelligence-dosimetry working group of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging is actively proposing, motivating, and developing the field of computational nuclear oncology, a unified set of scientific principles and mathematic models that describe the hierarchy of etiologic mechanisms involved in RPT dose response. The major social, ethical, and regulatory challenges to realize TDTs have been highlighted from the literature and discussed within the working group, and possible solutions have been identified. Results: This technology demands the implementation of advanced computational tools, harmonized and standardized collection of large real-time data, and modeling protocols to enable interoperability across institutions. However, current legislations limit data sharing despite TDTs' benefiting from such data. Although anonymizing data is often sufficient, ethical concerns may prevent sharing without patient consent. Approaches such as seeking ethical approval, adopting federated learning, and following guidelines can address this issue. Accurate and updated data input is crucial for reliable TDT output. Lack of reimbursement for data processing in treatment planning and verification poses an economic barrier. Ownership of TDTs, especially in interconnected systems, requires clear contracts to allocate liability. Complex contracts may hinder TDT implementation. Robust security measures are necessary to protect against data breaches. Cross-border data sharing complicates risk management without a global framework. Conclusion: A mechanism-based TDT framework can guide the community toward personalized dosimetry-driven RPT by facilitating the information exchange necessary to identify robust prognostic or predictive dosimetry and biomarkers. Although the future is bright, we caution that care must be taken to ensure that TDT technology is implemented in a socially responsible manner.",

    "abstract": "The performance of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) detectors has been constrained by the photodetector collection of optical photons emitted in the scintillator, which was limited to photons reaching the exit surface with an angle larger than the critical angle. Photonic Crystals (PhCs) are periodic nanostructures with sizes comparable to the optical photons' wavelengths, which can break through the critical angle limit. Thorough experimental investigation of PhCs effect on optical harvest in scintillator detectors is complex and costly. Simulation can overcome these challenges. Mainstream software such as GATE does not support PhCs simulation. Here, we generalize the GATE optical model by incorporating the PhCs optical model into the LUT Davis model. We can model the performance of advanced scintillator detectors via the generalized LUT Davis model. The scintillator and PhCs materials tested in this work were lutetium oxyorthosilicate and titanium dioxide, respectively. Scintillators with a cross-section of 3×3 mm2 or 10×10 mm2 and a thickness varying from 9 mm to 18 mm with a step size of 3 mm were modeled with a PhCs interface to the photodetector. Among the 4 tested PhCs configurations, the best optical photon harvest was improved by 62.4% compared to traditional coupling with variable results between PhCs structures. The energy resolution only slightly improved. We thus investigated the angular distribution of collected optical photons, which can guide the optimization of photodetectors' detection efficiency at specific angles.",

    "abstract": "The material requirements for gamma-ray detectors for medical imaging applications are multi-fold and sensitivity is often overlooked. High effective atomic number (Zeff) Cherenkov radiators have raised the attention in the community due to their potential for harvesting prompt photons. A material with one of the highest Zeff and thus short gamma-ray attenuation length is thallium chloride (TlCl). By doping TlCl with beryllium (Be) or iodine (I), it becomes a scintillator and therefore produces scintillation photons upon gamma-ray interaction on top of the prompt Cherenkov luminescence. The scintillation response of TlCl:Be,I is investigated in terms of intensity, energy resolution, kinetics, and timing capability with and without energy discrimination. The ratio of prompt to slow scintillation photons is used to derive the intrinsic number of produced Cherenkov photons and compared with analytic calculations avoiding complex Monte-Carlo simulations. The experimentally determined number of Cherenkov photons upon 511 keV gamma excitation of 17.9 ± 4.6 photons is in line with our simple calculations yielding 14.5 photons. We observe three scintillation decay time components with an effective decay time of 60 ns. The scintillation light yield of 0.9 ph/keV is sufficient to discriminate events with low energy deposition in the crystal which is used to improve the measured coincidence time resolution from 360 ps FWHM without energy selection down to 235 ps after energy discrimination and time walk correction for 2.8 mm thick TlCl:Be,I crystals, and from 580 ps to 402 ps for 15.2 mm thick ones. Already with the first generation of doped TlCl encouraging timing capability close to other materials with lower effective atomic number has been achieved.",

    "abstract": "Most research on exposure to violence focuses on direct victimization, offending, or witnessed violence, yet many people also experience concerns about potential violence in their environments and social networks. Using a state-representative survey of California adults (n = 2870) administered in July 2020, we estimate the prevalence of anticipatory concerns about violence within respondents' social networks and describe characteristics of the persons at perceived risk of violence, reasons for respondents' concerns, and actions undertaken by respondents to reduce that risk. Approximately 1 in 5 respondents knew at least one person, usually a friend or extended family member, whom they perceived to be at risk of other- or self-directed violence. Among respondents living with the person at perceived risk, about one-quarter reported household firearm ownership. Alcohol and substance misuse and a history of violence were among respondents' top reasons for concern; serious mental illness and firearm access also contributed to concerns. About one-quarter of respondents with such concerns said harm was likely or very likely to occur in the next year. Most respondents reported having taken action to reduce the risk of violence, including providing resources and asking family or friends to help; few acted to reduce access to lethal means. The most common reasons for inaction were the perception that a dangerous situation was unlikely and that it was a personal matter. Our findings can help inform a broader understanding of exposure to violence and interventions that leverage the knowledge of those close to persons at risk to prevent violence.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Analysis of the costs associated with emergency department (ED) visits after discharge for violent injury could highlight subgroups for the development of cost-effective interventions to support healing and prevent treatment failures in violently injured patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort review was conducted of all patients with return ED visits within 90 days of discharge after treatment for a violent injury occurring between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2018. Hospital costs were calculated for each incidence and analyzed against demographic and injury type variables to identify trends. RESULTS: 218 return ED visits were identified. Hospital costs showed a high frequency of low-cost visits. For more complex visits, distinct cost patterns were observed for Black and LatinX males compared to White males as a function of age. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of hospital cost per visit identified trends among different subgroups. Underlying etiologies presumably vary between groups, but hypothesis-driven further investigation and needs assessment is required. Understanding the driving forces behind these cost trends may aid in developing effective interventions.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:: This study examined changes in geographic proximity to family members among race and income groups in the United States from 1981 to 2017. BACKGROUND:: Close geographic proximity to family members can facilitate mutual support and strengthen family bonds. Some scholars argue that institutional sources of support have replaced many core family functions, which might mean that households are likely to live increasingly farther away from family. Advancing technology and changing labor market opportunities might reinforce this pattern. Yet, the ongoing cultural and emotional salience of family might curtail the effects of these factors on the increasing distance to family. METHOD:: We conducted a quantitative analysis of longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We utilized the multigenerational structure of the PSID and restricted-use geocodes to map kin proximity at every interview from 1981 to 2017. We cross-classified our sample by race and income, focusing on Black and White respondents across income quartiles (n = 171,501 person-periods). RESULTS:: High-income White respondents showed the greatest increases in distance from kin over time, whereas proximity to kin among other race-income groups was relatively stable. CONCLUSION:: Proximate kin has become less central in the lives of high-income White households over time, whereas close proximity to kin has been the norm over time for other racial and income groups. These results have implications for racial and income differences in kin relations over time.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Living near an incident of firearm violence can negatively impact youth, regardless of whether the violence is experienced firsthand. Inequities in household and neighborhood resources may affect the prevalence and consequences of exposure across racial/ethnic groups. FINDINGS: Using data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study and the Gun Violence Archive, we estimate that approximately 1 in 4 adolescents in large US cities lived within 800 m (0.5 miles) of a past-year firearm homicide during 2014-17. Exposure risk decreased as household income and neighborhood collective efficacy increased, though stark racial/ethnic inequities remained. Across racial/ethnic groups, adolescents in poor households in moderate or high collective efficacy neighborhoods had a similar risk of past-year firearm homicide exposure as middle-to-high income adolescents in low collective efficacy neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Empowering communities to build and leverage social ties may be as impactful for reducing firearm violence exposure as income supports. Comprehensive violence prevention efforts should include systems-level strategies that jointly strengthen family and community resources.",

    "abstract": "Violence is defined as \"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation.\" Encompassed in this definition are multiple, interrelated forms of violence, including interpersonal firearm death and injury, but also the systems, policies, and practices enacted by those with power to advantage some groups while depriving others of meaningful opportunities for meeting their basic needs-known as \"structural violence\". Yet dominant violence prevention narratives too often ignore or deemphasize the deeply intertwined threads of structural violence with other forms of violence, leading to policies and practices that are frequently insufficient, and often harmful, for reducing interpersonal firearm violence and building community safety, particularly in minoritized and structurally marginalized communities. We highlight ways in which limited scrutiny of structural violence, the omission of its defining characteristics-power and deprivation-from functional characterizations and frameworks of interpersonal firearm violence, and the inadequate distribution of power and resources to those most impacted by violence to self-determine narratives of and solutions to interpersonal firearm violence grossly impacts how interpersonal firearm violence is collectively conceived, discussed, and addressed. Expanding dominant narratives of interpersonal firearm violence, guided by the wisdom and determination of those most impacted, such that the goal of prevention and intervention efforts is not merely the absence of violence but rather the creation of a community safety and health ecosystem is essential to meet this critical moment in firearm violence research and prevention.",

    "issued": "2021-02",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify differences in patient-physician interactions associated with improvements in GERD symptoms in a randomized controlled trial comparing integrative medicine and primary care/standard visits. METHODS: We analyzed video recordings of 2-minute excerpts (thin slices) from the beginning, middle, and end of 21 study visits (11 standard, 10 integrative medicine). RESULTS: According to blind coders' analysis of the excerpts, prospective improvement in GERD symptoms was most highly correlated with patients appearing pleased (r = 0.71, p < 0.01) and friendly (r = 0.67, p < 0.01) at the end of the visit, controlling for visit type. The combination of patient and physician smiling at the end of the visit was associated with improvement in GERD symptoms (r2 = 0.45, p = 0.004). The physician in the integrative visits was more engaged (p = 0.009), friendly (p = 0.005), relaxed (p = 0.002), smiled longer (p = 0.006), gazed longer (p = 0.02), and gestured more (p = 0.007), compared to standard visits. Patients in integrative visits also smiled longer (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The expanded history-taking questions asked by integrative clinicians may enhance relationship building, modifying patients' responses and improving patient-centered behaviors from clinicians,ultimately facilitating symptom improvement. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Analysis of nonverbal behaviors may facilitate a better understanding of patient-clinician interactions in integrative medicine visits and yield insights to improve clinical interactions in conventional medicine.",

    "issued": "2013-09",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In 2002 the American Medical Student Association (AMSA) created a fourth-year medical student elective known as the Humanistic Elective in alternative medicine, Activism, and Reflective Transformation (HEART) that provided the opportunity for students to explore humanism in medicine, self-care, complementary and alternative medicine modalities, communication, activism, and community building in a four-week immersion experience. The educational effects of this elective, and whether it has met its stated goals, are unknown. METHOD: The authors conducted a web-based, cross-sectional survey of the first eight cohorts of HEART graduates in 2010. Survey questions assessed respondents' demographics and perspectives on the educational impact of the elective. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and qualitative analyses were guided by grounded theory. RESULTS: Of 168 eligible alumni, 122 (73%) completed the survey. The majority were female (70%), age ≤35 (77%) years, and trained in primary care specialties (66%). Half were attendings in practice. The majority of respondents felt the elective taught professionalism (89%) and communication skills (92%) well or very well. The majority highly agreed that the elective helped them better cope with stress during residency training (80%), taught them self-care skills (75%), and improved their ability to empathize and connect with patients (71%). Qualitative analysis of the personal and professional impact of the elective identified twelve common themes with self-discovery, self-care, and collegial development/community most frequently cited. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of HEART graduates endorse learning important skills and benefiting from the experience both personally and professionally. Aspects of the HEART curriculum may help training programs teach professionalism and improve trainee well-being.",

    "abstract": "This short communication describes a new open-source implementation of the CALVIN model (CALifornia Value Integrated Network), a large-scale network flow optimization model of California's water supply system. The model is cross-platform, uses common data formats, and connects to several freely available linear programming solvers. Given inputs including hydrology, urban/agricultural demand curves, and variable operating costs, the model minimizes the systemwide cost of water scarcity and operations including surface and groundwater reservoirs, wastewater reuse, desalination, environmental flow requirements, and hydropower. Key outputs include water shortage costs and marginal economic values of water and infrastructure capacity. We benchmark the scalability of different solvers up to roughly 5 million decision variables, using shared-memory parallelization on a high performance computing cluster. Runtimes are reduced by two orders of magnitude relative to the original model when no initial solution is provided, in addition to the benefits such as accessibility and transparency that come with an open-source platform. While this model is specific to California, the data and model structure are separated, so a similar framework could be used in any system where water allocation has been formulated as a network flow problem.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid poplar has potential as feedstock for the production of bioenergy and bio-based products. Planning effective placement of hybrid poplar based biorefinery facilities takes tremendous time and financial resources. A hybrid poplar based biorefinery siting application (HP-BiSWA), a web-enabled refinery siting application, was developed so that potential stakeholders may quickly assess available resources at selected locations and provide information relating to the economic competitiveness and financial risks associated with construction and operation. At present, the tool supports evaluation of the potential for hybrid poplar based jet fuel and acetic acid production based on user-specified conditions. The application is generally expandable to other feedstock, technology, and product types. HP-BiSWA uses various modules (i.e. 3PG-crop growth model and farm budget application) and services (i.e. parcel service, transportation routing service, crop service, soil and weather services) to retrieve and estimate information to optimize and select potential parcels for poplar cultivation, and ultimately determine net revenue for biofuel production under selected decision options. To demonstrate the utility of HP-BiSWA, a case study analysis was performed for Centralia, WA based on a 380 ML/yr (100 MGY) jet fuel biorefinery using two scenarios: (1) a 175 km feedstock supply radius with 50% pastureland use, and (2) a 225 km feedstock supply radius with 25% pastureland use. The case study captures the interactive effects on biorefinery performance with changes in feedstock supply area and available water, power, and other resources for operation of the biorefinery.",

Spatial estimates of biomass yields under different management regimes are required for assisting stakeholders in making better management decisions and to establish viable woody cropping systems for biofuel production. To support stakeholders in their management decisions, we have developed a GIS-based web interface using a modified 3PG model for spatially predicting poplar biomass yields under different management and climate conditions in the U.S. Pacific Northwest region. The application is implemented with standard HTML5 components, allowing its use in a modern browser and dynamically adjusting to the client screen size and device. In addition, cloud storage of the results makes them accessible on any Internet-enabled device. The web interface appears simple, but is powerful in parameter manipulation and in visualizing and sharing the results. Overall, this application comprises dynamic features that enable users to run SRWC crop growth simulations based on GIS information and contributes significantly to choosing appropriate feedstock growing locations, anticipating the desired physiological properties of the feedstock and incorporating the management and policy analysis needed for growing hybrid poplar plantations.",

    "abstract": "Wildtype fruit of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) are typically soft and highly perishable when fully ripe. The development of firm-fruited cultivars by phenotypic selection has greatly increased shelf-life, decreased postharvest perishability, and driven the expansion of strawberry production worldwide. Hypotheses for the firm-fruited phenotype include mutations affecting the expression of genes encoding polygalacturonases (PGs) that soften fruit by degrading cell wall pectins. Here we show that loss-of-function mutations in the fruit softening gene POLYGALACTURONASE1 (FaPG1; PG1-6A1) double fruit firmness in strawberry. PG1-6A1 was one of three tandemly duplicated PG genes found to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting fruit firmness on chromosome 6A. PG1-6A1 was strongly expressed in soft-fruited (wildtype) homozygotes and weakly expressed in firm-fruited (mutant) homozygotes. Genome-wide association, quantitative trait transcript, DNA sequence, and expression-QTL analyses identified genetic variants in LD with PG1-6A1 that were positively correlated with fruit firmness and negatively correlated with PG1-6A1 expression. An Enhancer/Suppressor-mutator (En/Spm) transposable element insertion was discovered upstream of PG1-6A1 in mutant homozygotes that we hypothesize transcriptionally downegulates the expression of PG1-6A1. The PG1-6A1 locus was incompletely dominant and explained 26–76% of the genetic variance for fruit firmness among phenotypically diverse individuals. Additional loci are hypothesized to underlie the missing heritability. Highly accurate codominant genotyping assays were developed for modifying fruit firmness by marker-assisted selection of the En/Spm insertion and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the PG1-6A1 locus.",

    "abstract": "Heterosis was the catalyst for the domestication of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa), an interspecific hybrid species that originated in the 1700s. The hybrid origin was discovered because the phenotypes of spontaneous hybrids transgressed those of their parent species. The transgressions included fruit yield increases and other genetic gains in the twentieth century that sparked the global expansion of strawberry production. The importance of heterosis to the agricultural success of the hybrid species, however, has remained a mystery. Here we show that heterosis has disappeared (become fixed) among improved hybrids within a population (the California population) that has been under long-term selection for increased fruit yield, weight, and firmness. We found that the highest yielding hybrids are among the most highly inbred (59-79%), which seems counterintuitive for a highly heterozygous, outbreeder carrying heavy genetic loads. Although faint remnants of heterosis were discovered, the between-parent allele frequency differences and dispersed favorable dominant alleles necessary for heterosis have decreased nearly genome-wide within the California population. Conversely, heterosis was prevalent and significant among wide hybrids, especially for fruit count, a significant driver of genetic gains for fruit yield. We attributed the disappearance (fixation) of heterosis within the California population to increased homozygosity of favorable dominant alleles and inbreeding associated with selection, random genetic drift, and selective sweeps. Despite historical inbreeding, the highest yielding hybrids reported to-date are estimated to be heterozygous for 20,370-44,280 of 97,000-108,000 genes in the octoploid genome, the equivalent of an entire diploid genome or more.",

    "abstract": "Verticillium wilt (VW), a devastating vascular wilt disease of strawberry (Fragaria × $\\times$  ananassa), has caused economic losses for nearly a century. This disease is caused by the soil-borne pathogen Verticillium dahliae, which occurs nearly worldwide and causes disease in numerous agriculturally important plants. The development of VW-resistant cultivars is critically important for the sustainability of strawberry production. We previously showed that a preponderance of the genetic resources (asexually propagated hybrid individuals) preserved in public germplasm collections were moderately to highly susceptible and that genetic gains for increased resistance to VW have been negligible over the last 60 years. To more fully understand the challenges associated with breeding for increased quantitative resistance to this pathogen, we developed and phenotyped a training population of hybrids (  n = 564 $n = 564$  ) among elite parents with a wide range of resistance phenotypes. When these data were combined with training data from a population of elite and exotic hybrids (  n = 386 $n = 386$  ), genomic prediction accuracies of 0.47-0.48 were achieved and were predicted to explain 70%-75% of the additive genetic variance for resistance. We concluded that breeding values for resistance to VW can be predicted with sufficient accuracy for effective genomic selection with routine updating of training populations.",

    "abstract": "The annual production of strawberry has increased by one million tonnes in the US and 8.4 million tonnes worldwide since 1960. Here we show that the US expansion was driven by genetic gains from Green Revolution breeding and production advances that increased yields by 2,755%. Using a California population with a century-long breeding history and phenotypes of hybrids observed in coastal California environments, we estimate that breeding has increased fruit yields by 2,974-6,636%, counts by 1,454-3,940%, weights by 228-504%, and firmness by 239-769%. Using genomic prediction approaches, we pinpoint the origin of the Green Revolution to the early 1950s and uncover significant increases in additive genetic variation caused by transgressive segregation and phenotypic diversification. Lastly, we show that the most consequential Green Revolution breeding breakthrough was the introduction of photoperiod-insensitive, PERPETUAL FLOWERING hybrids in the 1970s that doubled yields and drove the dramatic expansion of strawberry production in California.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae (Fof) race 1 is avirulent on cultivars with the dominant resistance gene FW1, while Fof race 2 is virulent on FW1-resistant cultivars. We hypothesized there was a gene-for-gene interaction between a gene at the FW1 locus and an avirulence gene (AvrFW1) in Fof race 1. To identify a candidate AvrFW1, we compared genomes of 24 Fof race 1 and three Fof race 2 isolates. We found one candidate gene that was present in race 1, was absent in race 2, was highly expressed in planta, and was homologous to a known effector, secreted in xylem 6 (SIX6). We knocked out SIX6 in two Fof race 1 isolates by homologous recombination. All SIX6 knockout transformants (ΔSIX6) gained virulence on FW1/fw1 cultivars, whereas ectopic transformants and the wildtype isolates remained avirulent. ΔSIX6 isolates were quantitatively less virulent on FW1/fw1 cultivars Fronteras and San Andreas than fw1/fw1 cultivars. Seedlings from an FW1/fw1 × fw1/fw1 population were genotyped for FW1 and tested for susceptibility to a SIX6 knockout isolate. Results suggested that additional minor-effect quantitative resistance genes could be present at the FW1 locus. This work demonstrates that SIX6 acts as an avirulence factor interacting with a resistance gene at the FW1 locus. The identification of AvrFW1 enables surveillance for Fof race 2 and provides insight into the mechanisms of FW1-mediated resistance. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Therefore, we sought to identify these parameters in a precise and quantitative manner, using bulk and single nanoparticle analysis methods to identify protein loading capacity and subsequent intracellular delivery. We identified incubation temperature, cargo concentration, lipid anchor (LA) structure (lipid nature, linker) and EV origin as critical factors influencing maximal EV loading capacity. Precise control of these parameters enabled to load cargo protein close to EV saturation without hindering cellular delivery. The structural properties of LA influenced not only cargo protein/EV association but also intracellular delivery into different carcinoma cell lines. By thoroughly characterising Lipid‐PEG‐protein anchorage, this study evidences the interest of this tunable and controllable approach for efficient EV protein delivery.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are diverse nanoparticles with large heterogeneity in size and molecular composition. Although this heterogeneity provides high diagnostic value for liquid biopsy and confers many exploitable functions for therapeutic applications in cancer detection, wound healing and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, it has also impeded their clinical translation-hence heterogeneity acts as a double-edged sword. Here we review the impact of subpopulation heterogeneity on EV function and identify key cornerstones for addressing heterogeneity in the context of modern analytical platforms with single-particle resolution. We outline concrete steps towards the identification of key active biomolecules that determine EV mechanisms of action across different EV subtypes. We describe how such knowledge could accelerate EV-based therapies and engineering approaches for mimetic artificial nanovesicle formulations. This approach blunts one edge of the sword, leaving only a single razor-sharp edge on which EV heterogeneity can be exploited for therapeutic applications across many diseases.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are future promising therapeutics, but their instability in vivo after administration remains an important barrier to their further development. Many groups evaluated EV surface modification strategies to add a targeting group with the aim of controlling EV biodistribution. Conversely, fewer groups focused on their stabilization to obtain \"stealth\" allogenic EVs. Modulating their stabilization and biodistribution is an essential prerequisite for their development as nano-therapeutics. Here, we explored polyoxazolines with lipid anchors association to the EV membrane (POxylation as an alternative to PEGylation) to stabilize EVs in plasma and control their biodistribution, while preserving their native properties. We found that this modification maintained and seemed to potentiate the immunomodulatory properties of EVs derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC). Using a radiolabeling protocol to track EVs at a therapeutically relevant concentration in vivo, we demonstrated that POxylation is a promising option to stabilize EVs in plasma because it increased EV half-life by 6 fold at 6 h post-injection. Moreover, EV accumulation in tumors was higher after POxylation than after PEGylation.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review examines the landscape of extracellular vesicle (EV)-related clinical trials to elucidate the field's trends in clinical applications and EV-related methodologies, with an additional focus on the acknowledgement of EV subpopulations. By analysing data from public reporting repositories, we catalogued 471 EV-related clinical trials to date, with indications for over 200 diseases. Diagnostics and companion diagnostics represented the bulk of EV-related clinical trials with cancer being the most frequent application. EV-related therapeutics trials mainly utilized mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) EVs and were most frequently used for treatment of respiratory illnesses. Ultracentrifugation and RNA-sequencing were the most common isolation and characterization techniques; however, methodology for each was not frequently reported in study records. Most of the reported characterization relied on bulk characterization of EV isolates, with only 11% utilizing EV subpopulations in their experimental design. While this may be connected to a lack of available techniques suitable for clinical implementation, it also highlights the opportunity for use of EV subpopulations to improve translational efforts. As academic research identifies more chemically distinct subpopulations and technologies for their enrichment, we forecast to more refined EV trials in the near future. This review emphasizes the need for meticulous methodological reporting and consideration of EV subpopulations to enhance the translational success of EV-based interventions, pointing towards a paradigm shift in personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA complexes are transforming medicine. However, the medical applications of LNPs are limited by their low endosomal disruption rates, high toxicity and long tissue persistence times. LNPs that rapidly hydrolyse in endosomes (RD-LNPs) could solve the problems limiting LNP-based therapeutics and dramatically expand their applications but have been challenging to synthesize. Here we present an acid-degradable linker termed 'azido-acetal' that hydrolyses in endosomes within minutes and enables the production of RD-LNPs. Acid-degradable lipids composed of polyethylene glycol lipids, anionic lipids and cationic lipids were synthesized with the azido-acetal linker and used to generate RD-LNPs, which significantly improved the performance of LNP-mRNA complexes in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, RD-LNPs delivered mRNA more efficiently to the liver, lung, spleen and brains of mice and to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in vitro than conventional LNPs. These experiments demonstrate that engineering LNP hydrolysis rates in vivo has great potential for expanding the medical applications of LNPs.",

    "abstract": "Field trials were performed during the 2021 and 2022 seasons to evaluate the efficacy of several commercial fungicide products in controlling Alternaria late blight (ALB) and their effects on the frequency of mutations associated with resistance to SDHI (H134R, S135R, and H277Y) and QoI (G143A) fungicides. Treatments consisted of three applications using: Luna Sensation, Regalia, Vacciplant, Luna Sensation + Serenade, Adament, Cevya, Luna Experience, Luna Experience + Serenade, Miravis Duo, Miravis Prime, Merivon, Mibelya. The severity was evaluated using a 0-to-5 rating scale and the frequency of each mutation was determined using qPCR methods. As expected, the non-treated control showed the highest severity scores. Except for Regalia, all fungicide treatments reduced the severity of ALB. The fungicide treatment using Miravis Duo resulted in the lowest severity scores. Six fungicide products showed a similar performance to the above-mentioned treatment. The remaining fungicides showed an intermediate efficacy in controlling the disease. The frequency of mutation H134R was higher on trees sprayed with Miravis Duo, Miravis Prime, Merivon, and Mibelya. Mutations H277Y and S135R showed low frequency values and were not influenced by the fungicide treatment. Regalia, Vacciplant, and Cevya were the only products that did not increase the frequency of mutation G143A. Fungicide products that provide the best control of ALB may increase the frequency of mutants associated with SDHI and QoI resistance. SDHI and QoI fungicides should be used in alternation or combination with other chemical classes to minimize the risk of resistance development.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the management of Alternaria rot in citrus by evaluating the efficacy of late-season fungicide programs in reducing latent infections and fruit drop. Furthermore, the occurrence of mutations conferring resistance to QoI and SDHI fungicides within an Alternaria population isolated from citrus was investigated. In field trials, high frequencies of Alternaria infections were observed on the stem end and stylar end of Satsuma and Shiranui mandarins, with a higher prevalence of stem-end infections. Fungicide treatments applied towards the end of the season effectively reduced the frequency of latent infections on the stem end, indicating that such infections occur during this period under specific conditions. While some fungicide treatments demonstrated efficacy in reducing fruit drop caused by Alternaria rot, the results varied across different orchards and years. Latent infections on fruits persisted at high frequencies in the majority of trials, highlighting the complex nature of disease management. Mutations associated with resistance against QoI and SDHI fungicides were identified within the Alternaria population affecting California citrus. Our study suggests the potential need for fungicide sprays at the onset of the season to reduce the frequency of Alternaria infections on the stem end and stylar end of fruits. However, the observed non-correlation or low correlation between latent infections and fruit drop indicates that latent infections alone cannot reliably predict fruit drop. Our findings indicate that pre-harvest fungicide treatments have inconsistent efficacy and are cost-effective only during unpredictable disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Almond band canker and prune Cytospora canker have become more severe in the last decade, especially in young orchards, in California. To test our hypothesis that young trees from nurseries could carry the canker-causing pathogens at latency phase to new orchards through transplanting, a multiyear survey on latent infection of canker-causing pathogens of budwood and young trees of almond and prune nurseries in California was conducted. A total of more than 1,730 samples including shoots of rootstocks and scions and grafting union cuttings were collected from 11 nurseries. A real-time quantitative PCR assay was applied to quantify the latent infection levels by six canker-causing pathogen taxa: Botryosphaeria dothidea and species of Cytospora, Diplodia, Lasiodiplodia, Neofusicoccum, and Phomopsis. For almond, the average incidences of latent infection caused by Lasiodiplodia spp. (43.6%) and Neofusicoccum spp. (24.2%) were significantly greater than those by the other four pathogen taxa. The molecular severity (MS) of latent infection caused by Neofusicoccum spp. (3.6) was significantly greater than those caused by other pathogen taxa, except for Lasiodiplodia spp. (2.6). For prune, the average incidence of latent infection caused by Cytospora spp. (13.5%) was significantly higher than those caused by B. dothidea (1.5%) and Diplodia spp. (1.3%) but not significantly higher than those caused by Lasiodiplodia spp. (6.9%), Neofusicoccum spp. (6.3%), and Phomopsis spp. (7.7%), respectively. Moreover, the average MS values caused by Cytospora spp. (3.8) and Neofusicoccum spp. (3.2) were the highest followed by those caused by B. dothidea (1.4), Lasiodiplodia spp. (2.2), and Phomopsis spp. (2.3). Different almond varieties showed various levels of susceptibilities to different canker-causing pathogens. This study concluded that Lasiodiplodia and Neofusicoccum are the predominant pathogen species in almond, and Cytospora is the most important canker-causing pathogen species in prune in nurseries. These findings confirmed the observations of predominancy of canker-causing pathogens in almond and prune orchards in California.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the relation between bisphenol A and 14 phthalate metabolites and endometriosis. DESIGN: Matched cohort design. SETTING: Fourteen clinical centers. PATIENT(S): The operative cohort comprised 495 women undergoing laparoscopy/laparotomy, whereas the population cohort comprised 131 women matched on age and residence. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Surgically visualized or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed endometriosis in the two cohorts, respectively. RESULT(S): Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression adjusting for age, body mass index, and creatinine. In the population cohort, six phthalate metabolites-mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono-[(2-carboxymethyl) hexyl] phthalate, mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxyphentyl) phthalate, mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate-were significantly associated with an approximately twofold increase in the odds of an endometriosis diagnosis. Two phthalates were associated with endometriosis in the operative cohort when restricting to visualized and histologic endometriosis (monooctyl phthalate; OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.10-1.72) or when restricting comparison women to those with a postoperative diagnosis of a normal pelvis [mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate; OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.03-1.78]. CONCLUSION(S): Select phthalates were associated with higher odds of an endometriosis diagnosis for women with magnetic resonance imaging-diagnosed endometriosis. The lack of consistency of findings across cohorts underscores the impact of methodology on findings.",

    "issued": "2012-10",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing public health problem among reproductive-aged women, with consequences for chronic disease risk and reproductive and obstetric morbidities. Evidence also suggests that body shape (i.e., regional fat distribution) may be independently associated with risk, yet it is not known if women adequately perceive their shape. This study aimed to assess the validity of self-reported body size and shape figure drawings when compared to anthropometric measures among reproductive-aged women. METHODS: Self-reported body size was ascertained using the Stunkard nine-level figures and self-reported body shape using stylized pear, hourglass, rectangle, and apple figures. Anthropometry was performed by trained researchers. Body size and body mass index (BMI) were compared using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Fat distribution indicators were compared across body shapes for nonobese and obese women using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's exact test. Percent agreement and kappa statistics were computed for apple and pear body shapes. RESULTS: The 131 women studied were primarily Caucasian (81%), aged 32 years, with a mean BMI of 27.1 kg/m(2) (range 16.6-52.8 kg/m(2)). The correlation between body size and BMI was 0.85 (p<0.001). Among nonobese women, waist-to-hip ratios (WHR) were 0.75, 0.75, 0.80, and 0.82 for pear, hourglass, rectangle, and apple, respectively (p<0.001). Comparing apples and pears, the percent agreement (kappa) for WHR≥0.80 was 83% (0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported size and shape were consistent with anthropometric measures commonly used to assess obesity and fat distribution, respectively. Self-reported body shape may be a useful proxy measure in addition to body size in large-scale surveys.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environmental chemicals may be associated with endometriosis. No published research has focused on the possible role of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) despite their widespread presence in human tissues. METHODS: We formulated two samples. The first was an operative sample comprising 495 women aged 18-44 years scheduled for laparoscopy/laparotomy at one of 14 participating clinical sites in the Salt Lake City or San Francisco area, 2007-2009. The second was a population-based sample comprising 131 women matched to the operative sample on age and residence within a 50-mile radius of participating clinics. Interviews and anthropometric assessments were conducted at enrollment, along with blood collection for the analysis of nine PFCs, which were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Endometriosis was defined based on surgical visualization (in the operative sample) or magnetic resonance imaging (in the population sample). Using logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each PFC (log-transformed), adjusting for age and body mass index, and then parity. RESULTS: Serum perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; OR = 1.89 [95% CI = 1.17-3.06]) and perfluorononanoic acid (2.20 [1.02-4.75]) were associated with endometriosis in the operative sample; findings were moderately attenuated with parity adjustment (1.62 [0.99-2.66] and 1.99 [0.91-4.33], respectively). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (1.86 [1.05-3.30]) and PFOA (2.58 [1.18-5.64]) increased the odds for moderate/severe endometriosis, although the odds were similarly attenuated with parity adjustment (OR = 1.50 and 1.86, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Select PFCs were associated with an endometriosis diagnosis. These associations await corroboration.",

Epidemiological dynamics of many infectious diseases have highlighted the importance of considering the demographics of the societies in which they spread, particularly with respect to age structure. In addition, the waves of the recent COVID-19 pandemic driven by variant replacements at an unprecedented speed show that it is vital to consider the evolutionary aspects. The classic trade-off theory of virulence addresses aspects of pathogen evolution, but here we explore in more detail the possibility of society-specific evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) during an unfolding pandemic. Theory posits the existence under some conditions of an ESS representing the evolutionary endpoint of change. By using a demographically realistic model incorporating infection rates that vary with age, we outline which evolutionary scenarios are plausible. Focusing on the rate of infection and duration of infectivity, we ask whether an ESS exists, what characterizes it, and as a result which long-term public-health consequences may be expected. We demonstrate that the ESS of an evolving pathogen depends upon the background age-dependent frailty and mortality rates. Our findings shed important light on the plausible long-term trajectories of highly evolvable novel pathogens.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSpatial-temporal variation in environmental conditions is ubiquitous in nature. This variation simultaneously impacts survival, reproduction, and movement of individuals and thereby the rate at which metapopulations grow. Using the tools of stochastic demography, the metapopulation growth rate is decomposed into five components corresponding to temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal variation in fitness and spatial and spatial-temporal covariation in dispersal and fitness. While temporal variation in fitness always reduces the metapopulation growth rate, all other sources of variation can either increase or reduce the metapopulation growth rate. Increases occur either by reducing the impacts of temporal variation or by generating a positive fitness-density covariance where individuals tend to concentrate in higher-quality patches. For example, positive autocorrelations in spatial-temporal variability in fitness generate this positive fitness-density covariance for less dispersive populations but decrease it for highly dispersive populations (e.g., migratory species). Negative autocorrelations in spatial-temporal variability have the opposite effects. Positive covariances between movement and future fitness, on short or long timescales, increase growth rates. These positive covariances can arise in unexpected ways. For example, the win-stay, lose-shift dispersal strategy in negatively autocorrelated environments can generate positive spatial covariances that exceed negative spatial-temporal covariances. This decomposition of the metapopulation growth rate provides a way to quantify the relative importance of fundamental sources of variation for metapopulation persistence.",

    "abstract": "AbstractClimate change will affect both the mean and the variability in environmental conditions and may have major negative impacts on population densities in the future. For annual plants that already live in an extreme environment like the Sonoran Desert, keeping a fraction of their seeds dormant underground (for possibly years at a time) is critical to survive. Here, we consider how this form of bet hedging (i.e., delayed germination) for 10 Sonoran Desert annuals mediates responses to precipitation shifts. We use a demographic model parameterized with long-term field and precipitation data to explore how forecasted changes in precipitation impact annual plant species' population densities. We then examine how instantaneous evolution of optimal germination fractions in the shifted precipitation regimes bolsters population densities. Our results indicate that overall less rainfall and, to a lesser extent, increased variance in rainfall drive population levels down. Instantaneous evolution of optimal germination fractions in new regimes benefited species' populations only marginally, and only for small to moderate shifts in precipitation. Thus, even rapid evolution is unlikely to save populations experiencing larger shifts in precipitation. Finally, we predict that specialists that can capitalize on wet-year bonanzas or are water use efficient will be the most resilient to precipitation shifts as long as their seed survivorships are sufficiently high.",

    "issued": "2024-02",
    "abstract": "When reproductive success is determined by the relative availabilities of a series of essential, non-substitutable resources, the theory of balanced fitness limitations predicts that the cost of harvesting a particular resource shapes the likelihood that a shortfall of that resource will constrain realized fitness. Plant reproduction through female function offers a special opportunity to test this theory; essential resources in this context include, first, the pollen received from pollinators or abiotic vectors that is used to fertilize ovules, and, second, the resources needed to provision the developing seeds and fruit. For many plants realized reproductive success through female function can be readily quantified in the field, and one key potential constraint on fitness, pollen limitation, can be assessed experimentally by manually supplementing pollen receipt. We assembled a comparative dataset of pollen limitation using only studies that supplement pollen to all flowers produced over the plant's reproductive lifespan. Pre- and post-pollination costs were estimated using the weight of flowers and fruits and estimates of fruit set. Consistent with expectations, we find self-incompatible plants make greater pre-pollination investments and experience greater pollen limitation. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, when variation due to self-compatibility is accounted for by including self-compatibility in the statistical model as a covariate, we find no support for the prediction that plants that invest more heavily in pre-pollination costs are subject to greater pollen limitation. Strong within-species, between-population variation in the expression of pollen limitation makes the quantification of mean pollen limitation difficult. We urge plant ecologists to conduct more studies of pollen limitation using whole-plant pollen supplementation to produce a richer comparative dataset that would support a more robust test of the balanced limitations hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Conditional mutualisms involve costs and benefits that vary with environmental factors, but mechanisms driving these dynamics remain poorly understood. Scatterhoarder-plant interactions are a prime example of this phenomenon, as scatterhoarders can either increase or reduce plant recruitment depending on the balance between seed dispersal and predation. We explored factors that drive the magnitude of net benefits for plants in this interaction using a mathematical model, with parameter values based on European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis). We measured benefits as the percentage of germinating seeds, and examined how varying rodent survival (reflecting, e.g. changes in predation pressure), the rate of seed loss to other granivores, the abundance of alternative food resources, and changes in masting patterns affect the quality of mutualism. We found that increasing granivore abundance can degrade the quality of plant-scatterhoarder mutualism due to increased cache pilferage. Scatterhoarders are predicted to respond by increasing immediate consumption of gathered seeds, leading to higher costs and reduced benefits for plants. Thus, biotic changes that are detrimental to rodent populations can be beneficial for tree recruitment due to adaptive behavior of rodents. When scatterhoarder populations decline too drastically (< 5 individuals ha-1 ); however, tree recruitment may also suffer.",

It argues that US officials used the prison system not only to extract labor, but to structure racial hierarchy and justify expansionist claims to jurisdiction and sovereignty. It reveals how despite the purported “usefulness” of the Black bodies conscripted in this brutal labor regime, the prison system's operational modality was racial and gendered violence which exceeded the registers of political economy, penology, and state-building in which that usefulness was framed. The Canal Zone convict road building scheme then became a cornerstone from which Good Roads Movement boosters, who claimed the convict was a slave of the state, could push for the Pan-American Highway across the hemisphere. Afro-Panamanian and Caribbean workers, who were the majority of those forced into Canal Zone chain gangs, protested the racism and imperialism of the prison system by blending anti-colonial and anti-racist strategies and deploying a positive notion of blackness as solidarity and race pride. Their efforts and insight offer an understanding of the US carceral state's imperial dimensions as well as enduring lessons for movements struggling to broaden the meaning and experience of freedom in the face of slavery's recurrent afterlives.</jats:p>",

    "issued": "2023-08",
    "abstract": "The coordinated (dis)engagement of the membrane-bound T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3-CD4 complex from the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is fundamental to TCR signal transduction and T cell effector function. As such, an atomic-scale understanding would not only enhance our basic understanding of the adaptive immune response but would also accelerate the rational design of TCRs for immunotherapy. In this study, we explore the impact of the CD4 coreceptor on the TCR-pMHC (dis)engagement by constructing a molecular-level biomimetic model of the CD3-TCR-pMHC and CD4-CD3-TCR-pMHC complexes within a lipid bilayer. After allowing the system complexes to equilibrate (engage), we use steered molecular dynamics to dissociate (disengage) the pMHC. We find that 1) the CD4 confines the pMHC closer to the T cell by 1.8 nm at equilibrium; 2) CD4 confinement shifts the TCR along the MHC binding groove engaging a different set of amino acids and enhancing the TCR-pMHC bond lifetime; 3) the CD4 translocates under load increasing the interaction strength between the CD4-pMHC, CD4-TCR, and CD4-CD3; and 4) upon dissociation, the CD3-TCR complex undergoes structural oscillation and increased energetic fluctuation between the CD3-TCR and CD3-lipids. These atomic-level simulations provide mechanistic insight on how the CD4 coreceptor impacts TCR-pMHC (dis)engagement. More specifically, our results provide further support (enhanced bond lifetime) for a force-dependent kinetic proofreading model and identify an alternate set of amino acids in the TCR that dominate the TCR-pMHC interaction and could thus impact the design of TCRs for immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "A feature of severe COVID-19 is the onset of an acute and intense systemic inflammatory response referred to as the \"cytokine storm\". The cytokine storm is characterized by high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent transport of inflammatory cells to damaging levels in vital organs (e.g., myocarditis). Immune trafficking and its effect on underlying tissues (e.g., myocardium) are challenging to observe at a high spatial and temporal resolution in mouse models. In this study, we created a vascularized organ-on-a-chip system to mimic cytokine storm-like conditions and tested the effectiveness of a novel multivalent selectin-targeting carbohydrate conjugate (composed of DS - dermatan sulfate and IkL - a selectin-binding peptide, termed DS-IkL) in blocking infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Our data shows that cytokine storm-like conditions induce endothelial cells to produce additional inflammatory cytokines and facilitate infiltration of PMNs into tissue. Treatment of tissues with DS-IkL (60 μM) reduced PMN accumulation in the tissue by >50%. We then created cytokine storm-like conditions in a vascularized cardiac tissue-chip and found that PMN infiltration increases the spontaneous beating rate of the cardiac tissue, and this effect is eliminated by treatment with DS-IkL (60 μM). In summary, we demonstrate the utility of an organ-on-a-chip platform to mimic COVID-19 related cytokine storm and that blocking leukocyte infiltration with DS-IkL could be a viable strategy to mitigate associated cardiac complications.",

Utilizing microfluidic and stem cell technologies, we present a 3D in vitro model of human bone marrow that contains both the perivascular and endosteal niches, complete with dynamic, perfusable vascular networks. We demonstrate that our model can replicate in vivo bone marrow function, including maintenance and differentiation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, egress of neutrophils (CD66b+), and niche-specific responses to doxorubicin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. Our platform provides opportunities to accelerate current understanding of human bone marrow function and drug response with high spatial and temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells line all major blood vessels and serve as integral regulators of many functions including vessel diameter, cellular trafficking, and transport of soluble mediators. Despite similar functions, the phenotype of endothelial cells is highly organ-specific, yet our understanding of the mechanisms leading to organ-level differentiation is incomplete. We generated 3D microvessel networks by combining a common naïve endothelial cell with six different stromal cells derived from the lung, skin, heart, bone marrow, pancreas, and pancreatic cancer. Single cell RNA-Seq analysis of the microvessel networks reveals five distinct endothelial cell populations, for which the relative proportion depends on the stromal cell population. Morphologic features of the organotypic vessel networks inversely correlate with a cluster of endothelial cells associated with protein synthesis. The organotypic stromal cells were each characterized by a unique subpopulation of cells dedicated to extracellular matrix organization and assembly. Finally, compared to cells in 2D monolayer, the endothelial cell transcriptome from the 3D in vitro heart, skin, lung, and pancreas microvessel networks are more similar to the in vivo endothelial cells from the respective organs. We conclude that stromal cells contribute to endothelial cell and microvessel network organ tropism, and create an endothelial cell phenotype that more closely resembles that present in vivo.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To model pharmacokinetics of three benzodiazepines and their metabolites in sheep. STUDY DESIGN: A nonblinded, prospective, experimental study. ANIMALS: A group of six adult Hampshire-Suffolk cross-bred sheep (three females, three castrated males), 73 ± 3 kg (mean ± standard deviation). METHODS: Remimazolam, midazolam and diazepam were coadministered as an intravenous (IV) bolus to each sheep, and blood was sampled at 18 time points over 10 hours. HPLC-MS/MS was used to simultaneously measure plasma concentrations of the parent benzodiazepines (metabolites) for remimazolam (CNS 7054), midazolam (α-hydroxymidazolam) and diazepam (nordiazepam, temazepam, oxazepam). Concentrations over time for each compound were fit to noncompartmental models using commercial software. Calculated pharmacokinetic parameters were compared using either repeated-measures anova if normally distributed or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests if not. Differences between agents were significant when p < 0.05 after adjustments for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Remimazolam was undetectable in the plasma of all sheep by 3 hours, whereas midazolam and diazepam concentrations were still quantifiable 10 hours after injection. Median (range) clearance rate from plasma was 103 (61-256), 22 (9.6-37) and 38 (20-46) mL kg-1 minute-1 for remimazolam, midazolam and diazepam, respectively. Median (range) terminal elimination half-time was 9.8 (4.6-15), 113 (90-271) and 246 (170-624) minutes for remimazolam, midazolam and diazepam, respectively. Except for temazepam, terminal elimination half-times were generally longer for metabolites than for their parent drug. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Remimazolam elimination is significantly faster than either midazolam or diazepam. The rapid pharmacokinetics of remimazolam may be particularly useful to facilitate fast recovery from sedation and minimize drug residue exposures in food-producing animals.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To screen modulators of biogenic amine (BA) neurotransmission for the ability to cause fentanyl to decrease isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) in cats, and to test whether fentanyl plus a combination of modulators decreases isoflurane MAC more than fentanyl alone. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, experimental study. ANIMALS: A total of six adult male Domestic Short Hair cats. METHODS: Each cat was anesthetized in three phases with a 1 week washout between studies. In phase 1, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane, and MAC was measured in duplicate using a tail clamp stimulus and standard bracketing technique. A 21 ng mL-1 fentanyl target-controlled infusion was then administered and MAC measured again. In phase 2, a single cat was administered a single BA modulator (buspirone, haloperidol, dexmedetomidine, pregabalin, ramelteon or trazodone) in a pilot drug screen, and isoflurane MAC was measured before and after fentanyl administration. In phase 3, isoflurane MAC was measured before and after fentanyl administration in cats co-administered trazodone and dexmedetomidine, the two BA modulator drugs associated with fentanyl MAC-sparing in the screen. Isoflurane MAC-sparing by fentanyl alone, trazodone-dexmedetomidine and trazodone-dexmedetomidine-fentanyl was evaluated using paired t tests with p < 0.05 denoting significant effects. RESULTS: The MAC of isoflurane was 1.87% ± 0.09 and was not significantly affected by fentanyl administration (p = 0.09). In the BA screen, cats administered trazodone or dexmedetomidine exhibited 26% and 22% fentanyl MAC-sparing, respectively. Trazodone-dexmedetomidine co-administration decreased isoflurane MAC to 1.50% ± 0.14 (p < 0.001), and the addition of fentanyl further decreased MAC to 0.95% ± 0.16 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Fentanyl alone does not affect isoflurane MAC in cats, but co-administration of trazodone and dexmedetomidine causes fentanyl to significantly decrease isoflurane requirement.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To measure and model concentrations of the analgesic L-carvone, a natural component of spearmint, over time when administered IM to sheep and to characterize L-carvone's effects on CBCs and clinical biochemistry panels. METHODS: L-carvone formulated as a 50% solution (v/v) in ethanol and propylene glycol was administered at 71.6 mg/kg IM, split between each semitendinosus muscle in 6 sheep. Venous blood was sampled over 24 hours, and plasma was separated by centrifugation. Additional blood was collected for CBC and serum biochemical analysis, and tissues were sampled after euthanasia. L-carvone concentrations in plasma and tissue homogenates were measured using HPLC-MS-MS. Plasma pharmacokinetic data were described using a nonlinear mixed effects model. Complete blood count and biochemistry data were compared to baseline values using repeated-measures ANOVA and Holm-Šidák tests (P < .05). RESULTS: Maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 0.28 to 1.93 µg/mL and occurred within 9 to 15 minutes after injection. Pharmacokinetics were best described using 2 compartments. Elimination half-life was 33.7 minutes and 390.2 minutes in the central and peripheral compartments, respectively. Mild increases in neutrophil count and significant increases in creatinine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase were associated with injection site myonecrosis. No physical examination, behavioral, or other clinically significant laboratory changes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Intramuscular L-carvone exhibits rapid time to peak concentration, relatively slow plasma elimination, and low tissue concentrations after 24 hours. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: L-carvone exhibits a favorable pharmacokinetic profile for an analgesic drug. A new L-carvone formulation or administration route is needed to reduce inflammation and necrosis at the injection site.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of oral pregabalin versus gabapentin on sedation quality and anesthesia recovery times in cats in a typical perioperative setting. ANIMALS: 50 healthy cats with > 1 kg body weight presenting for elective surgery. METHODS: In this randomized, prospective clinical trial, cats presenting to the University of California-Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital were assigned to receive buprenorphine 0.02 mg/kg IM followed by 1 of 2 oral sedation treatments: pregabalin 4 mg/kg or gabapentin 10 mg/kg. Cats were then anesthetized using a standardized protocol. Physical examination parameters and behavioral scores were measured by 2 treatment-blinded veterinarians to compare sedation levels before and after drug administration. Inadequate sedation for handling or IV catheter placement was addressed by dexmedetomidine administration. After surgery was completed, anesthesia recovery times and quality were assessed by the same veterinarians. The effects of pregabalin versus gabapentin on body temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were analyzed using Student t tests; behavioral assessments were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; and drug treatment effects on dexmedetomidine sedation rescue and frequency of delirium during anesthetic recovery were analyzed using Fisher exact tests. A P < .05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in change of physiologic parameters or sedation scores before and after sedation between groups. The need for rescue sedation for IV catheter placement and the incidence of emergence delirium were infrequent and similar for both treatments. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: At the doses studied, oral pregabalin and gabapentin produced indistinguishable effects as adjunctive perioperative sedation agents in cats.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe an ultrasound-guided suprazygomatic approach to the trigeminal nerve block in cat cadavers. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study. ANIMALS: Ten feline cadaver heads. METHODS: A 25:75 methylene blue-iopamidol mixture (0.1 mL cm-1 cranium length) was injected into 10 cadaver heads using an ultrasound-guided suprazygomatic approach. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to identify contrast presence at the orbital fissure, foramen rotundum and ovale, followed by anatomical dissection to identify staining of the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF), extraconal retrobulbar area, mandibular and maxillary nerves. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize results. RESULTS: A total of 20 injections were performed. Of these, 1/20 misinjection occurred and excluded from further reporting. The volume of injectate was 0.9 (0.9-1.1) mL [median (range)]. Staining of the PPF, extraconal space, maxillary and mandibular nerves over more than 6 mm was achieved in 19/19 (100%), 18/19 (95%), 17/19 (89%) and 19/19 (100%) of injections, respectively. CT showed presence of contrast within 5 mm of the orbital fissure, foramen rotundum and ovale in 18/19 (95%), 19/19 (100%) and 19/19 (100%) of the injections, respectively. No intracranial migration was observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This cadaver study illustrates that the suprazygomatic ultrasound-guided trigeminal nerve injection technique can successfully stain the PPF, retrobulbar cone extraconally, mandibular and maxillary nerves. Consequently, this technique has the potential to be used in vivo in cats to desensitize areas innervated by the trigeminal nerve.",

    "issued": "2025-04-30",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pheromones play a key role in regulating sexual behavior throughout the animal kingdom. In Drosophila and other insects, many cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are sexually dimorphic, and some are known to perform pheromonal functions. However, the genetic control of sex-specific CHC production is poorly understood outside of the model species D. melanogaster. A recent evolutionary change is found in D. prolongata, which, compared to its closest relatives, shows greatly increased sexual dimorphism in both CHCs and the chemosensory system responsible for their perception. A key transition involves a male-specific increase in the proportion of long-chain CHCs. RESULTS: Perfuming D. prolongata females with the male-biased long-chain CHCs reduces copulation success, suggesting that these compounds function as sex pheromones. The evolutionary change in CHC profiles correlates with a male-specific increase in the expression of multiple genes involved in CHC biosynthesis, including fatty acid elongases, reductases and other key enzymes. In particular, elongase F, which is responsible for producing female-specific pheromones in D. melanogaster, is strongly upregulated in D. prolongata males compared both to females and to males of the sibling species. Mutations in eloF reduce the amount of long-chain CHCs, resulting in a partial feminization of pheromone profiles in D. prolongata males. Transgenic experiments show that sex-biased expression of eloF is caused in part by a putative transposable element honghaier insertion in its regulatory region. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that cis-regulatory changes in the eloF gene, along with other changes in the CHC synthesis pathway, contribute to the evolution of sexual communication.",

    "abstract": "Across internally fertilising species, males transfer ejaculate proteins that trigger wide-ranging changes in female behaviour and physiology. Much theory has been developed to explore the drivers of ejaculate protein evolution. The accelerating availability of high-quality genomes now allows us to test how these proteins are evolving at fine taxonomic scales. Here, we use genomes from 264 species to chart the evolutionary history of Sex Peptide (SP), a potent regulator of female post-mating responses in Drosophila melanogaster. We infer that SP first evolved in the Drosophilinae subfamily and has since followed markedly different evolutionary trajectories in different lineages. Outside of the Sophophora-Lordiphosa, SP exists largely as a single-copy gene with independent losses in several lineages. Within the Sophophora-Lordiphosa, the SP gene family has repeatedly and independently expanded. Up to seven copies, collectively displaying extensive sequence variation, are present in some species. Despite these changes, SP expression remains restricted to the male reproductive tract. Alongside, we document considerable interspecific variation in the presence and morphology of seminal microcarriers that, despite the critical role SP plays in microcarrier assembly in D. melanogaster, appears to be independent of changes in the presence/absence or sequence of SP. We end by providing evidence that SP's evolution is decoupled from that of its receptor, Sex Peptide Receptor, in which we detect no evidence of correlated diversifying selection. Collectively, our work describes the divergent evolutionary trajectories that a novel gene has taken following its origin and finds a surprisingly weak coevolutionary signal between a supposedly sexually antagonistic protein and its receptor.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a postoperative fracture gap on implant failure following radius and ulna fracture repair in toy breed dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. ANIMALS: A total of 80 client-owned toy breed dogs. METHODS: Medical records and radiographs were reviewed for dogs <3.5 kg that had surgical repair of simple transverse radius and ulna fractures at four institutions from 2005 to 2019. Data collected included signalment, fracture location, implant types and thickness, plate working length, evidence of a postoperative fracture gap in the caudal cortex, postoperative care, occurrence of implant failure, and other complications. The association between potential risk factors and complications was examined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A postoperative fracture gap in the caudal cortex was noted in 37 cases, and 10 cases experienced implant failure. Of the 43 cases without a gap, one case experienced implant failure. After adjusting for other variables, the fracture gap was significantly associated with implant failure (odds ratio = 23.0 [95% confidence interval: 2.7; 197.9], p = .004). Prolonged external coaptation was associated with minor and major complications other than implant failure (p = .04), while the absence of coaptation confounded the effects of the fracture gap on implant failure. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Reduction of the caudal cortex of the radius is imperative to promote bone healing and prevent implant failure in transverse radius and ulna fractures of toy breed dogs.",

The first patient was lame for 2 months following a tumble whilst playing, and the second patient had been intermittently lame since 3 weeks of age. In both cases, radiographic examination of the shoulder revealed fissuring of the caudal humeral head consistent with an incomplete proximal humeral Salter-Harris type IV fracture with an Enoki-mushroom-like appearance of the caudal fragment, where two heads rise from a common stem. There was secondary neoarthrosis of the caudal humeral head fragment with the glenoid rim of the scapula. Humeral head-split fracture is an unusual fracture pattern that rarely occurs in skeletally immature patients, and conservative management appears to result in reasonable short-term outcomes. The role of early detection and surgical intervention remains unknown.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Histologically evaluate damage to rabbit femur after the creation of bicortical 1.5-mm-diameter holes using a standard surgical drill bit, an acrylic drill bit, and a Kirschner wire (K-wire). METHODS: 10 femora (5 pairs) from skeletally mature female intact New Zealand white rabbits were used. The bone diaphyses were divided into 4 locations, systematically undergoing each test (surgical drill bit, acrylic drill bit, K-wire, and intact control). Four pairs were drilled using a mechanical testing machine, and 1 pair was drilled by hand. Cross-sections of the bone were stained en bloc with basic fuchsin for undecalcified histological evaluation. Damaged bone was reported as a percentage of a standardized area and categorized by location (cis- or transcortex), drill contact (entrance or exit of the cortex), and total damage (both cortices). RESULTS: The drilling method (hand vs mechanical testing machine) had no effect on histologic damage, so results were analyzed by combining all data. The K-wire demonstrated the greatest area of cracks/damage compared to both standard surgical and acrylic drill bits, whereas no difference in damage was noted between the 2 drill bits for all variables. CONCLUSIONS: The K-wire and drill bits caused microdamage; K-wire drilling created more microdamage than drill bits. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The rabbit bone cortex is thin and brittle relative to dogs and cats, leading to failure during and after fracture fixation. The clinical failure of rabbit bone is at least partially caused by drill bits or K-wires causing microcracks.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare drilling variables and torsional mechanical properties of rabbit femora after bicortical drilling with a 1.5-mm standard surgical drill bit, acrylic drill bit, and K-wire. SAMPLES: 24 pairs of rabbit femora. METHODS: After drilling under controlled axial displacement rate, each bone was biaxially loaded in compression followed by rapid external torsion to failure. Maximum axial thrust force, maximum drill torque, integral of force and displacement, change in temperature, maximum power spectral density of the torque signal, torque vibration, and torque and angle at the yield and failure points were collected. Pre- and postyield stiffness, yield and failure energies, and postyield energy were calculated. RESULTS: The work required to drill through the cis- and transcortices (integral of force and displacement) was greater for the K-wire, followed by the acrylic and then standard drill bits, respectively. The K-wire demonstrated higher maximum torque than the drill bits at the ciscortex, and the force of drilling was significantly greater. The vibration data was greater with the acrylic and standard drill bits than the K-wire. There was no difference in torsional strength between drilling types. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mechanical differences exist between different drill bits and K-wire and demonstrate that the K-wire is overall more damaging than the surgical drill bit.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic elevation in blood glucose levels, resulting from inadequate insulin production, defective cellular response to extracellular insulin, and/or impaired glucose metabolism. The two main types that account for most diabetics are type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), each with their own pathophysiological features. T1D is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This leads to lack of insulin, a vital hormone for regulating blood sugar levels and cellular glucose uptake. As a result, those with T1D depend on lifelong insulin therapy to control their blood glucose level. In contrast, T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, coupled with a relative insulin deficiency. This form of diabetes is often associated with obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and/or genetic factors, and it is managed with lifestyle changes and oral medications. Animal models play a crucial role in diabetes research. However, given the distinct differences between T1DM and T2DM, it is imperative for researchers to employ specific animal models tailored to each condition for a better understanding of the impaired mechanisms underlying each condition, and for assessing the efficacy of new therapeutics. In this review, we discuss the distinct animal models used in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus research and discuss their strengths and limitations.",

    "abstract": "Tissue deterioration and post-injury infections are the primary cause of skin diseases. Tissue engineering has developed various synthetic and natural polymers to generate bioactive scaffolds that can closely replicate the natural extracellular matrix (ECM). Decellularized tissues have emerged as a potential solution for reconstructing cutaneous lesions due to their ability to preserve the intricate protein structure and provide essential functional domains for cellular differentiation. In this study, we selected bovine pericardium and subjected it to diverse decellularization methods to optimize ECM preservation. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/chitosan (CS) infused with two clinically important antibiotics (colistin and meropenem) was directly electrospun onto the decellularized bovine pericardium (DBPS) to endow the dual-layer scaffold (DBPS-Abs) an antibacterial property. Both DBPS-Abs and DBPS demonstrated a consistent 3D microstructure with interlinked pore networks, minimal degradation, and robust mechanical stability. The DBPS-Abs group exhibited a potent antibacterial effect against standard and clinical strains of Escherichia coli. Moreover, implanting the constructs into full-thickness skin wounds in mice confirmed enhanced wound regeneration in cases treated with DBPS-Abs compared to other groups, observed over a 7- and 21-day post-implantation period. These findings highlight DBPS-Abs as a superior antibacterial wound dressing, requiring further clinical evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Significance: The incidence of diabetes continues to rise throughout the world in an alarming rate. Diabetic patients often develop diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), many of which do not heal. Non-healing DFUs are a major cause of hospitalization, amputation, and increased morbidity. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of impaired healing in DFU is crucial for its management. Recent Advances: This review focuses on the recent advancements on macrophages and neutrophils in diabetic wounds and DFUs. In particular, we discuss diabetes-induced dysregulations and dysfunctions of macrophages and neutrophils. Critical Issues: It is well established that diabetic wounds are characterized by stalled inflammation that results in impaired healing. Recent findings in the field suggest that dysregulation of macrophages and neutrophils plays a critical role in impaired healing in DFUs. The delineation of mechanisms that restore macrophage and neutrophil function in diabetic wound healing is the focus of intense investigation. Future Directions: The breadth of recently generated knowledge on the activity of macrophages and neutrophils in diabetic wound healing is impressive. Experimental models have delineated pathways that hold promise for the treatment of diabetic wounds and DFUs. These pathways may be useful targets for further clinical investigation.",

    "abstract": "Deep skin wounds require grafting with a skin substitute for treatment. Despite many attempts in the development of an affordable and efficient skin substitute, the repair of deep skin wounds still remains challenging. In the current study, we present a 3D sponge composite made from human placenta (a disposable organ) and sodium alginate with exceptional properties for skin tissue engineering applications. Toward this goal, different proportions of alginate (Alg) and decellularized placenta scaffold (DPS) were composited and freeze-dried to generate a 3D sponge with the desired biomechanical and biological features. Comprehensive in vitro, in ovo, and in vivo characterizations were performed to assess the morphology, physical structure, mechanical behaviors, angiogenic potential, and wound healing properties of the composites. Through these analyses, the scaffold with optimal proportions of Alg (50%) and DPS (50%) was found to have superior properties. The optimized scaffold (Alg50/DPS50) was applied to the full-thickness wounds created in rats. Our data revealed that the addition of DPS to the Alg solution caused a significant improvement in the mechanical characteristics of the scaffold. Remarkably, the fabricated composite scaffold exhibited mechanical properties similar to those of native skin tissue. When implanted into the full-thickness wounds, the Alg50/DPS50 composite scaffold promoted angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, and granulation tissue formation, as compared to the group without a scaffold. Overall, our findings underscore the potential value of this hybrid scaffold for enhancing skin wound healing and suggest an Alg50/DPS50 composite for clinical investigations.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic chronic ulcers are plagued with persistent nonresolving inflammation. However, diabetic wound environment early after injury suffers from inadequate inflammatory responses due to reductions in proinflammatory cytokines levels. Diabetic neutrophils have known impairments in bactericidal functions. We hypothesized that reduced bacterial killing by diabetic neutrophils, due to their bactericidal functional impairments, results in reduced bioactive bacterial products, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which in turn contribute to reduced signaling through toll-like receptors, leading to inadequate production of proinflammatory cytokines in infected diabetic wound early after injury. We tested our hypothesis in db/db type 2 obese diabetic mouse wound infection model with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data indicate that despite substantially higher levels of infection, toll-like receptor 4-mediated signaling is reduced in diabetic wounds early after injury owing to reduced bioactive levels of lipopolysaccharide. We further demonstrate that topical treatment with lipopolysaccharide enhances toll-like receptor 4 signaling, increases proinflammatory cytokine production, restores leukocyte trafficking, reduces infection burden, and stimulates healing in diabetic wounds. We posit that lipopolysaccharide may be a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers if it is applied topically after the surgical debridement process, which is intended to reset chronic ulcers into acute fresh wounds.",

    "abstract": "Folate supplementation reduces the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs), birth defects consisting in the failure of the neural tube to form and close. The mechanisms underlying NTDs and their prevention by folate remain unclear. Here we show that folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) is necessary for the formation of neural tube-like structures in human-cell derived neural organoids. FOLR1 knockdown in neural organoids and in Xenopus laevis embryos leads to NTDs that are rescued by pteroate, a folate precursor that is unable to participate in metabolism. We demonstrate that FOLR1 interacts with and opposes the function of CD2-associated protein, molecule essential for apical endocytosis and turnover of C-cadherin in neural plate cells. In addition, folates increase Ca2+ transient frequency, suggesting that folate and FOLR1 signal intracellularly to regulate neural plate folding. This study identifies a mechanism of action of folate distinct from its vitamin function during neural tube formation.",

    "abstract": "The balance between neural stem cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation is paramount for the appropriate development of the nervous system. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is known to sequentially promote cell proliferation and specification of neuronal phenotypes, but the signaling mechanisms responsible for the developmental switch from mitogenic to neurogenic have remained unclear. Here, we show that Shh enhances Ca2+ activity at the neural cell primary cilium of developing Xenopus laevis embryos through Ca2+ influx via transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 3 (TRPC3) and release from intracellular stores in a developmental stage-dependent manner. This ciliary Ca2+ activity in turn antagonizes canonical, proliferative Shh signaling in neural stem cells by down-regulating Sox2 expression and up-regulating expression of neurogenic genes, enabling neuronal differentiation. These discoveries indicate that the Shh-Ca2+-dependent switch in neural cell ciliary signaling triggers the switch in Shh action from canonical-mitogenic to neurogenic. The molecular mechanisms identified in this neurogenic signaling axis are potential targets for the treatment of brain tumors and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Proper cerebral cortical development depends on the tightly orchestrated migration of newly born neurons from the inner ventricular and subventricular zones to the outer cortical plate. Any disturbance in this process during prenatal stages may lead to neuronal migration disorders (NMDs), which can vary in extent from focal to global. Furthermore, NMDs show a substantial comorbidity with other neurodevelopmental disorders, notably autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Our previous work demonstrated focal neuronal migration defects in mice carrying loss-of-function alleles of the recognized autism risk gene WDFY3. However, the cellular origins of these defects in Wdfy3 mutant mice remain elusive and uncovering it will provide critical insight into WDFY3-dependent disease pathology. METHODS: Here, in an effort to untangle the origins of NMDs in Wdfy3lacZ mice, we employed mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM). MADM technology enabled us to genetically distinctly track and phenotypically analyze mutant and wild-type cells concomitantly in vivo using immunofluorescent techniques. RESULTS: We revealed a cell autonomous requirement of WDFY3 for accurate laminar positioning of cortical projection neurons and elimination of mispositioned cells during early postnatal life. In addition, we identified significant deviations in dendritic arborization, as well as synaptic density and morphology between wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous Wdfy3 mutant neurons in Wdfy3-MADM reporter mice at postnatal stages. LIMITATIONS: While Wdfy3 mutant mice have provided valuable insight into prenatal aspects of ASD pathology that remain inaccessible to investigation in humans, like most animal models, they do not a perfectly replicate all aspects of human ASD biology. The lack of human data makes it indeterminate whether morphological deviations described here apply to ASD patients or some of the other neurodevelopmental conditions associated with WDFY3 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our genetic approach revealed several cell autonomous requirements of WDFY3 in neuronal development that could underlie the pathogenic mechanisms of WDFY3-related neurodevelopmental conditions. The results are also consistent with findings in other ASD animal models and patients and suggest an important role for WDFY3 in regulating neuronal function and interconnectivity in postnatal life.",

    "abstract": "Folate is an essential micronutrient required for both cellular proliferation through de novo nucleotide synthesis and epigenetic regulation of gene expression through methylation. This dual requirement places a particular demand on folate availability during pregnancy when both rapid cell generation and programmed differentiation of maternal, extraembryonic, and embryonic/fetal tissues are required. Accordingly, prenatal neurodevelopment is particularly susceptible to folate deficiency, which can predispose to neural tube defects, or when effective transport into the brain is impaired, cerebral folate deficiency. Consequently, adequate folate consumption, in the form of folic acid (FA) fortification and supplement use, is widely recommended and has led to a substantial increase in the amount of FA intake during pregnancy in some populations. Here, we show that either maternal folate deficiency or FA excess in mice results in disruptions in folate metabolism of the offspring, suggesting diversion of the folate cycle from methylation to DNA synthesis. Paradoxically, either intervention causes comparable neurodevelopmental changes by delaying prenatal cerebral cortical neurogenesis in favor of late-born neurons. These cytoarchitectural and biochemical alterations are accompanied by behavioral abnormalities in FA test groups compared with controls. Our findings point to overlooked potential neurodevelopmental risks associated with excessively high levels of prenatal FA intake.",

    "abstract": "Context. Strong gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters has become an essential tool in astrophysics, as it allows one to directly probe the dark matter distribution and study magnified background sources. The precision and reliability of strong lensing models rely heavily on the number and quality of multiple images of background sources with spectroscopic redshifts. Aims. We present an updated strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. Methods. We used JWST's NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model was constrained using Lenstool software. Results. Our new dataset, which we used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts from 111 background sources and includes 95 systems with previously known MUSE redshift and 16 systems (with 46 multiple images) for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Three of the spectroscopic systems were not identified by previous JWST studies. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is more than 20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The derived strong lensing model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of ∼0″52. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. In total, we provide 15 new multiple-image system candidates (with 38 multiple images) not reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly NIRISS, for obtaining spectroscopic redshifts of multiple images. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII] λ3727, [OIII] λλ4959, 5007, and Hα lines at 1≲ zl∼ 3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.",

    "abstract": "We present a new analytical model for the attenuation to Epoch of Reionization (EoR) galaxies by proximate neutral hydrogen gas. Many galaxy spectra in the EoR taken by JWST have shown a flux deficit at wavelengths just redward of the Lyman break, and this has been regarded as resulting from Lyα damping wing absorption by the increasing amount of neutral hydrogen in the line of sight. However, previous attenuation models for the intergalactic medium (IGM) commonly used in photometric redshift template-fitting codes assume that the Lyman break is rather sharp, which leads to systematic overestimation of photometric redshifts at z > 7. In this Letter, we build and empirically calibrate a new attenuation model that takes the increased Lyα damping wing absorption into account. Our model consists of the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to dense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the redshift evolution of H i column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating the model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission curve resolves the photometric redshift bias at z > 7, an improvement that is robust to the choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric catalog used. The new attenuation model can be easily implemented in existing template-fitting codes and significantly improves the photometric redshift performance in the EoR.",

    "abstract": "We present a new sample of 158 galaxies at redshift z > 7.5 selected from deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging of five widely separated sight lines in the CANUCS survey. Two-thirds of the pointings and 80% of the galaxies are covered by 12-14 NIRCam filters, including seven to nine medium bands, providing accurate photometric redshifts and robustness against low-redshift interlopers. A sample of 28 galaxies at z > 7.5 with spectroscopic redshifts shows a low systematic offset and scatter in the difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts. We derive the galaxy UV luminosity function at redshifts 8-12, finding a slightly higher normalization than previously seen with the Hubble Space Telescope at redshifts 8-10. We observe a steeper decline in the galaxy space density from z = 8 to 12 than found by most JWST Cycle 1 studies. In particular, we find only eight galaxies at z > 10 and none at z > 12.5, with no z > 10 galaxies brighter than F277W AB = 28 or M UV = −20 in our unmasked, delensed survey area of 53.4 arcmin2. We attribute the lack of bright z > 10 galaxies in CANUCS compared to GLASS and CEERS to intrinsic variance in the galaxy density along different sight lines. The evolution in the CANUCS luminosity function between z = 8 and 12 is comparable to that predicted by simulations that assume a standard star formation efficiency without invoking any special adjustments.",

Using Lenstool and a combination of archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and MUSE data with new JWST data as constraints, we derive an improved gravitational lensing model and extract magnifications of background galaxies with uncertainties. Using our best fit model, we perform a search for new multiply imaged systems via predicted positions. We report no new multiply imaged systems with identifiable redshifts, likely due to already very deep HST and Spitzer data but confirm a z ∼ 8 multiply imaged system by measuring its redshift with NIRISS and NIRSpec spectra. We find that the overall shape of the critical curve for a source at z = 9.0 is similar to previous models of A370, with small changes. We investigate the z ∼ 8 galaxy with two images observable with an apparent magnitude in the F125W band of 26.0 ± 0.2 and 25.6 ± 0.1. After correcting for the magnifications of the images, 7.4 − 0.3 + 0.5 and 9.4 − 0.4 + 0.5 , we use spectral energy distribution fitting to find an intrinsic stellar mass of log(M */M ⊙) = 7.49 − 0.05 + 0.04 , intrinsic star formation rate of 2.8 − 0.3 + 0.4 M ⊙ yr−1, and M UV of −21.3 − 0.2 + 0.2 , which is close to the knee of the luminosity function at that redshift.

    "abstract": "The epoch of reionization (EoR) progressed through the emission of ionizing photons from galaxies to their local intergalactic medium. In this work, we characterize the dwarf star-forming galaxies as candidates for the source of ionizing photons that drove EoR. We investigate the ionizing properties and star formation histories of star-forming dwarf galaxies at the last stages of EoR at 4.8 < z < 7 using observations from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The magnification due to gravitational lensing allows us to probe large dynamic ranges in stellar mass (2 × 106 ≤ M∗/M ≤ 5 × 109) and ultraviolet (UV) magnitudes (−22.68 ≤ MUV ≤= −15.95). We find a median UV slope β1500 of −2.56 ± 0.23 and the production efficiency of ionizing photons logξion = 25.39 ± 0.6 for the full sample (4.8 < z < 7) with a median stellar mass of 6.3 ± 0.5 × 107 M. We find both β1500 and ξion are marginally correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, indicating a possible greater contribution of dwarf galaxies to the reionization of the Universe. We find that on average, galaxies in our sample are experiencing a recent rise/burst of star formation which translates to a higher scatter in ξion and a large scatter in Hα equivalent widths (EWs). Finally, we investigate the trends of Hα and [O III] + Hβ EWs with UV magnitude and find MUV is correlated between Hα but not with [O III] + Hβ EWs indicating low metallicities and recent burst in the UV faint galaxies.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The concept of patient-provider trust in prenatal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) screening remains unexplored. This concept analysis illuminates the role of trust in prenatal ACE screening to improve patient-provider relationships, increase patient uptake of ACE screening, and ensure that ACE screening is implemented in a strengths-based, trauma-informed way. METHODS: A concept analysis was conducted using the Rodgers' evolutionary method to define the antecedents, attributes, and consequences of this construct. The databases searched were PubMed, PsychInfo, and Scopus between 2010 and 2021. A total of 389 articles were retrieved using the search terms prenatal, adverse childhood experiences screening, adverse childhood experiences, and adverse childhood experiences questionnaire. Included articles for detailed review contained prenatal screening, trauma screening (ACE or other), trust or building trust between patient and health care provider, patient engagement, and shared decision making. Excluded articles were those not in the context of prenatal care and that were exclusively about screening with no discussion about the patient-provider relationship or patient perspectives. A total of 32 articles were reviewed for this concept analysis. RESULTS: We define trust in prenatal ACE screening as a network of evidence-based attributes that include the timing of the screening, patient familiarity with the health care provider, cultural competence, demystifying trauma, open dialogue between the patient and health care provider, and patient comfort and respect. DISCUSSION: This concept analysis elucidates the importance of ACE screening and provides suggestions for establishing trust in the context of prenatal ACE screening. Results give insight and general guidance for health care providers looking to implement ACE screening in a trauma-informed way. Further research is needed to evaluate pregnant patients' attitudes toward ACE screening and how a health care provider's trauma history might influence their care. More inquiry is needed to understand the racial, ethnic, and cultural barriers to ACE screening.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Smokeless tobacco use remains prevalent in rural and medically underserved populations, leading to increased rates of tobacco-related cancers and chronic disease. While access to effective cessation programs is limited, text-based interventions may offer a delivery approach with broad reach. This two-armed randomized control trial (RCT) assessed the efficacy of #EnufSnuff.TXT, a text-based smokeless tobacco cessation intervention, in rural and medically underserved communities. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted a two-arm RCT assessing #EnufSnuff.TXT, a text-based scheduled reduction intervention paired with text-based cessation support messages compared with the modified Enough Snuff intervention comprised of a cessation education booklet and bi-weekly motivational text messages. We recruited participants via social media and surveyed participants at 3 and 6 months post-randomization. The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months. RESULTS: We recruited and randomized 532 participants. At 3 months post-randomization, the quit rate was significantly higher in #EnufSnuff.TXT arm compared to the Enough Snuff arm for intent-to-treat (ITT) cases (29.2% vs. 19.0%, odd ratios [OR] = 1.75, p = .0066). The quit rate at 6 months post-randomization remained higher in #EnufSNuff.TXT compared to Enough Snuff for ITT cases (23.1% vs. 20.9%, OR = 1.14, p = .5384), although no longer significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale text-based cessation clinical trial for individuals in underserved areas who use smokeless tobacco. The #EnufSnuff.TXT intervention performed better in the short term; however, both interventions yielded similar quit rates at 6 months post-randomization. Future research should focus on improving long-term abstinence in the #EnufSNuff.TXT intervention. IMPLICATIONS: Text-based cessation approaches have the potential to increase access to cessation interventions in rural and medically underserved areas and reduce tobacco-related chronic disease morbidity and mortality. Our study shows short-term efficacy from the first-ever randomized controlled trial of a smokeless tobacco cessation intervention, #EnufSnuff.TXT, for rural and medically underserved residents in the United States. Our #EnufSnuff.TXT Intervention offers a scalable solution to reach and provide much-needed access to cessation interventions in medically underserved, rural communities in the United States. This work provides the foundation for further inquiry on augmented text-based approaches to increase cessation in this at-risk group.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) in India is 11%, which is one of the highest rates globally. Existing research on HDPs in India primarily focuses on biological risk factors, with minimal research on how socioecological factors combine to increase risk of HDPs. We conducted a rapid review using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model to understand the social and cultural factors associated with HDPs among Indian pregnant women to identify possible intervention targets that may uniquely improve health in this population. Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model is a framework that can be used to understand the complex relationship between multiple influences on health. METHODS: We reviewed studies published between January 2010 and January 2024 using PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. Search terms included variants of hypertension, pregnancy, and India. Inclusion criteria were: (1) peer-reviewed journal article; (2) published between January 2010 to January 2024; (3) participants consisted of Indian women living in India; (4) studies evaluated socioecological risk factors associated with HDPs. One independent reviewer performed searches, screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. Each included study was then organized within Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model. RESULTS: A total of 921 studies were generated from the initial search, with 157 exclusions due to duplicates. Following screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria at the title/abstract and full text levels, 17 studies remained in the final review. Socioecological risk factors of HDPs were identified at each level, with the most commonly identified influences including: low socioeconomic status (SES), lacking community education and knowledge on HDP management and prevention, and lacking prenatal HDP screening. CONCLUSION: This study determined that the high risk for HDPs in India is influenced by many intertwined socioecological factors. Women in rural and low SES areas need more health education on HDP management and prevention. There also needs to be more adequate prenatal HDP screening, with at least 4 and ideally 8 prenatal visits. Prenatal screenings should be accompanied with culturally appropriate patient education, especially for low SES women who have limited literacy, so that they can effectively make individual and microsystemic lifestyle decisions aimed at either managing or preventing HDPs.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Researchers and public health professionals need to better understand individual engagement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation behaviors to reduce the human and societal costs of the current pandemic and prepare for future respiratory pandemics. We suggest that developing measures of individual mitigation behaviors and testing them among high-risk individuals, including pregnant people, may help to reduce overall morbidity and mortality by quickly identifying targets for messaging around mitigation until sufficient vaccination uptake is reached. METHODS: We surveyed pregnant people in California over 2 waves of the COVID-19 pandemic to explore mitigation behaviors. We developed and validated a novel Viral Respiratory Illness Mitigation Scale (VRIMS). RESULTS: Seven measures loaded onto a single factor with good psychometric properties. The overall sample scale average was high over both waves, indicating that most pregnant Californians engaged in most of the strategies most of the time. Older participants, minoritized participants, those living in more urban contexts, and those surveyed during a surge reported engaging in these strategies most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and researchers should consider using reliable, validated measures like the VRIMS to identify individuals and communities that may benefit from additional education on reducing risk for COVID-19, future respiratory pandemics, or even seasonal flu.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy is a time of increased vulnerability to mental health disorders. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of depression and anxiety. Thus, we aimed to assess mental health and associated healthy behaviors of pregnant people in California during the pandemic in order to contextualize prenatal well-being during the first pandemic of the twenty-first century. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study of 433 pregnant people from June 6 through July 29, 2020. We explored 3 hypotheses: (1) mental health would be worse during the pandemic than in general pregnant samples to date; (2) first-time pregnant people would have worse mental health; and (3) healthy behaviors would be positively related to mental health. RESULTS: Many of our participants (22%) reported clinically significant depressive symptoms and 31% reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms. Multiparous pregnant people were more likely to express worries about their own health and wellbeing and the process of childbirth than were primiparous pregnant people. Additionally, as pregnancy advanced, sleep and nutrition worsened, while physical activity increased. Lastly, anxious-depressive symptomology was significantly predictive of participant sleep behaviors, nutrition, and physical activity during the past week. DISCUSSION: Pregnant people had worse mental health during the pandemic, and this was associated with worse health-promoting behaviors. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated risks are likely to persist due to low vaccination rates and the emergence of variants with high infection rates, care that promotes mental and physical well-being for the pregnant population should be a public health priority.",

The progressive shortening of steady-state telomere length in normal human somatic cells is a promising biomarker for age-associated diseases. However, there remain substantial challenges in quantifying telomere length due to the lack of high-throughput method with nucleotide resolution for individual telomere. Here, we describe a workflow to capture telomeres using newly designed telobaits in human culture cell lines as well as clinical patient samples and measure their length accurately at nucleotide resolution using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. Our results also reveal the extreme heterogeneity of telomeric variant sequences (TVSs) that are dispersed throughout the telomere repeat region. The presence of TVSs disrupts the continuity of the canonical (5'-TTAGGG-3')n telomere repeats, which affects the binding of shelterin complexes at the chromosomal ends and telomere protection. These findings may have profound implications in human aging and diseases.",

    "abstract": "The shelterin protein TPP1 is involved in both recruiting telomerase and stimulating telomerase processivity in human cells. Assessing the in vivo significance of the latter role of TPP1 has been difficult, because TPP1 mutations that perturb telomerase function tend to abolish both telomerase recruitment and processivity. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase-associated Est3 protein adopts a protein fold similar to the N-terminal region of TPP1. Interestingly, a previous structure-guided mutagenesis study of Est3 revealed a TELR surface region that regulates telomerase function via an unknown mechanism without affecting the interaction between Est3 and telomerase [T. Rao et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 111, 214-218 (2014)]. Here, we show that mutations within the structurally conserved TELR region on human TPP1 impaired telomerase processivity while leaving telomerase recruitment unperturbed, hence uncoupling the two roles of TPP1 in regulating telomerase. Telomeres in cell lines containing homozygous TELR mutations progressively shortened to a critical length that caused cellular senescence, despite the presence of abundant telomerase in these cells. Our findings not only demonstrate that telomerase processivity can be regulated by TPP1 in a process separable from its role in recruiting telomerase, but also establish that the in vivo stimulation of telomerase processivity by TPP1 is critical for telomere length homeostasis and long-term viability of human cells.",

    "abstract": "The shelterin protein complex protects natural chromosome ends from being recognized as DNA damage sites and also regulates the synthesis of telomeric repeats by telomerase. TPP1, a shelterin subunit that is essential for telomerase extension of telomeres, has been studied intensively in recent years. Many such studies utilize epitope tagged TPP1, but it is unclear how the tags may affect the multiple cellular functions of TPP1. Here we analyzed the effect of adding a 3x Flag epitope tag to the N- or C-terminus of TPP1. While the position of the tag did not affect TPP1's interaction within the shelterin complex or its localization to telomeres, the N-terminal Flag tag on TPP1 impaired telomerase function, resulting in reduced telomerase processivity in vitro and a failure to stimulate telomere elongation in vivo. The C-terminally Flag-tagged TPP1, in contrast, behaved similarly to untagged TPP1 in all functional aspects examined. These findings suggest that caution is required when utilizing epitope tagged TPP1 to study its regulation of telomerase function.",

    "abstract": "The double-stranded telomeric binding protein TRF2 is expressed in many human cancers at elevated levels. Moreover, experimental overexpression of TRF2 in human cells causes replication stalling in telomeric tracts, which leads to drastic telomere shortening and fusion of deprotected chromosome ends. To understand which end joining pathway is involved in mediating these chromosome fusions, we overexpressed TRF2 in human HCT116 cell lines that were deficient for the DNA Ligase 4 (Lig4)-dependent classical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) or the DNA Ligase 3 (Lig3)-dependent alternative non-homologous end joining (A-NHEJ) pathway. Surprisingly, abrogation of either Lig4 or nuclear Lig3 significantly reduced inter-chromosomal fusion of drastically shortened telomeres, suggesting that both the C-NHEJ and A-NHEJ pathways are involved in mediating this type of fusion. Fusion between deprotected sister chromatids, however, only required the Lig3-dependent A-NHEJ pathway. Interestingly, a previous study reported similar end joining pathway requirements for the fusion of critically shortened telomeres during a telomere attrition-based cellular crisis. We speculate that, as in cellular crisis, the same repair pathway(s) may drive clonal and genomic evolution in human cancers containing elevated TRF2 levels.",

Experimental overexpression of TRF2 has also been shown to induce telomere shortening, through an unknown mechanism. Here we report that TRF2 overexpression results in replication stalling in duplex telomeric repeat tracts and the subsequent formation of telomeric ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs), ultimately leading to stochastic loss of telomeric sequences. These TRF2 overexpression-induced telomere deletions generate chromosome fusions resembling those detected in human cancers and in mammalian cells containing critically shortened telomeres. Therefore, our findings have uncovered a second pathway by which altered TRF2 protein levels can induce end-to-end fusions. The observations also provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of genomic instability in tumour cells containing significantly increased TRF2 levels.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Untreated early-onset scoliosis (EOS) is often complicated by decreased thoracic expansion growth and pulmonary complications. Various fusion-less techniques have been developed to address these complications, including growing rods and vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) devices. To achieve adequate spinal growth, optimal lengthening timing is required. Yet, there are no evidence-based guidelines for these intervals. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes concerning the distraction intervals of surgically untreated EOS patients who underwent VEPTR treatment with a minimum 5-year follow-up. METHODS: We conducted a multicentered retrospective review of EOS patients managed with VEPTR and grouped them as those patients who underwent lengthening procedures in intervals of ≤8 months throughout 5 years (ie, group 1) and those who were lengthened in intervals >8 months during the same time frame (ie, group 2). The 8-month average interval cutoff was chosen following the findings of Yang and colleagues. We compared demographic variables, radiographic parameters, pulmonary function tests, 24-item Early Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ) findings, and complication rates between both groups. RESULTS: Our study included 447 patients (158 in group 1 and 289 in group 2) with similar preoperative baseline characteristics. Postoperatively, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups regarding the coronal and sagittal major curve magnitudes, spine height gains (ie, T1-T12, L1-S1, and T1-S1), and the 24-EOSQ results. However, group 1 had a higher postoperative complication rate (P=0.034) than group 2. CONCLUSIONS: More frequent lengthening intervals were associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimal timing of these intervals among patients with EOS and their association with the outcomes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prune belly syndrome (PBS) is a rare condition characterized by absence of abdominal musculature, cryptorchidism, and obstructive uropathy. The most common orthopaedic problem is scoliosis, yet no reports on growth-friendly surgical treatment of early-onset scoliosis (EOS) exist. Our purpose was to evaluate outcomes of distraction-based implants in children with PBS. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective review. Children with PBS treated with TGR, MCGR, or VEPTR with a minimum 2-year follow-up were identified. Demographics, radiographic/surgical data, complications, and unplanned returns to the operating room (UPROR) were collected. Quality of life was measured using EOSQ-24. RESULTS: Seven patients (100% male) were identified. The mean age at index surgery was 5.6 years. The mean length of follow-up was 4 years (range: 2 to 11 y). Implant types included MCGR (4 patients), TGR (2 patients), and VEPTR (1 patient). Two patients had pelvic fixation. The mean major curve magnitude was 87 degrees preindex, 47 degrees postindex, and 53 degrees at the last follow-up. Mean kyphosis was 55 degrees preindex, 25 degrees postindex, and 42 degrees at the most recent follow-up. Mean T1-T12 and T1-S1 lengths increased 4.4 and 4.8 cm, respectively, between preindex and last follow-up.Complications occurred in 3 patients. One patient had 3 TGR breakages resulting in 3 UPRORs to revise the rods and 1 superficial wound infection treated with antibiotics. Another patient was readmitted for respiratory failure after TGR lengthening and a third patient had a superficial infection manifested by incisional swelling after MCGR insertion that resolved with antibiotics. Two patients have undergone definitive fusion and 1 patient has retained his TGR definitively. The other patients are still undergoing rod lengthening. CONCLUSIONS: Children with PBS can develop severe scoliosis at a young age. Distraction-based implants can successfully control scoliosis while allowing spinal growth. The complication rate is comparable to patients with idiopathic EOS treated with growth-friendly implants. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level IV.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of implementing a standardized opioid prescription protocol on prescription practices post-elective ACS surgery at a large academic institute. METHODS: A prospective cohort study with a retrospective control group was conducted following institutional review board approval. A standardized protocol was created and implemented which specified opioid prescriptions post-surgery. Data on opioid doses, total and daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents requirements, and the need for refills were collected and compared between both cohorts. RESULTS: The study included 83 patients in the post-protocol cohort compared with 315 age- and sex-matched patients in the pre-protocol cohort. The postprotocol cohort received markedly lower daily and total doses at discharge compared with the preprotocol group (P < 0.01). No increase was observed in prescription refills before the initial follow-up in the postprotocol cohort (P = 0.35). At 12 weeks postsurgery, fewer patients in the postprotocol group remained on opioids compared with the preprotocol group (P = 0.14). CONCLUSION: Standardizing opioid prescriptions post-ACS surgery effectively reduces opioid doses prescribed without increasing refill rates. The findings support the efficacy of procedure-specific opioid prescription guidelines in reducing unnecessary opioid use and associated health and economic burdens.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Undiagnosed cervical spine stenosis is a risk factor for central cord syndrome (CCS), especially in vulnerable individuals. Social determinants of health (SDOH) are correlated with health outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize the sociodemographic characteristics and outcomes in surgically-treated central cord syndrome (CCS) patients, and explore potential associations between them. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of surgically-treated CCS patients at a Level-1 trauma center between 2015 and 2021. Patient demographics, radiological findings, and clinical outcomes were collected. SDOH were estimated using the Social Deprivation Index (SDI) and Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Descriptive statistics and regression analyses assessed associations between SDI/ADI, demographics and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of 56 patients, 75 % were insured by Medicare/Medicaid and 70 % were discharged to care facilities. Mean SDI was 66.4 ± 24.4, and mean ADI was 7.4 ± 2.2. Three patients required reoperation for post-operative complications. Post-operative neurologic outcomes varied, with 60.7 % stable, 30.4 % improved, and 8.9 % declined. While SDI/ADI did not correlate with outcomes, higher ADI quartiles were associated with decreased likelihood of home discharge (p = 0.048). Decline in neurologic function was associated with Medicare/Medicaid or Military insurance (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that CCS patients typically come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, as indicated by high SDI and ADI scores. Despite this, we did not find significant correlations between SDI or ADI with post-operative outcomes, and most patients had stable or improved neurological function post-surgery in our cohort. Future studies with larger sample sizes will provide a more comprehensive understanding of these findings.",

Patients were categorized into 3 groups: No Urinalysis (No-UA), Negative Urinalysis (Negative-UA), and Positive Urinalysis (Positive-UA). A retrospective review of medical records was conducted including patient characteristics and clinical factors of interest. Emergency department (ED) visits and return to the operating room (OR) within 3-months postoperatively were recorded. Statistical analyses were performed using bivariate and multivariate analysis.ResultsA total of 493 patients were included. Despite having higher rates of preoperative antibiotics administered, patients with a positive urinalysis were significantly more likely to present with postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs) than the No-UA and Negative-UA groups. No significant differences were seen in other types of complications including pneumonia, bacteremia, superficial wound infections, deep wound infections, and wound dehiscence between the 3 groups. Additionally, rates of return to OR, return to ED, reinsertion of foley catheters, duration of indwelling catheterization, and hospital length of stay had no significant differences between the groups.ConclusionThis study suggests there may be a limited role in performing routine preoperative urinalysis prior to ELFS. This study may help further improve preoperative assessment guidelines and assist with patient counseling and considerations prior to elective lumbar fusion surgery.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, studies have demonstrated that urban and nonurban wildlife populations exhibit differences in foraging behavior and diet. However, little is known about how environmental heterogeneity shapes dietary variation of organisms within cities. We examined the vertebrate prey components of diets of coyotes (Canis latrans) in San Francisco to quantify territory- and individual-level dietary differences and determine how within-city variation in land cover and land use affects coyote diet. We genotyped fecal samples for individual coyote identification and used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition and individual niche differentiation. The highest contributor to coyote diet overall was anthropogenic food followed by small mammals. The most frequently detected species were domestic chicken, pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), domestic pig, and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Diet composition varied significantly across territories and among individuals, with territories explaining most of the variation. Within territories (i.e., family groups), the amount of dietary variation attributed to among-individual differences increased with green space and decreased with impervious surface cover. The quantity of anthropogenic food in scats also was positively correlated with impervious surface cover, suggesting that coyotes consumed more human food in more urbanized territories. The quantity of invasive, human-commensal rodents in the diet was positively correlated with the number of food services in a territory. Overall, our results revealed substantial intraspecific variation in coyote diet associated with urban landscape heterogeneity and point to a diversifying effect of urbanization on population diet.",

    "abstract": "Spatial mark-recapture abundance estimates obtained from fecal genotyping are becoming an essential component of conservation of carnivores. The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a widespread carnivore in California, USA, that until recently lacked robust demographic data. To facilitate a statewide abundance study, we created a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping panel for individual identification. For SNP discovery, we performed restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) on 78 samples collected throughout California and subsequently designed a panel of 96 SNPs for sequencing on a microfluidic platform. This panel includes loci to identify sex and differentiate bobcats from other common carnivores. The panel reliably differentiates individuals when using DNA extracted from feces, with 89% of samples amplifying at > 90% of SNPs. Importantly, we found autosomal SNPs were monomorphic in the closely related Canada lynx (L. canadensis) suggesting the panel would still be effective for bobcat study in areas of sympatry. Fecal genotyping provides a cost-effective, noninvasive method for population monitoring and detecting individual movement. Our panel generates standardized genotypes that can be analyzed across laboratories and used for continued bobcat monitoring in California and other western states.",

    "abstract": "Coastal wetland ecosystems support unique biodiversity and are imminently threatened by climate change-driven sea level rise. However, the impact of climate change on their demographic and evolutionary histories is poorly understood. To improve our understanding, we examined how past climatic events have shaped the evolutionary history of the salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris), an endangered species and a salt marsh habitat specialist, completely restricted to coastal wetlands in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). We used whole mitochondrial genome sequences of 102 salt marsh harvest mice to characterize phylogeography and demographic history. Then, we predicted the ancient distribution of salt marsh habitat and examined correspondence between divergence, demographic history, and changes in ancient marsh habitat caused by sea level rise. A Bayesian Skyline Plot revealed demographic expansions during periods of sea level rise, particularly during the formation of the modern SFE (~ 10 kya), and rapid decline consistent with recent anthropogenic landscape change. Bayesian estimates of divergence time were consistent with subspecies divergence ~ 10 kya, and subpopulation divergence ~ 5 kya, consistent with multiple episodes of vicariance caused by Holocene sea level rise. Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variance and ΦST revealed a mismatch between the morphological and molecular subspecies assignment of two populations. Our study implicates sea level rise as a force of demographic change and evolutionary divergence in coastal marsh ecosystems. Our study also aids conservation of an endangered species by clarifying genetic subspecies boundaries and highlighting the unique nature of isolated populations that are increasingly threatened by modern sea level rise.",

    "abstract": "Live capture-recapture is often considered the gold standard for estimating wildlife population size or density, but the approach can be limited by permitting requirements, required labor, welfare concerns, and biased estimates resulting from heterogeneity in individual behavior. Noninvasive genetic sampling (e.g., from fecal pellets) offers a powerful alternative approach, but this method’s success varies among taxa, with little research available on its use in rodents. Here, we addressed a series of questions to develop a noninvasive genetic sampling approach for the endangered giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens): (1) how quickly does DNA degrade in natural conditions, (2) how many pellets are required to recover a genotype, (3) how often do multiple individuals contaminate a pooled sample from a single sampling location, and (4) how do variable and parameter estimates from noninvasive genetic sampling compare to live-trapping mark-recapture estimates? We found that fecal pellets were successfully genotyped up to 9 days (estimated probability of recovery = 0.78) after exposure to hot, arid conditions, but that rate fell precipitously soon after. Although giant kangaroo rats are territorial, multiple individuals deposited fecal pellets at the same sampling locations; however, single pellets contained sufficient DNA to recover genotypes and to identify individuals, so contamination was not a problem for this approach. Capture probabilities were lower using noninvasive genetic sampling (= 0.26, SE = 0.01) than live trapping (= 0.40, SE = 0.06). Population estimates were generally similar using noninvasive genetic sampling, although they were quite a bit higher (= 64, = 38) on one grid. Noninvasive genetic sampling can overcome many of the limitations of live-trapping for small mammals, but the approach should be tested in additional taxa and systems to provide more generalizable recommendations for sampling schemes.",

    "abstract": "California, USA, is home to 3 subspecies of North American elk (Cervus canadensis): Roosevelt (C. c. roosevelti), Rocky Mountain (C. c. nelsoni), and tule (C. c. nannodes). Effective management requires a baseline understanding of each subspecies' range, admixture zones, and geographic patterns of genetic diversity. To address these questions, we genotyped 1,271 individual elk from California (n = 1,204) and reference populations of Rocky Mountain and Roosevelt elk from Nevada (n = 32) and Oregon (n = 35), USA. Using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, we detected admixture between Roosevelt and Rocky Mountain elk at a contact zone in northern California, and between Roosevelt and tule elk in north-coastal California and central-coastal California. We identified a genetically distinct population of Roosevelt elk in northwestern California, likely reflecting the remnant population that survived a large demographic decline from overhunting during the 1800s. Tule elk exhibited lower levels of heterozygosity (0.44 ± 0.03 [SD]) and allelic richness (2.9 ± 0.2) than Rocky Mountain (0.58 ± 0.05, 4.9 ± 0.4, respectively) and Roosevelt (0.50 ± 0.06, 4.4 ± 0.6, respectively) elk. Among tule elk populations, heterozygosity varied, with the lowest heterozygosity (0.23 ± 0.05) corresponding to the oldest enclosed herd used over the past century as a source of translocations. Among tule elk populations, genetic structure revealed several cases of successful and unsuccessful reintroduction or augmentation attempts. Results provide an essential baseline for future monitoring and decisions about harvest management, translocations to preserve genetic diversity, and landscape-level conservation planning to maintain, enhance, or obstruct connectivity of elk populations. Genome-wide sequencing and analyses are needed to quantify inbreeding absolutely and assess genetic load and the age of admixture where subspecies currently exchange genes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When selecting surgical residents, programs emphasize quantifiable data from the Electronic Residency Application Service application. However, it is unclear whether Electronic Residency Application Service data are associated with future resident performance or any of the qualities (surgical judgment, leadership, and medical knowledge) that our group has identified as being predictive of graduate performance. Our objective was to determine whether residency application variables are associated with subsequent residency graduate performance as rated by surgical educators. METHODS: Faculty from 12 general surgery residency programs rated graduates from 2017 to 2020 on 4 outcomes: overall performance, surgical judgment, leadership, and medical knowledge. Graduates' Electronic Residency Application Service data were collected, including medical school type, United States Medical Examination scores, honors society memberships, extracurriculars, clerkship honors, and class rank. Data were analyzed using the Spearman rank-order correlation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was performed to select a model predictive of each outcome from preresidency variables. RESULTS: A total of 258 graduates were evaluated. Regarding overall residency graduate performance rating, there were weak associations with the United States Medical Examination step 2 score (r = 0.23, P < .01); honors in family medicine (r = 0.17, P = .02), obstetrics/gynecology (r = 0.17, P = .01), pediatrics (r = 0.15, P = .02), and surgery (r = 0.14, P = .03); proportion of clerkship honors (r = 0.2, P < .01); and class rank (r = 0.18, P = .03). None of the preresidency variables were selected for a predictive model via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for any of the 4 outcomes measured. CONCLUSION: There is a weak correlation between measurable residency application data and subsequent resident performance as rated by surgical educators. On least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, no residency application variables were predictive of graduate performance. These findings question the value of measurable application data in resident selection and highlight the importance of cultivating outstanding surgeons throughout training.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether participation in certain hobbies (e.g., participation in sports, playing musical instruments, or other hobbies requiring fine motor skills), preresidency, are associated with higher technical skills ratings at the time of residency graduation. DESIGN: Faculty members from 14 general surgery residency programs scored individual graduates from 2017 to 2020 on their technical skills using a 5-point Likert scale. Hobbies for these residents were collected from their Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) data. A single reviewer classified each ERAS hobby into predefined categories including musical instruments, sports requiring hand-eye coordination, team sports, and activities necessitating hand-eye coordination. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between each category of hobby-as well as the total number of hobbies in each category-and the outcome of surgical faculty ratings of residents' technical surgical skills during their last year of residency. A proportional odds model including the above predictive variables was also fit to the data. SETTING: Fourteen general surgery residency programs. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residency graduates from 14 different programs from 2017 to 2020. RESULTS: There were 296 residents across 14 institutions. The average ranking of residents' technical skills was 3.24 (SD 1.1). A total of 40% of residents played sports involving hand-eye coordination, 31% played team sports, 28% participated in nonsport hobbies that require eye-hand coordination, and 20% played musical instruments. Correlation coefficients were not statistically significant for any of the categories. In the proportional odds model, none of the variables were associated with statistically significant increased odds of a higher technical skills rating. CONCLUSIONS: There was no correlation between general surgery chief residents' technical skills as rated by faculty, and self-reported pre-residency hobbies on the ERAS application. These findings suggest such hobbies prior to residency are unlikely to predict future technical skills prowess.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: It is uncertain whether current measures of achievement during medical school predict exceptional performance during surgical residency. One surrogate of excellence during residency may be awards, especially those given for teaching and annual overall accomplishment. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether markers of superior performance during medical school documented in the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) application and student record correlated with receiving awards during residency. DESIGN: Data was analyzed from ERAS and student applications of 296 residency graduates. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated. PARTICIPANTS: 296 residency graduates from 14 US general surgery residency programs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASUREMENTS: The relationship between each residency and preresidency variable and the outcome of receiving any qualifying award. Secondary analysis included the correlation with winning a teaching or annual overall award. RESULTS: Although 140 (48%) residents received an award during residency, only 69 (23.3%) received a teaching award, while 50 (17.6%) received one for annual overall performance. Membership in Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) and honors in pediatrics rotation correlated with receiving any award. USMLE step 1 score and AOA membership reached statistically significant positively correlation with receiving a teaching award, while completing a sub-internship at that institution was negatively associated. For annual overall awards, only completing a sub-internship at the same institution reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: None of the traditional metrics in the ERAS or global student record consistently correlated with receiving an award during residency. Our findings suggest that preresidency factors available on the global application, including grades, test scores, and honor society membership, poorly correlate with exceptional general surgery residency performance as measured by receiving awards. Residency programs should shift away from using traditional ERAS metrics as the primary criteria for selection, but rather as 1 component of holistic applicant review.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To gather validity evidence supporting the use and interpretation of scores from the American College of Surgeons Entering Resident Readiness Assessment (ACS ERRA) Program. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: ACS ERRA is an online formative assessment program developed to assess entering surgery residents' ability to make critical clinical decisions, and includes 12 clinical areas and 20 topics identified by a national panel of surgeon educators and residency program directors. METHODS: Data from 3 national testing administrations of ACS ERRA (2018-2020) were used to gather validity evidence regarding content, response process, internal structure (reliability), relations to other variables, and consequences. RESULTS: Over the 3 administrations, 1975 surgery residents participated from 125 distinct residency programs. Overall scores [Mean = 64% (SD = 7%)] remained consistent across the 3 years ( P = 0.670). There were no significant differences among resident characteristics (gender, age, international medical graduate status). The mean case discrimination index was 0.54 [SD = 0.15]. Kappa inter-rater reliability for scoring was 0.87; the overall test score reliability (G-coefficient) was 0.86 (Ф-coefficient = 0.83). Residents who completed residency readiness programs had higher ACS ERRA scores (66% versus 63%, Cohen's d = 0.23, P < 0.001). On average, 15% of decisions made (21/140 per test) involved potentially harmful actions. Variability in scores from graduating medical schools (7%) carried over twice as much weight than from matched residency programs (3%). CONCLUSIONS: ACS ERRA scores provide valuable information to entering surgery residents and surgery program directors to aid in development of individual and group learning plans.",

    "abstract": "Canine distemper is a severe and lethal viral disease of dogs and wild carnivores with an urgent need for the identification of effective antiviral agents against canine distemper virus (CDV). We assessed multiple agents for their ability to block the replication of three different lineages of CDV isolated from wild carnivores in the United States. Six antiviral compounds were selected after preliminary experiments that excluded ribavirin, hesperidin and rutin: a protease inhibitor (nirmatrelvir), a polymerase inhibitor (favipiravir) and four nucleoside analogs (remdesivir, GS-441524, EIDD2801 and EIDD1931). Antiviral efficacy was determined by the attenuation of the cytopathic effect in a CDV-susceptible cell line and the inhibition of viral RNA replication. The nucleoside analog GS-441524 effectively blocked the replication of CDV at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Four other antiviral agents inhibited CDV replication to a lesser degree (remdesivir, nirmatrelvir, EIDD2801 and EIDD1931). The replication of different viral lineages was differentially inhibited by the antivirals. Several of the nucleoside analogs have been safely used previously in carnivore species for the treatment of other viral diseases, suggesting that they may be promising candidates for the treatment of canine distemper in dogs. Our results emphasize the need to consider different viral lineages in the screening of antiviral compounds.",

    "abstract": "A 14-year-old Warmblood gelding presented for septic arthritis of the tarsocrural joint and tarsometatarsal joint post corticosteroid injection. Both joints were treated with arthroscopic and needle lavage, respectively. Additional treatments included systemic antimicrobials, intravenous regional limb perfusions and intra-articular antimicrobials. Walking comfort significantly decreased 9 days post joint lavage. Persistent synovial infection was confirmed through repeat arthrocentesis, necessitating a second arthroscopic lavage. Progressive sclerosis of the central tarsal bone was observed on consecutive radiographs of the right tarsus. Given the clinical deterioration advanced diagnostic imaging using 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. The images revealed loss of blood supply and severe sclerosis of part of the central tarsal bone, consistent with potential devitalized bone. The horse was humanely euthanised. Histopathology confirmed necrotic and sclerotic bone in the dorsomedial aspect of the central tarsal bone. It is hypothesised that the septic arthritis led to inflammation-associated bone infarction and necrosis of the central tarsal bone. Clinicians should be aware of possible bone necrosis in the central tarsal bone of equine patients, presented for chronic septic arthritis. This report highlights the value in the use of 18F-NaF PET and MRI for early identification of osteonecrosis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a third-generation lentivirus-based vector encoding the feline erythropoietin (EPO) (feEPO) gene in vitro and in rodent models in vivo. This vector incorporates a genetic mechanism to facilitate the termination of the therapeutic effect in the event of supraphysiologic polycythemia, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) \"suicide gene.\" ANIMALS: CFRK cells and replication-defective lentiviral vectors encoding feEPO were used for in vitro experiments. Eight Fischer rats were enrolled in the pilot in vivo study, 24 EPO-deficient mice were used in the initial mouse study, and 15 EPO-deficient mice were enrolled in the final mouse study. METHODS: Efficacy of a third-generation lentivirus encoding feEPO was determined in vitro using western blot assays. Subsequently, in a series of rodent experiments, animals were administered the viral vector in progressively increasing inoculation doses with serial measurements of blood packed cell volume (PCV) over time. RESULTS: We documented production of feEPO protein in transduced CRFK cells with subsequent cessation of production when treated with the HSV-TK substrate ganciclovir. In vivo, we demonstrated variably persistent elevated PCV values in treated rats and mice with eventual return to baseline values over time. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results provide justification for a lentiviral gene therapy approach to the treatment of nonregenerative anemia associated with chronic renal disease in cats.",

This jaw-associated entity has been only rarely described in animals and purportedly does not exist in humans. This report is the first description of an APA in a primate. A 17-year-old, male, captive cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) had a slowly growing mass on the left rostral maxillary region that involved the bone. The mass was first seen in 2022 associated with the left maxillary canine tooth (203) and regrew after incomplete excision and extraction of the affected canine tooth. Additional excision was performed in 2024, at which time the mass was 3.8 cm in diameter, roughly spherical, tan and hard. Histologically, the mass was composed of packets, cords, anastomosing trabeculae and plexiform ribbons of odontogenic epithelial cells embedded in abundant fibrovascular stroma. Packets of epithelial cells surrounded an abundant, apical, congophilic amyloid matrix that was variably mineralized. Odontogenic epithelium was immunoreactive to cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and had no immunoreactivity for vimentin. These findings are diagnostic for APA. This is the first report of APA in any primate, human or non-human, raising the question of whether this entity can occur in humans.",

    "abstract": "The political environment in post-independence Zimbabwe has been very hostile for interest groups, particularly since 2000 when civil society actions and opposition political activity formidably challenged the power and dominance of the ZANU PF party. However, the 2017 ouster of Robert Mugabe gave rise to renewed hope for political change. Using the political settlements theoretical framework, and data obtained from interviews with Zimbabwean civil society leaders, studies of legal documents, and government pronouncements, we analyze the changes in the relationship between the state and civil society groups during President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s regime. We find that, while civil society faced restrictions during Mugabe's tenure, their existence is now under much more scrutiny under Mnangagwa’s militarized government. This is because authoritarian regimes are more likely to increase the suppression of citizen voices when faced with growing citizen engagement.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that bats are important hosts of filoviruses, yet the specific species involved remain largely unidentified. Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is an essential entry receptor, with amino acid variations influencing viral susceptibility and species-specific tropism. Herein, we conducted combinatorial binding studies with seven filovirus glycoproteins (GPs) and NPC1 orthologs from 81 bat species. We found that GP-NPC1 binding correlated poorly with phylogeny. By integrating binding assays with machine learning, we identified genetic factors influencing virus-receptor-binding and predicted GP-NPC1-binding avidity for additional filoviruses and bats. Moreover, combining receptor-binding avidities with bat geographic distribution and the locations of previous Ebola outbreaks allowed us to rank bats by their potential as Ebola virus hosts. This study represents a comprehensive investigation of filovirus-receptor binding in bats (1,484 GP-NPC1 pairs, 11 filoviruses, and 135 bats) and describes a multidisciplinary approach to predict susceptible species and guide filovirus host surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus genomes have evolutionary histories shaped extensively by recombination. Yet, how often recombination occurs at a cellular level, or the factors that regulate recombination rates, are poorly understood. Utilizing experimental co-infections with pairs of genetically distinct coronaviruses, we found that recombination is both frequent and rare during coinfection. Recombination occurred in every instance of co-infection yet resulted in relatively few recombinant RNAs. By integrating a discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, we found that rates of recombination are determined primarily by rates of cellular co-infection, rather than other possible barriers such as RNA compartmentalization. By staggering the order and timing of infection with each virus we also found that rates of co-infection are themselves heavily influenced by genetic and ecological mechanisms, including superinfection exclusion and the relative fitness of competing viruses. Our study highlights recombination as a potent yet regulated force: frequent enough to ensure a steady influx of genetic variation but also infrequent enough to maintain genomic integrity. As recombination is thought to be an important driver of host-switching and disease emergence, our study provides new insights into the factors that regulate coronavirus recombination and evolution more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek novel ways to understand pathogen infection in native, wildlife hosts. With its deep history of tools and perspectives for understanding the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can shed new light on viral infection dynamics. However, datasets allowing deep explorations of viral communities from an ecological perspective are lacking. We sampled 1086 bats from two, adjacent Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection by herpesviruses, resulting in 3131 short, viral sequences. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm (affinity propagation), we categorized herpesviruses into 43 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to be used in place of species in subsequent ecological analyses. Herpesvirus metacommunities demonstrated long-tailed rank frequency distributions at all analyzed levels of host organization (i.e., individual, population, and community). Although 13 herpesvirus OTUs were detected in more than one host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a single core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all satellite species combined. We describe the natural history of herpesvirus metacommunities in Puerto Rican bats and suggest that viruses follow the general law that communities comprise few common and many rare species. To guide future efforts in the field of viral ecology, hypotheses are presented regarding mechanisms that contribute to these patterns.",

In 2009, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infant, and Children (WIC), a US safety net program for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women and young children, was revised to improve dietary quality, promoting intake of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Prior studies found the revision improved dietary quality, but its impact on downstream health is less understood. We analyzed 2008-2012 national birth certificate data (N = 11,855,417) and employed a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis to examine pre-post trends in outcomes among women predicted to be to be eligible for WIC (treatment group) while \"differencing\" out pre-post trends among predicted WIC-ineligible women (control group). Outcomes include infant birth weight and size for gestational age, and maternal gestational-diabetes-mellitus (GDM) and gestational-weight gain (GWG). The 2009 WIC revision was associated with small reductions in birth weight (-3.52 g; 95 %CI, -4.75 to -2.30) and small-for-gestational-age (-0.08 % points; 95 %CI, -0.15, -0.01), and GWG (-0.05 pounds; 95 %CI, -0.09, -0.02). While the results were robust to most sensitivity tests, they were not for some and therefore should be interpreted cautiously. Disparities emerged in the impact on GDM and GWG across subgroups. The limited evidence of positive effects on infant and maternal health underscores the need for ongoing research to better understand the impact of the 2019 WIC revision, including implementation factors and program design, on downstream health.",

    "abstract": "We provide evidence of a benefit redemption cycle in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Using novel administrative data on item-level redemptions, we show that unlike SNAP, WIC redemptions peak at both the beginning and end of the month. Beginning-of-the-month excess redemptions are concentrated among more popular items such as infant formula, while end-of-the-month excess redemptions are concentrated among less popular items such as infant meats. We document that a substantial share of beneficiaries go at least one month without redeeming anything and discuss how administrative burdens may drive the WIC cycle.",

Using an anchored household-level version of the Supplemental Poverty Measure’s thresholds and resources, we show that poverty is countercyclical, rising in recessions and falling in expansions. We also find that the social safety net provides protection against cyclicality: Post–tax-and-transfer poverty is less cyclical than is pre–tax-and-transfer poverty. The largest cyclicality occurs among children and Black and Hispanic persons, and lower cyclicality is evident among white and elderly persons. The safety net leads to the largest reductions in cyclicality for the elderly and the smallest effects for nonelderly households without children. Finally, we find an inverted U shape with cyclicality low and rising below 75 percent of poverty and declining above.",

Previous research shows that WIC improves birth outcomes, but evidence about impacts on older children and their families is limited. We use a regression discontinuity leveraging a loss of benefits at age five when children become ineligible for WIC and examine nutritional and laboratory outcomes for adults and children. We find little impact on children who aged out of the program. But caloric intake falls and food insecurity increases among adult women, suggesting that mothers protect children by consuming less themselves. We find no effect on others in the household.",

    "abstract": "The economic and public health crisis caused by COVID-19 was devastating and disproportionately hurt Blacks and Hispanics and some other groups. Unemployment rates and other measures of material hardship were higher and increased more during the crisis among Blacks and Hispanics than among non-Hispanic Whites. Congress authorized a historic policy response, incorporating both targeted and universal supports, and expanding both the level and duration of benefits. This response yielded the remarkable result of an estimated decline in the Supplemental Poverty Measure between 2019 and 2020. We study administrative data to investigate the impact of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the crisis. We find that participation in SNAP increased more in counties that experienced a larger employment shock. By contrast, the increase in total SNAP benefits was inversely related to the employment shock. The SNAP benefit increases were less generous to Black and Hispanic SNAP participants than to White.",

    "abstract": "Orf virus causes a self-limited infection in humans that resolves without scarring within 6-12 weeks. However, lesions in the immunocompromised can be progressive and disfiguring. The lesions frequently recur after treatment. To our knowledge, there are eleven published cases of these infections. We propose the name orf progressiva to call attention to this progressive, treatment-resistant entity. We present a 43-year-old male ranch owner with a history of renal transplantation who contracted an orf infection from his lamb. The infection recurred despite attempts at debridement, but achieved near complete resolution after treatment with imiquimod and valacyclovir. The histologic findings of orf progressiva are identical to the early stages of classic orf infection and are characterized by epithelial hyperplasia, intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions, and an edematous, vascular dermis. There is no standard treatment for orf progressiva. Surgical excision has frequently resulted in rapid reoccurrence. Topical therapies such as imiquimod and cidofovir cream in combination with excision have been successful in some cases. Acyclovir or valacyclovir with imiquimod has been reported to be effective. Two patients achieved cure with imiquimod alone. We summarize these cases to prompt recognition of orf progressiva as a distinct clinical entity that requires treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Death in patients with chikungunya is rare and has been associated with encephalitis, hemorrhage, and septic shock. We describe clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings in individuals who died following chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. METHODS: We identified individuals who died in Puerto Rico during 2014 following an acute illness and had CHIKV RNA detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a pre- or postmortem blood or tissue specimen. We performed histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CHIKV antigen on tissue specimens and collected medical data via record review and family interviews. RESULTS: Thirty CHIKV-infected fatal cases were identified (0.8/100 000 population). The median age was 61 years (range: 6 days-86 years), and 19 (63%) were male. Death occurred a median of 4 days (range: 1-29) after illness onset. Nearly all (93%) had at least 1 comorbidity, most frequently hypertension, diabetes, or obesity. Nine had severe comorbidities (eg, chronic heart or kidney disease, sickle cell anemia) or coinfection (eg, leptospirosis). Among 24 fatal cases with tissue specimens, 11 (46%) were positive by IHC. CHIKV antigen was most frequently detected in mesenchymal tissues and mononuclear cells including tissue macrophages, blood mononuclear cells, splenic follicular dendritic cells, and Kupffer cells. Common histopathologic findings were intra-alveolar hemorrhage and edema in the lung, chronic or acute tenosynovitis, and increased immunoblasts in the spleen. CHIKV infection likely caused fatal septic shock in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of tissue specimens provided insights into the pathogenesis of CHIKV, which may rarely result in septic shock and other severe manifestations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dengue is a leading cause of morbidity throughout the tropics; however, accurate population-based estimates of mortality rates are not available. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We established the Enhanced Fatal Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance System (EFASS) to estimate dengue mortality rates in Puerto Rico. Healthcare professionals submitted serum and tissue specimens from patients who died from a dengue-like acute febrile illness, and death certificates were reviewed to identify additional cases. Specimens were tested for markers of dengue virus (DENV) infection by molecular, immunologic, and immunohistochemical methods, and were also tested for West Nile virus, Leptospira spp., and other pathogens based on histopathologic findings. Medical records were reviewed and clinical data abstracted. A total of 311 deaths were identified, of which 58 (19%) were DENV laboratory-positive. Dengue mortality rates were 1.05 per 100,000 population in 2010, 0.16 in 2011 and 0.36 in 2012. Dengue mortality was highest among adults 19-64 years and seniors ≥65 years (1.17 and 1.66 deaths per 100,000, respectively). Other pathogens identified included 34 Leptospira spp. cases and one case of Burkholderia pseudomallei and Neisseria meningitidis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: EFASS showed that dengue mortality rates among adults were higher than reported for influenza, and identified a leptospirosis outbreak and index cases of melioidosis and meningitis.",

Here, we describe four fatal cases of Leptospira species/dengue virus co-infection in Puerto Rico. Although all patients sought care early, antibiotic administration was delayed for most. Steroids were administered to all patients, in most cases before antibiotics. These cases show the need for clinicians evaluating patients in or recently returned from the tropics with acute febrile illness to consider both dengue and leptospirosis. Furthermore, they illustrate the need for nucleic acid- or antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests to enable timely patient diagnosis and management. In particular, antibiotic therapy should be initiated early for patients with suspected leptospirosis, and steroids should not be administered to patients with suspected dengue.",

Trans people face markedly high levels of workplace discrimination, unemployment, and poverty, and therefore offer unique insight into this question. Prior research theorizes how trans workers get repositioned in a binary, patriarchal gender order, but we lack a conceptual model to explain the labor market experience of people who are systematically sanctioned as gender deviants. By analyzing work history interviews from 23 trans women of color based across the United States, this article argues that crossing gender boundaries is a racialized experience that can come with an economic cost. After transitioning, trans women of color face three forms of economic sanctioning: exclusion, a racially gendered glass ceiling, and constrained employment options within a segmented labor market. Thus, work organizations premised on a hierarchical classification scheme have the option, not only to reposition people on the basis of a classification change, but to deem them unassimilable.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Animals display a body temperature rhythm (BTR). Little is known about the mechanisms by which a rhythmic pattern of BTR is regulated and how body temperature is set at different times of the day. As small ectotherms, Drosophila exhibit a daily temperature preference rhythm (TPR), which generates BTR. Here, we demonstrate dorsal clock networks that play essential roles in TPR. Dorsal neurons 2 (DN2s) are the main clock for TPR. We find that DN2s and posterior DN1s (DN1ps) contact and the extent of contacts increases during the day and that the silencing of DN2s or DN1ps leads to a lower temperature preference. The data suggest that temporal control of the microcircuit from DN2s to DN1ps contributes to TPR regulation. We also identify anterior DN1s (DN1as) as another important clock for TPR. Thus, we show that the DN networks predominantly control TPR and determine both a rhythmic pattern and preferred temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Speakers consider their listeners and adjust the way they communicate. One well-studied example is the register of infant-directed speech (IDS), which differs acoustically from speech directed to adults. However, little work has explored how parents adjust speech to infants across different contexts. This is important because infants and parents engage in many activities throughout each day. The current study tests whether the properties of IDS in English vary across three in-lab tasks (sorting objects, free play, and storytelling). We analysed acoustic features associated with prosody, including mean fundamental frequency (F0, perceived as pitch), F0 range, and word rate. We found that both parents' pitch ranges and word rates varied depending on the task in IDS. The storytelling task stood out among the tasks for having a wider pitch range and faster word rate. The results depict how context can drive parents' speech adjustments to infants.",

    "abstract": "This study compares how English-speaking adults and children from the United States adapt their speech when talking to a real person and a smart speaker (Amazon Alexa) in a psycholinguistic experiment. Overall, participants produced more effortful speech when talking to a device (longer duration and higher pitch). These differences also varied by age: children produced even higher pitch in device-directed speech, suggesting a stronger expectation to be misunderstood by the system. In support of this, we see that after a staged recognition error by the device, children increased pitch even more. Furthermore, both adults and children displayed the same degree of variation in their responses for whether \"Alexa seems like a real person or not\", further indicating that children's conceptualization of the system's competence shaped their register adjustments, rather than an increased anthropomorphism response. This work speaks to models on the mechanisms underlying speech production, and human-computer interaction frameworks, providing support for routinized theories of spoken interaction with technology.",

    "abstract": "The present experiments were designed to assess infants' abilities to use syllable co-occurrence regularities to segment fluent speech across contexts. Specifically, we investigated whether 9-month-old infants could use statistical regularities in one speech context to support speech segmentation in a second context. Contexts were defined by different word sets representing contextual differences that might occur across conversations or utterances. This mimics the integration of information across multiple interactions within a single language, which is critical for language acquisition. In particular, we performed two experiments to assess whether a statistically segmented word could be used to anchor segmentation in a second, more challenging context, namely speech with variable word lengths. The results of Experiment 1 were consistent with past work suggesting that statistical learning may be hindered by speech with word-length variability, which is inherent to infants' natural speech environments. In Experiment 2, we found that infants could use a previously statistically segmented word to support word segmentation in a novel, challenging context. We also present findings suggesting that this ability was associated with infants' early word knowledge but not their performance on a cognitive development assessment.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the neural substrates underlying early memory functioning. To gain more insight, we examined how toddlers remember newly learned words. Hippocampal and anterior medial-temporal lobe (MTL) processes have been hypothesized to support forming and retaining the association between novel words and their referents, but direct evidence of this connection in early childhood is lacking. We assessed 2-year-olds (n = 38) for their memory of newly learned pseudowords associated with novel objects and puppets. We tested memory for these associations during the same session as learning and after a 1-week delay. We then played these pseudowords, previously known words, and completely novel pseudowords during natural nocturnal sleep, while collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Activation in the left hippocampus and the left anterior MTL for newly learned compared to novel words was associated with same-session memory for these newly learned words only when they were learned as puppet names. Activation for known words was associated with memory for puppet names at the 1-week delay. Activation for newly learned words was also associated with overall productive vocabulary. These results underscore an early developing link between memory mechanisms and word learning in the medial temporal lobe.",

Previous work demonstrated that bilingual infants show greater openness to non-native language sounds in object labels than monolinguals (Hay et al., 2015; Singh, 2018). It remains unclear whether bilingual openness extends to nonspeech sounds. We presented 14- and 19-month-old bilinguals with object labels consisting of nonspeech tones. Monolinguals recently displayed learning of the same labels at 14 months, but not 19 months (Graf Estes et al., 2018). In contrast, bilinguals failed to learn the labels. We propose that hearing phonological variation across two languages helps bilinguals reject nonspeech word forms.",

    "abstract": "On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic. Hospitals throughout the USA and the residency programs housed therein have drastically altered their standard operations to slow the spread of disease. Maintaining the educational mission of a residency program within the parameters of social distancing mandates is an unprecedented challenge to graduate medical education and will remain so for the near future. We evaluated resident perception of our efforts to transition educational activities within the residency to an online, remote format utilizing Microsoft SharePoint. Educational conferences were transitioned to a videoconferencing platform on March 13, 2020 in conjunction with the deployment of an intradepartmental Microsoft SharePoint site to provide educational resources, disseminate scheduling changes, and provide wellness resources in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. An 11-question survey available from 4 Jan 2020-4 Jun 2020 surveyed resident perceptions of the instituted changes. Twenty-six of 31 residents (83.8%) responded to the resident survey invitation. Twenty-four of 26 residents (92.3%) characterized the SharePoint as useful. Twenty of 26 residents (76.9%) desired attending guidance as to how to utilize the online resources for each resident rotation. A total of 92.3% (24/26) of residents felt that the program's response utilizing SharePoint engendered a greater sense of belonging to their work community. Resident perception of the transition to online learning utilizing Microsoft SharePoint as a distribution platform was generally positive, helping to mitigate untoward educational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to determine dose-area product-to-effective dose (DAP/E) conversion coefficients for a five-view pelvic radiograph series. DAP/E conversion coefficients may be used for radiation dose optimization when designing institutional protocols for pelvic trauma evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We conducted a retrospective record review of 25 patients at a level 1 trauma center who had sustained pelvic fractures and required a five-view pelvic radiograph series during workup. E values given in International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 103 were simulated with a PC-based Monte Carlo program in conjunction with anthropomorphic phantoms adjusted on the basis of patient height and weight. Inputs included tube voltage (in kV), tube filtration (in millimeters of aluminum), anode angle, x-ray beam collimation, geometric distances, and angle of projection for each radiograph in the series. An incident polychromatic x-ray spectrum was generated and matched to the corresponding DAP values of each radiograph, and regression analysis was performed for the DAP/E conversion coefficients. RESULTS.E was strongly correlated with DAP independent from body mass index, with a mean global DAP/E conversion coefficient of 0.0125 mSv/dGy · cm2 for all radiographs (R2 = 0.95). Mean DAP/E conversion coefficients were 0.0133, 0.0110, 0.0143, 0.0113, and 0.0101 mSv/dGy · cm2 for anteroposterior, inlet, outlet, Judet left, and Judet right views, respectively (all R2 ≥ 0.94). CONCLUSION. DAP/E conversion coefficients are provided for a five-view pelvic radiograph series to allow reliable estimation of E. Measurement of cumulative E may affirm protocol design changes for the management of pelvic trauma.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Clinical decisions are often made on weight-bearing radiographs. However, it is unknown whether various weight-bearing conditions alter specific radiographic measurements. The purpose of this study was to determine whether percentage weight-bearing influences radiographic measurements of the normal foot. Methods: A prospective study with 20 healthy individuals had radiographs of the foot under 5 weight-bearing conditions (non-weight-bearing, 10% body weight, 25% body weight, 50% body weight, and 100% body weight). Measurements were made of hallux valgus angle (HVA), 1-2 intermetatarsal angle (IMA), talonavicular coverage angle (TNCA), talocalcaneal angle (TCA), forefoot width, LisFranc distance, cuboid height to ground (CHG), and talo-first metatarsal angle (TMA) of each weight-bearing condition. Statistical differences of each measurement for each weight-bearing condition were determined. Results: The TNCA and TCA increased significantly, whereas the CHG decreased significantly with increased percentage body weight. There were no differences in HVA, IMA, forefoot width, LisFranc distance, and TMA with increased percentage body weight. Conclusions: This study shows an increase in TNCA and TCA, and decrease in CHG, demonstrating a flattening of the medial arch, increasing hindfoot valgus, and midfoot external rotation and abduction with increasing percentage body weight applied to a foot. Percentage weight-bearing does not change radiographs in the foot between 25% and 100% weight-bearing. The clinical relevance of this finding is that graduated postinjury or postoperative weight-bearing regimens may only be relevant if the patient is either less than or greater than 25% of body weight on their extremity.

    "abstract": "Objectives-The aim of this study was to determine the intra- and inter-rater reliability of sonographic measurements of the median nerve cross-sectional area in individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome and healthy control participants.Methods-The median nerve cross-sectional area was evaluated by sonography in 18 participants with carpal tunnel syndrome (18 upper extremities) and 9 control participants (18 upper extremities) at 2 visits 1 week apart. Two examiners, both blinded to the presence or absence of carpal tunnel syndrome, captured independent sonograms of the median nerve at the levels of the carpal tunnel inlet, pronator quadratus, and mid-forearm. The cross-sectional area was later measured by each examiner independently. Each also traced images that were captured by the other examiner.Results-Both the intra- and inter-rater reliability rates were highest for images taken at the carpal tunnel inlet (radiologist, r = 0.86; sonographer, r = 0.87; inter-rater, r = 0.95; all P < .0001), whereas they was lowest for the pronator quadratus (r = 0.49, 0.29, and 0.72, respectively; all P < .0001). At the mid-forearm, the intra-rater reliability was lower for both the radiologist and sonographer, whereas the inter-rater reliability was relatively high (r = 0.54, 0.55, and 0.81; all P < .0001). Tracing of captured images by different examiners showed high concordance for the median cross-sectional area at the carpal tunnel inlet (r = 0.96-0.98; P < .0001).Conclusions-The highest intra- and inter-rater reliability was found at the carpal tunnel inlet. The results also demonstrate that tracing of the median nerve cross-sectional area from captured images by different examiners does not contribute significantly to measurement variability.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (1) develop an augmented reality (AR) navigation platform for craniomaxillofacial (CMF) and head and neck surgery; (2) apply it to a range of surgical cases; and (3) evaluate the advantages, disadvantages, and clinical opportunities for AR navigation. STUDY DESIGN: A multi-center retrospective case series. SETTING: Four tertiary care academic centers. METHODS: A novel AR navigation platform was collaboratively developed with Xironetic and deployed intraoperatively using only a head-mounted display (Microsoft HoloLens 2). Virtual surgical plans were generated from computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging data and uploaded onto the AR platform. A reference array was mounted to the patient, and the virtual plan was registered to the patient intraoperatively. A retrospective review of all AR-navigated CMF cases since September 2023 was performed. RESULTS: Thirty-three cases were reviewed and classified as either trauma, orthognathic, tumor, or craniofacial. The AR platform had several advantages over traditional navigation including real-time 3D visualization of the surgical plan, identification of critical structures, and real-time tracking. Furthermore, this case series presents the first-known examples of (1) AR instrument tracking for midface osteotomies, (2) AR tracking of the zygomaticomaxillary complex during fracture reduction, (3) mandibular tracking in orthognathic surgery, (4) AR fibula cutting guides for mandibular reconstruction, and (5) integration of real-time infrared visualization in an AR headset for vasculature identification. CONCLUSION: While still a developing technology, AR navigation provides several advantages over traditional navigation for CMF and head and neck surgery, including heads up, interactive 3D visualization of the surgical plan, identification of critical anatomy, and real-time tracking.",

    "abstract": "Children with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) often receive unnecessary imaging studies, hospital admissions, and interhospital transfers leading to avoidable burdens to patients, caregivers, and health systems. The Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) consider a non-displaced skull fracture as a BIG-2 injury warranting hospitalization. In our clinical experience, patients with simple isolated non-displaced linear skull fractures seldom develop TBI-related complications. In this study, we evaluated the need for hospital admission for simple isolated linear skull fractures by examining the occurrence of clinically important TBI (ci-TBI) and patient outcome. We performed a retrospective study evaluating pediatric TBI admissions from 2018 to 2023 using an institutional registry of TBI patients requiring neurosurgery consultation. Patients included in our study cohort were 17 years and younger at injury, had a head computed tomography with an isolated skull fracture and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 14 to 15. We excluded patients who had an intracranial injury (ICI), fractures extending into the skull base, or crossing the sagittal sinus. We reviewed medical records to identify the presence of ci-TBI: ICI resulting in death, neurosurgical intervention, intubation for more than 24 h, or hospital admission for at least 2 nights due to TBI. Repeat imaging studies obtained were reviewed to assess the progression of injury and association with clinical deterioration. Patient outcome was evaluated with the Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOS-E) 6 months after injury. Univariable statistics were calculated for continuous variables and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method for proportions that were very close to 0 or 1 and the Wilson score interval for small-to-moderate proportions. A total of 804 subjects were analyzed, and 402 (50.0%) patients had a BIG-2 injury. A total of 247 of these BIG-2 patients (61.4%) had a simple, non-displaced fracture, and no associated ICI; 198 of these patients (80.2%) were transferred from referring hospitals. In both primary admissions and transfers, no significant injury progression on imaging was noted, no neurosurgical intervention occurred, and no patient had ci-TBI (0/247; 95% CI: 0% to 1.5%). Six-month GOS-E was available in a subset (53.8%) of patients: 98.5% were discharged home and had a favorable outcome (defined as GOS-E 5 to 7). ci-TBI rarely develops in children with simple isolated non-displaced skull fractures indicating that hospital admission and inpatient observation may not be necessary. In the context of the BIG, these patients can be considered for re-classification to a BIG-1 injury, which can reduce interhospital transfer and admission rates following implementation, while maintaining patient safety. A revised BIG classification for pediatric injuries is proposed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain-computer interfaces can enable communication for people with paralysis by transforming cortical activity associated with attempted speech into text on a computer screen. Communication with brain-computer interfaces has been restricted by extensive training requirements and limited accuracy. METHODS: A 45-year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with tetraparesis and severe dysarthria underwent surgical implantation of four microelectrode arrays into his left ventral precentral gyrus 5 years after the onset of the illness; these arrays recorded neural activity from 256 intracortical electrodes. We report the results of decoding his cortical neural activity as he attempted to speak in both prompted and unstructured conversational contexts. Decoded words were displayed on a screen and then vocalized with the use of text-to-speech software designed to sound like his pre-ALS voice. RESULTS: On the first day of use (25 days after surgery), the neuroprosthesis achieved 99.6% accuracy with a 50-word vocabulary. Calibration of the neuroprosthesis required 30 minutes of cortical recordings while the participant attempted to speak, followed by subsequent processing. On the second day, after 1.4 additional hours of system training, the neuroprosthesis achieved 90.2% accuracy using a 125,000-word vocabulary. With further training data, the neuroprosthesis sustained 97.5% accuracy over a period of 8.4 months after surgical implantation, and the participant used it to communicate in self-paced conversations at a rate of approximately 32 words per minute for more than 248 cumulative hours. CONCLUSIONS: In a person with ALS and severe dysarthria, an intracortical speech neuroprosthesis reached a level of performance suitable to restore conversational communication after brief training.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact of surgical intervention on anxiety levels in patients with various types of pituitary adenoma (PA). METHOD: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines until October 2022, searching Embase, PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus. RESULTS: A total of 32 studies were included, encompassing 2,681 patients with the mean age of 53.33 ± 6.48 years (43.4% male). Among all subtypes, 664 diagnosed with Cushing's disease (25.8%), 612 with acromegaly (23.8%), 282 with prolactinoma (10.9%), and 969 with nonfunctional pituitary adenomas (37.6%). Pituitary insufficiency was the most common complication. Considering therapeutic modalities, 515 patients (29.8%) underwent endoscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery, while 222 (12.9%) underwent microscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery. The type of trans-sphenoidal surgery was not specified in 977 (56.6%) patients. A total of 17 studies including 1510 patients which mostly assessed anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were included in the meta-analysis. Preoperative evaluation using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire showed a pooled score of 8.27 (95%CI 4.54-12.01), while postoperative evaluation yielded a pooled score of 6.49 (95%CI 5.35-7.63), indicating no significant difference. Preoperative SAS assessment resulted in a pooled score of 50.43 (95%CI 37.40-63.45), with postoperative pooled score of 55.91 (95%CI 49.40-62.41), showing no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed no significant difference in anxiety scores pre- and postoperatively. While our findings suggest stability in anxiety levels following surgical intervention, it is imperative to recognize the limitations of the current evidence base. The observed lack of consensus may be influenced by factors such as the heterogeneous nature of the patient population, variations in the characteristics of pituitary adenomas, diverse therapeutic approaches, and potential confounding variables such as pre-existing mental health conditions and coping mechanisms. Further research is warranted to elucidate the nuanced relationship between surgical intervention for PA and anxiety outcomes, considering these complex interactions and employing rigorous methodologies to address potential sources of bias.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Benign mesothelial cysts are rare, and to our knowledge there are no reported cases of benign mesothelial cysts in patients with a history of gastroschisis. Case presentation: A 15-year-old girl with a history of complicated gastroschisis and multiple operations as a child presented to the emergency department with back pain and abdominal bloating that worsened over the course of a year. At the time of presentation, she was febrile, but her basic blood tests were within normal limits. Imaging studies including an abdominal ultrasound, a computed tomography of the abdomen, and a magnetic resonance imagining of the abdomen demonstrated a 31× 21 × 11cm cystic abdominopelvic lesion, the origin of which was unclear. Tumor markers including alpha fetoprotein, CA 125, CA 19–9, beta HCG, carcinoembryonic antigen, inhibin A/B, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal. The fluid was sampled by needle aspiration. Amber fluid with mostly macrophages (72 %) and was obtained. A pigtail catheter was placed, and 2500 ml of clear yellow/brown fluid were drained. She was sent home with the drain and was scheduled for an elective cyst excision but presented to the hospital with a bowel obstruction a few days later. She underwent an extensive laparoscopic lysis of adhesions, drain removal, and partial excision of the cyst wall. The pathology analysis was consistent with a benign mesothelial cyst. No new drains were placed. She recovered well from the operation. At 3 months of follow up she is doing well and has no recurrence of the cyst by ultrasound. She will continue to be monitored with periodic ultrasounds. Conclusion: While rare, benign mesothelial cysts should be on the differential diagnosis of patients with large abdominal cysts, particularly if they have a history of prior abdominal operations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent placement in infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow is being increasingly used in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To correlate computed tomographic (CT) angiography morphology and length of the PDA with catheter angiography and its relation to eventual PDA stent length. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified all pediatric patients who underwent PDA stenting at our institute from 2004 to 2018. We included children who had CT angiography prior to stenting. PDA length was measured by a radiologist blinded to the catheter angiography data, using Syngo-via post-processing software (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Vessel centerline technique was used. We measured the actual length of the duct as well as straight length between aortic and pulmonary ends. PDA morphology tortuosity index was classified as straight (Type I), mildly tortuous with 1 turn (Type II) and tortuous with >1 turn (Type III), and the PDA origin was noted. The PDA was also measured and morphology classified on catheter angiography by an interventional cardiologist blinded to the CT angiography findings. We compared the CT angiography and catheter angiography lengths, straight lengths and stent length using scatter plots and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: A total of 83 children who had PDA stenting were identified, of whom 17 had prior CT angiography. Fifteen of these were neonates. There was agreement between CT angiography and catheter angiography regarding the PDA morphology tortuosity index in 94% of cases and PDA origin in 100% of cases. There was moderate agreement between CT angiography and catheter angiography actual and straight PDA lengths, with ICC coefficients of 0.65 and 0.68, respectively. There was moderate agreement between CT angiography actual length, CT angiography straight length, catheter angiography actual length and eventual stented PDA length, with ICCs of 0.57, 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. There was poor agreement between catheter angiography straight length and eventual stented PDA length, with an ICC of 0.39. CONCLUSION: PDA length and morphology description on CT angiography correlates well with catheter angiography and can be a reliable guide for the interventional cardiologist in decision-making regarding appropriate choice of PDA stent length.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Focal liver lesions are common in children and adults after Fontan procedures. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between liver shear stiffness, using magnetic resonance (MR) elastography, and the presence of focal liver lesions in patients after Fontan procedures (total cavopulmonary anastomosis). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. By searching institutional electronic medical records, we identified all patients with a history of Fontan palliation of congenital heart disease who had undergone same-day liver MR elastography and liver MRI without and with intravenous contrast material between January 2012 and December 2017. Using imaging reports, patients were placed into two groups: 1) no focal liver lesions and 2) one or more focal liver lesions. Patient age, sex, mean liver shear stiffness (kPa) and maximum single anatomical level liver shear stiffness (kPa) were recorded. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare age and liver stiffness between groups, while the Fisher exact test was used to assess the impact of gender on liver lesions. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients met study inclusion criteria; 33 (69%) had one or more focal liver lesions. The median age was 20.0 years (IQR [interquartile range]: 10.8-29.1 years) for patients without liver lesions and 19.9 years (IQR: 17.2-27.0 years) for patients with liver lesions (P=0.49). Eleven of 21 male patients (52.4%) had liver lesions compared to 22 of 27 female patients (81.5%) (P=0.058). Mean (4.62 kPa [IQR: 4.10-5.59 kPa] vs. 4.10 kPa [IQR: 3.44-4.80 kPa]; P=0.02) and maximum (5.53 kPa [IQR: 4.64-6.56 kPa] vs. 4.50 kPa [IQR: 3.82-5.35 kPa]; P=0.009) liver stiffness were significantly higher in patients without liver lesions as compared to patients with liver lesions. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a significant negative association between focal liver lesions and increased liver stiffness in patients following Fontan procedures.",

    "abstract": "Chronic injury to the liver leads to inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis, which when untreated can lead to myofibroblast activation and fibrogenesis with deposition of fibrous tissue. Over time, liver fibrosis can accumulate and lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease with associated portal hypertension and liver failure. Detection and accurate measurement of the severity of liver fibrosis are important for assessing disease severity and progression, directing patient management, and establishing prognosis. Liver biopsy, generally considered the clinical standard of reference for detecting and measuring liver fibrosis, is invasive and has limitations, including sampling error, relatively high cost, and possible complications. For these reasons, liver biopsy is suboptimal for fibrosis screening, longitudinal monitoring, and assessing therapeutic efficacy. A variety of established and emerging qualitative and quantitative noninvasive MRI methods for detecting and staging liver fibrosis might ultimately serve these purposes. In this article, we review multiple MRI methods for detecting and measuring liver fibrosis and discuss the diagnostic performance and specific strengths and limitations of the various techniques.",

As an example, a case study is presented comparing the performance of a candidate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) chemistry to the current RT-PCR chemistry in use when the assay was originally validated. The present study revealed that, for all of the validation factors evaluated, the candidate method performed at least as well and generally better than the current method. The candidate method was, therefore, deemed fit for the original intended purpose of the current method and rendered acceptable for use.

The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between destemming force and fruit width, fruit length, and pericarp thickness, along with the genetic potential for combining the easy‐destemming attribute with the preferred fruit morphology of New Mexico (NM) pod‐type green chile. This investigation will define optimal selection criteria for reducing destemming force, while preserving the distinctive morphology of NM pod‐type green chile. We quantified phenotypic and genetic variation of 285 F<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> families from three populations developed from reciprocal crosses between three NM pod‐type cultivars and an easy‐destemming cultivar. The results show destemming force exhibited significant positive phenotypic correlations with pericarp thickness and fruit width (0.90 and 0.92, respectively) and fruit length (0.69). Genetic correlations for each of the three populations for fruit morphological traits ranged from 0.2 to 0.9, with pericarp thickness with the highest genetic correlation with destemming force. Narrow‐sense heritability values were between 0.2 and 0.8, with destemming force and fruit length consistently having higher narrow‐sense heritability values. These findings suggest a correlation between the expression of pericarp thickness and destemming force. The lower estimates for pericarp thickness indicate environmental influences may play a more significant role in determining trait expression. The information generated from this study will aid in the development of efficient cultivars suited for mechanical harvesting in NM pod‐type breeding programs.</jats:p>",

    "issued": "2024-04",
    "abstract": "With vegetable consumption in the US significantly lower than that recommended by nutritionists, and growers facing increasing production challenges, a survey of carrot stakeholders was conducted to develop a plan for addressing these challenges as they pertain to carrot. The survey revealed that the carrot industry needs breeding stocks and genomic tools to develop carrots with improved field performance, including disease and pest resistance and abiotic stress tolerance, to meet growing market demands; and improved flavor and nutritional quality to better meet consumer needs. To address these needs, the carrot Specialty Crops Research Initiative (SCRI) Project was proposed and funded by the USDA-NIFA. We have screened the national germplasm collection of around 700 diverse cultivated carrot accessions and identified new sources of traits for improving carrot productivity and quality, expanding product development, and strengthening economic viability. Improved cultivars with these traits will provide a cost-effective, environmentally favorable means to deliver an improved carrot crop to growers, processors, and consumers. However, carrot breeders need tools to track genes for improving the crop, and will need tested breeding stocks to develop superior cultivars more efficiently. The goals of this project are to: 1) develop cost-effective genomic tools to advance carrot breeding populations with the economically and nutritionally significant traits identified by stakeholders; 2) map genes underlying economically important traits so breeders can effectively deploy these traits in cultivars for growers, processors, and consumers; 3) evaluate bioavailability of nutrients in carrots with varying nutrient composition that may influence nutritional impact; and 4) evaluate the market value and impact of carrot traits on grower and consumer decisions.",

    "issued": "2023",
    "abstract": "Introduction: The majority of peppers in the US for fresh market and processing are handpicked, and harvesting can account for 20-50% of production costs. Innovation in mechanical harvesting would increase availability; lower the costs of local, healthy vegetable products; and perhaps improve food safety and expand markets. Most processed peppers require removal of pedicels (stem and calyx) from the fruit, but lack of an efficient mechanical process for this operation has hindered adoption of mechanical harvest. In this paper, we present characterization and advancements in breeding green chile peppers for mechanical harvesting. Specifically, we describe inheritance and expression of an easy-destemming trait derived from the landrace UCD-14 that facilitates machine harvest of green chiles. Methods: A torque gauge was used for measuring bending forces similar to those of a harvester and applied to two biparental populations segregating for destemming force and rate. Genotyping by sequencing was used to generate genetic maps for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. Results: A major destemming QTL was found on chromosome 10 across populations and environments. Eight additional population and/or environment-specific QTL were also identified. Chromosome 10 QTL markers were used to help introgress the destemming trait into jalapeño-type peppers. Low destemming force lines combined with improvements in transplant production enabled mechanical harvest of destemmed fruit at a rate of 41% versus 2% with a commercial jalapeńo hybrid. Staining for the presence of lignin at the pedicel/fruit boundary indicated the presence of an abscission zone and homologs of genes known to affect organ abscission were found under several QTL, suggesting that the easy-destemming trait may be due to the presence and activation of a pedicel/fruit abscission zone. Conclusion: Presented here are tools to measure the easy-destemming trait, its physiological basis, possible molecular pathways, and expression of the trait in various genetic backgrounds. Mechanical harvest of destemmed mature green chile fruits was achieved by combining easy-destemming with transplant management.",

    "abstract": "GRF-GIF chimeric proteins from multiple source species enhance in vitro regeneration in both wild and cultivated lettuce. In addition, they enhance regeneration in multiple types of lettuce including butterheads, romaines, and crispheads. The ability of plants to regenerate in vitro has been exploited for use in tissue culture systems for plant propagation, plant transformation, and genome editing. The success of in vitro regeneration is often genotype dependent and continues to be a bottleneck for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and its deployment for improvement of some crop species. Manipulation of transcription factors that play key roles in plant development such as BABY BOOM, WUSCHEL, and GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs) has improved regeneration and transformation efficiencies in several plant species. Here, we compare the efficacy of GRF-GIF gene fusions from multiple species to boost regeneration efficiency and shooting frequency in four genotypes of wild and cultivated lettuce (Lactuca spp. L.). In addition, we show that GRF-GIFs with mutated miRNA 396 binding sites increase regeneration efficiency and shooting frequency when compared to controls. We also present a co-transformation strategy for increased transformation efficiency and recovery of transgenic plants harboring a gene of interest. This strategy will enhance the recovery of transgenic plants of other lettuce genotypes and likely other crops in the Compositae family.",

    "abstract": "Pepper (Capsicum annuum) is an important vegetable crop that has been subjected to intensive breeding, resulting in limited genetic diversity, especially for sweet peppers. Previous studies have reported pepper draft genome assemblies using short read sequencing, but their capture of the extent of large structural variants (SVs), such as presence-absence variants (PAVs), inversions, and copy-number variants (CNVs) in the complex pepper genome falls short. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of representative sweet and hot pepper accessions by long-read and/or linked-read methods and advanced scaffolding technologies. First, we developed a high-quality reference genome for the sweet pepper cultivar 'Dempsey' and then used the reference genome to identify SVs in 11 other pepper accessions and constructed a graph-based pan-genome for pepper. We annotated an average of 42 972 gene families in each pepper accession, defining a set of 19 662 core and 23 115 non-core gene families. The new pepper pan-genome includes informative variants, 222 159 PAVs, 12 322 CNVs, and 16 032 inversions. Pan-genome analysis revealed PAVs associated with important agricultural traits, including potyvirus resistance, fruit color, pungency, and pepper fruit orientation. Comparatively, a large number of genes are affected by PAVs, which is positively correlated with the high frequency of transposable elements (TEs), indicating TEs play a key role in shaping the genomic landscape of peppers. The datasets presented herein provide a powerful new genomic resource for genetic analysis and genome-assisted breeding for pepper improvement.",

    "abstract": "Parents of autistic children may have limited time and resources to participate in physical activity, a key aspect of health. Previous studies have been small and included mostly mothers, rather than fathers. No studies have examined physical activity in these parents during another pregnancy, when physical activity is especially important for maternal and fetal health. We aimed to fill this gap by examining physical activity levels among mothers and fathers caring for an autistic child before and during a subsequent pregnancy. We used data from a study which followed pregnant individuals who already had a child with autism. We asked mothers and fathers to report their levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity. We found that mothers and fathers of autistic children reported lower physical activity levels than the national average and were unlikely to meet Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Pregnant mothers were the least likely to participate in physical activity, particularly if their autistic child scored highly on a measure of autistic traits. Given that parental physical activity has benefits for parents and children, family-based interventions may be needed to help support parents' physical activity levels.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures and social determinants likely influence specific childhood asthma phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the Child Opportunity Index (COI) at birth, measuring multiple neighborhood opportunities, influences incidence rates (IRs) for asthma with recurrent exacerbations (ARE). METHODS: We tested for COI associations with ARE IRs in 15,877 children born between 1990 and 2018 in the ECHO (Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes) program. Parent-reported race and ethnicity and other demographics were assessed as effect modifiers. RESULTS: The IRs of ARE for children born in very low COI neighborhoods was higher (IR = 10.98; 95% CI: 9.71, 12.25) than for other COI categories. Rates for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children were significantly higher than non-Hispanic White children in every COI category. The ARE IRs for children born in very low COI neighborhoods were several-fold higher for NHB and Hispanic Black children (IR = 15.30; 95% CI: 13.10, 17.49; and IR = 18.48; 95% CI: 8.80, 28.15, respectively) when compared to White children. Adjusting for individual-level characteristics, children born in very low COI neighborhoods demonstrated an ARE IR ratio of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.59) with a higher incidence of cases among children ages 2 to 4 years and with a parental history of asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of ARE were higher among children born in under-resourced communities, and this relationship is strongest for young minoritized children with a parental history of asthma. Higher rates for NHB even in the highest COI categories suggest that risk associated with race persists regardless of social disadvantage.",

    "abstract": "Executive functioning (EF) has been linked to chronic disease risk in children. Health behaviors are thought to partially explain this association. The current cross-sectional study evaluated specific domains of EF and varied health behaviors in three pediatric life stages. Pediatric participants (early childhood n = 2074, Mage = 6.4 ± 0.9 y; middle childhood n = 3230, Mage = 9.6 ± 1.2 y; adolescence n = 1416, Mage = 15.2 ± 1.7 y) were part of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. They completed neurocognitive tasks measuring cognitive flexibility, behavioral inhibition, and working memory. Parent- and/or child-report measures of dietary intake, physical activity, sleep duration and quality, income, and positive parenting were also collected. Neighborhood crime and greenspace were calculated from publicly available census-tract level indices. After adjusting for study site, child body mass index, and demographics, working memory was related in the hypothesized direction to several dietary behaviors within all pediatric life stages. Working memory and cognitive flexibility were positively related to physical activity in middle childhood and adolescence. In adolescence, behavioral inhibition was positively related to physical activity and inversely related to sugar-sweetened beverage and total caloric intake. Associations with sleep were all non-significant. All significant associations reflected small effect sizes. Income, positive parenting, greenspace, and crime did not significantly influence any of the EF-health behavior associations. Findings highlight the need to consider EF domains, specific health behaviors, and developmental stage in creating intervention strategies that target EF to improve health behaviors. The small effect sizes reinforce the need for multi-tiered interventions to maximize health.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Our goals were to: 1) examine the occurrence of behavioral and emotional symptoms in children on the autism spectrum in a large national sample, stratifying by sex, and 2) evaluate whether children with increased autism-related social communication deficits also experience more behavioral and emotional problems. METHODS:  Participants (n = 7,998) were from 37 cohorts from the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. Cross-sectional information on demographic factors, parent-report of an ASD diagnosis by clinician, Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scores were obtained for children aged 2.5-18 years by surveys. We examined mean differences in CBCL Total Problems and DSM-oriented subscale scores by autism diagnosis and by child sex. Analyses using logistic regression were conducted to examine whether autism was associated with higher CBCL scores. We further examined if these relationships differed by child age category (< 6 years, 6-11 years, 12 + years). The relationships between SRS score and CBCL total and subscale scores were examined using quantile regression models, with analyses adjusted for child sex and age. RESULTS:  In ECHO, 553 youth were reported by a parent to have a clinician diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (432 [78%] boys and 121 [22%] girls). Youth on the spectrum had higher mean CBCL raw scores on Total Problems and all DSM-oriented subscales compared to those not on the spectrum (all p < 0.0001). Analyses adjusted for sex and stratified by age group indicated that higher odds of autism diagnosis were associated with total, depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) scales in the top 30% of the CBCL score distribution. Autistic girls were more likely to have parent-reported depression and anxiety compared to autistic boys. In quantile regression analyses, we observed evidence of stronger associations between SRS and CBCL for those in higher quantiles of CBCL total problems scale score (beta representing 1-unit change in SRS associated with 1-unit increase in CBCL total problems scale score), among children in the 70-90th percentile (β = 1.60, p < 0.01), or top 10th percentile (β = 2.43, p < 0.01) of the CBCL total problems scale score distribution. Similar findings were seen for the DSM-oriented depression, anxiety, and ADHD subscales. CONCLUSION:  Results from this large national sample suggest increased behavioral and emotional problems among autistic children compared to non-autistic children throughout early life. Among children on the spectrum this may warrant increased monitoring for co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems.",

    "abstract": "Autism is four times more prevalent in males than females. To study whether this reflects a difference in genetic predisposition attributed to autosomal rare variants, we evaluated sex differences in effect size of damaging protein-truncating and missense variants on autism predisposition in 47,061 autistic individuals using a liability model with differing thresholds. Given the sex differences in the rates of cognitive impairment among autistic individuals, we also compared effect sizes of rare variants between individuals with and without cognitive impairment or motor delay. Although these variants mediated different likelihoods of autism with versus without cognitive or motor difficulties, their effect sizes on the liability scale did not differ significantly by sex exome wide or in genes sex-differentially expressed in the cortex. De novo mutations were enriched in genes with male-biased expression in the adult cortex, but these genes did not show a significant sex difference on the liability scale, nor did the liability conferred by these genes differ significantly from other genes with similar loss-of-function intolerance and sex-averaged cortical expression. Exome-wide female bias in de novo protein-truncating mutation rates on the observed scale was driven by high-confidence and syndromic autism-predisposition genes. In summary, autosomal rare and damaging coding variants confer similar liability for autism in females and males.",

    "abstract": "Narratives have been widely acknowledged as a powerful persuasion tool in health promotion and education. Recently, great efforts have been devoted to identifying message components and causal pathways that maximize a narrative's persuasion power. Specifically, we investigated how narrator point of view and readers' subjective relative risk moderate the effects of protagonist competence on intentions to adopt osteoporosis-prevention behaviors, and proposed identification with the protagonist, self-referencing, and fear arousal as three mediators explaining the effect. Women aged 35 to 55, still young enough to reduce osteoporosis risk, read a narrative in which the 60-year-old female character reflects on either taking actions to prevent osteoporosis (competent protagonist) or failing to do so, resulting in osteoporosis (incompetent protagonist) (N = 563). The narratives were told from either the first- or third-person point of view. We found that women who perceived themselves to be at lower risk for developing osteoporosis relative to their peers identified more with the competent protagonist. For women at higher perceived risk, the competent and incompetent protagonists elicited similar levels of identification. Identification was higher when the protagonist's story was told from the first-person perspective, but only for the incompetent protagonist narrative. Identification, self-referencing, and fear arousal played important mediating roles. Implications for theory development and practice are examined.",

Two experiments manipulated the degree to which protest coverage adhered to the “protest paradigm.” One version presented the protesters as violent, unlawful, and disruptive; the other was more balanced. Group cause and news article’s source were also manipulated. Results from Study 1 showed that effects remained negative even when prior favorable attitudes toward the cause existed, with closely adherent coverage generally leading to more negative protester evaluations, lower levels of identification with protesters, and lower protest intention, often independent of participants’ prior attitudes. In contrast, Study 2 showed that the negative portrayals’ effects were rather inconsequential when participants’ ideology was considered.",

    "abstract": "Grindr is a popular geospatial networking application (GSNA) among gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men (GBMSM); it can be used for variety of goals (e.g. finding dates, making friends, or coordinating a hookup) depending on the user's wants. These needs and wants, however, do not arise in a vacuum. Informed by uses and gratification (U&G) theory, this paper examined individual factors such as race, body image and depression as drivers of the motivations behind Grindr usage In an online cross-sectional survey (N = 102), we explored the antecedents of six different motivations (i.e. friendship, sex, entertainment, romantic partnership, social inclusion, and location-based community) for Grindr use among GBMSM. The results revealed that romance and friendship motives increased Grindr usage compared to the other four motivation categories. Across motivation categories, habitual Grindr usage was a significant driver of continued Grindr use. Individual factors such as race, sociosexuality and self-disclosure also influenced users' motivations to use Grindr. Overall, the results point to individual factors eliciting differing motivations for Grindr use, resulting in either outcome-based or passive usage of the application.",

    "issued": "2023-11-29",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy poses a substantial threat to efforts to mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To combat vaccine hesitancy, officials in the United States issued vaccine mandates, which were met with strong antivaccine discourse on social media platforms such as Reddit. The politicized and polarized nature of COVID-19 on social media has fueled uncivil discourse related to vaccine mandates, which is known to decrease confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the moral foundations underlying uncivil COVID-19 vaccine discourse. Moral foundations theory poses that individuals make decisions to express approval or disapproval (ie, uncivil discourse) based on innate moral values. We examine whether moral foundations are associated with dimensions of incivility. Further, we explore whether there are any differences in the presence of incivility between the r/coronaviruscirclejerk and r/lockdownskepticism subreddits. METHODS: Natural language processing methodologies were leveraged to analyze the moral foundations underlying uncivil discourse in 2 prominent antivaccine subreddits, r/coronaviruscirclejerk and r/lockdownskepticism. All posts and comments from both of the subreddits were collected since their inception in March 2022. This was followed by filtering the data set for key terms associated with the COVID-19 vaccine (eg, \"vaccinate\" and \"Pfizer\") and mandates (eg, \"forced\" and \"mandating\"). These key terms were selected based on a review of existing literature and because of their salience in both of the subreddits. A 10% sample of the filtered key terms was used for the final analysis. RESULTS: Findings suggested that moral foundations play a role in the psychological processes underlying uncivil vaccine mandate discourse. Specifically, we found substantial associations between all moral foundations (ie, care and harm, fairness and cheating, loyalty and betrayal, authority and subversion, and sanctity and degradation) and dimensions of incivility (ie, toxicity, insults, profanity, threat, and identity attack) except for the authority foundation. We also found statistically significant differences between r/coronaviruscirclejerk and r/lockdownskepticism for the presence of the dimensions of incivility. Specifically, the mean of identity attack, insult, toxicity, profanity, and threat in the r/lockdownskepticism subreddit was significantly lower than that in the r/coronaviruscirclejerk subreddit (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that moral foundations may play a substantial role in the presence of incivility in vaccine discourse. On the basis of the findings of the study, public health practitioners should tailor messaging by addressing the moral values underlying the concerns people may have about vaccines, which could manifest as uncivil discourse. Another way to tailor public health messaging could be to direct it to parts of social media platforms with increased uncivil discourse. By integrating moral foundations, public health messaging may increase compliance and promote civil discourse surrounding COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Migratory waterfowl, including geese and ducks, are indicated as the primary reservoir of avian influenza viruses (AIv) which can be subsequently spread to commercial poultry. The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) surveillance efforts of waterfowl for AIv have been largely discontinued in the contiguous United States. Consequently, the use of technologies to identify areas of high waterfowl density and detect the presence of AIv in habitat such as wetlands has become imperative. Here we identified two high waterfowl density areas in California using processed NEXt generation RADar (NEXRAD) and collected water samples to test the efficacy of two tangential flow ultrafiltration methods and two nucleic acid based AIv detection assays. Whole-segment amplification and long-read sequencing yielded more positive samples than standard M-segment qPCR methods (57.6% versus 3.0%, p < .0001). We determined that this difference in positivity was due to mismatches in published primers to our samples and that these mismatches would result in failing to detect in the vast majority of currently sequenced AIv genomes in public databases. The whole segment sequences were subsequently used to provide subtype and potential host information of the AIv environmental reservoir. There was no statistically significant difference in sequencing reads recovered from the RexeedTM filtration compared to the unfiltered surface water. This overall approach combining remote sensing, filtration and sequencing provides a novel and potentially more effective, surveillance approach for AIv.",

    "abstract": "The canonical lytic-lysogenic binary has been challenged in recent years, as more evidence has emerged on alternative bacteriophage infection strategies. These infection modes are little studied, and yet they appear to be more abundant and ubiquitous in nature than previously recognized, and can play a significant role in the ecology and evolution of their bacterial hosts. In this review, we discuss the extent, causes and consequences of alternative phage lifestyles, and clarify conceptual and terminological confusion to facilitate research progress. We propose distinct definitions for the terms 'pseudolysogeny' and 'productive or non-productive chronic infection', and distinguish them from the carrier state life cycle, which describes a population-level phenomenon. Our review also finds that phages may change their infection modes in response to environmental conditions or the physiological state of the host cell. We outline known molecular mechanisms underlying the alternative phage-host interactions, including specific genetic pathways and their considerable biotechnological potential. Moreover, we discuss potential implications of the alternative phage lifestyles for microbial biology and ecosystem functioning, as well as applied topics such as phage therapy.",

    "abstract": "The recent CASP15 competition highlighted the critical role of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) in protein structure prediction, as demonstrated by the success of the top AlphaFold2-based prediction methods. To push the boundaries of MSA utilization, we conducted a petabase-scale search of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), resulting in gigabytes of aligned homologs for CASP15 targets. These were merged with default MSAs produced by ColabFold-search and provided to ColabFold-predict. By using SRA data, we achieved highly accurate predictions (GDT_TS > 70) for 66% of the non-easy targets, whereas using ColabFold-search default MSAs scored highly in only 52%. Next, we tested the effect of deep homology search and ColabFold's advanced features, such as more recycles, on prediction accuracy. While SRA homologs were most significant for improving ColabFold's CASP15 ranking from 11th to 3rd place, other strategies contributed too. We analyze these in the context of existing strategies to improve prediction.",

    "abstract": "For the first time, the 2022 CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) community experiment included a section on computing multiple conformations for protein and RNA structures. There was full or partial success in reproducing the ensembles for four of the nine targets, an encouraging result. For protein structures, enhanced sampling with variations of the AlphaFold2 deep learning method was by far the most effective approach. One substantial conformational change caused by a single mutation across a complex interface was accurately reproduced. In two other assembly modeling cases, methods succeeded in sampling conformations near to the experimental ones even though environmental factors were not included in the calculations. An experimentally derived flexibility ensemble allowed a single accurate RNA structure model to be identified. Difficulties included how to handle sparse or low-resolution experimental data and the current lack of effective methods for modeling RNA/protein complexes. However, these and other obstacles appear addressable.",

    "issued": "2023-12",
    "abstract": "CASP assessments primarily rely on comparing predicted coordinates with experimental reference structures. However, experimental structures by their nature are only models themselves-their construction involves a certain degree of subjectivity in interpreting density maps and translating them to atomic coordinates. Here, we directly utilized density maps to evaluate the predictions by employing a method for ranking the quality of protein chain predictions based on their fit into the experimental density. The fit-based ranking was found to correlate well with the CASP assessment scores. Overall, the evaluation against the density map indicated that the models are of high accuracy, and occasionally even better than the reference structure in some regions of the model. Local assessment of predicted side chains in a 1.52 Å resolution map showed that side-chains are sometimes poorly positioned. Additionally, the top 118 predictions associated with 9 protein target reference structures were selected for automated refinement, in addition to the top 40 predictions for 11 RNA targets. For both proteins and RNA, the refinement of CASP15 predictions resulted in structures that are close to the reference target structure. This refinement was successful despite large conformational changes often being required, showing that predictions from CASP-assessed methods could serve as a good starting point for building atomic models in cryo-EM maps for both proteins and RNA. Loop modeling continued to pose a challenge for predictors, and together with the lack of consensus amongst models in these regions suggests that modeling, in combination with model-fit to the density, holds the potential for identifying more flexible regions within the structure.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are one of the few mammalian species that are monogamous and engage in the biparental rearing of their offspring. Biparental care impacts the quantity and quality of care the offspring receives. The increased attention by the father may translate to heightened tactile contact the offspring receives through licking and grooming. METHODS: In the current study, we used electrophysiological multiunit techniques to define the organization of the perioral representation in the primary somatosensory area (S1) of prairie voles. Functional representations were related to myeloarchitectonic boundaries. RESULTS: Our results show that most of S1 is occupied by the representation of the contralateral mystacial whiskers and the lower and upper lips. The mystacial vibrissae representation encompassed a large portion of the caudolateral S1, while the representation of the lower and upper lips occupied a large portion of the rostrolateral aspect of S1. We found that neuronal populations representing the perioral structures tended to have small receptive fields relative to other body part representations on the head and that the representation of the mystacial whiskers and perioral structures was coextensive with cytoarchitectonically defined barrel fields that extend from the caudolateral to a rostrolateral aspect of S1. CONCLUSIONS: The relative magnification of the perioral representation in S1 reflects the importance of these regions for sensory-mediated behaviors such as tactile interactions in biparental care and social bonding. This highlights how environmental and behavioral factors shape S1 organization through brain-body synergy, suggesting that relatively small changes in experience can drive adaptive cortical plasticity that, over subsequent generations, drives the cortical phenotypic diversity across the rodent clade and mammals in general.",

    "abstract": "Primates are characterized by specializations for manual manipulation, including expansion of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and, in Catarrhines, evolution of a dexterous hand and opposable thumb. Previous studies examined functional interactions between motor cortex and PPC in New World monkeys and galagos, by inactivating M1 and evoking movements from PPC. These studies found that portions of PPC depend on M1 to generate movements. We now add a species that more closely resembles humans in hand morphology and PPC: macaques. Inactivating portions of M1 resulted in all evoked movements being reduced (28%) or completely abolished (72%) at the PPC sites tested (in areas 5L, PF, and PFG). Anterior parietal area 2 was similarly affected (26% reduced and 74% abolished) and area 1 was the least affected (12% no effect, 54% reduced, and 34% abolished). Unlike previous studies in New World monkeys and galagos, interactions between both nonanalogous (heterotopic) and analogous (homotopic) M1 and parietal movement domains were commonly found in most areas. These experiments demonstrate that there may be two parallel networks involved in motor control: a posterior parietal network dependent on M1 and a network that includes area 1 that is relatively independent of M1. Furthermore, it appears that the relative size and number of cortical fields in parietal cortex in different species correlates with homotopic and heterotopic effect prevalence. These functional differences in macaques could contribute to more numerous and varied muscle synergies across major muscle groups, supporting the expansion of the primate manual behavioral repertoire observed in Old World monkeys.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor cortex and anterior and posterior parietal cortex form a sensorimotor integration network. We tested the extent to which parietal areas could initiate movements independent of M1. Our findings support the contention that, although areas 2, 5L, PF, and PFG are highly dependent on M1 to produce movement, area 1 may constitute a parallel corticospinal pathway that can function somewhat independently of M1. A similar functional architecture may underlie dexterous tool use in humans.",

Notably their extremely altricial birth allows manipulation of postnatal pups at timepoints equivalent to embryonic stages of placental mammals. A robust literature exists on the development of short-tailed opossums, but many researchers working in the more conventional model species of mice and rats may find it daunting to identify the appropriate age at which to conduct experiments. METHODS: Here, we present detailed staging diagrams taken from photographic observations of 40 individual pups, in 6 litters, over 25 timepoints across postnatal development. We also present a comparative neurodevelopmental timeline of short-tailed opossums (M. domestica), the house mouse (Mus musculus), and the laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) during embryonic as well as postnatal development, using timepoints taken from this study and a review of existing literature, and use this dataset to present statistical models comparing the opossum to the rat and mouse. RESULTS: One aim of this research was to aid in testing the generalizability of results found in rodents to other mammalian brains, such as the more distantly related metatherians. However, this broad dataset also allows the identification of potential heterochronies in opossum development compared to rats and mice. In contrast to previous work, we found broad similarity between the pace of opossum neural development with that of rats and mice. We also found that development of some systems was accelerated in the opossum, such as the forelimb motor plant, oral motor control, and some aspects of the olfactory system, while the development of the cortex, some aspects of the retina, and other aspects of the olfactory system are delayed compared to the rat and mouse. DISCUSSION: The pace of opossum development is broadly similar to that of mice and rats, which underscores the usefulness of this species as a compliment to the more commonly used rodents. Many features that differ the most between opossums and rats and mice were either clustered around the day of birth and were features that have functional importance for the pup immediately after or during birth, or were features that have reduced functional importance for the pup until later in postnatal development, given that it is initially attached to the mother.",

    "abstract": "Bats have evolved behavioral specializations that are unique among mammals, including self-propelled flight and echolocation. However, areas of motor cortex that are critical in the generation and fine control of these unique behaviors have never been fully characterized in any bat species, despite the fact that bats compose ∼25% of extant mammalian species. Using intracortical microstimulation, we examined the organization of motor cortex in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a species that has evolved a novel form of tongue-based echolocation.1,2 We found that movement representations include an enlarged tongue region containing discrete subregions devoted to generating distinct tongue movement types, consistent with their behavioral specialization generating active sonar using tongue clicks. This magnification of the tongue in motor cortex is comparable to the enlargement of somatosensory representations in species with sensory specializations.3-5 We also found a novel degree of coactivation between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, both of which are involved in altering the shape and tension of wing membranes during flight. Together, these findings suggest that the organization of motor cortex has coevolved with peripheral morphology in bats to support the unique motor demands of flight and echolocation.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of sialadenectomy in a veteran population before and after introduction of sialendoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Veterans Affair (VA) Northern California Healthcare System (NCHS) encounters from 2006 to 2021 for benign obstructive salivary etiologies were identified using International Classification of Disease 9/10 codes. This cohort was then cross referenced with Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify patients who underwent a procedure for their salivary pathologies. The rates of sialadenectomy and minimally invasive procedures were measured before and after sialendoscopy was introduced to the VA NCHCS in 2016. Data was obtained via chart review and demographic information, diagnosis, and procedure type were extracted. Rates of sialadenectomy, minimally invasive procedures, and other patient and procedural characteristics were compared between the Pre-Sialendoscopy Era (PSE) and Sialendoscopy Era (SE). Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, version 16.66). RESULTS: An increasing number of patients per year sought care for benign obstructive salivary pathology in the SE when compared to the PSE cohort and a higher rate of female patients were treated in the SE cohort. A simultaneous reduction in sialadenectomy rates and increase in minimally invasive procedure rates was observed in the SE. Sialendoscopy represented most of the increase in minimally invasive techniques, but there was a slight increase in other procedure types. Submandibular gland obstructive pathologies required the most procedures and resulted in the most gland excisions. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review strongly suggests introducing sialendoscopy reduced the incidence of sialadenectomy for benign non-tumor obstructive pathology in this VA NCHS population. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate this in a more generalized setting.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Temporal bone mucosal melanomas (MMs) are rare, and patients may experience delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our objective was to better characterize the presentation, diagnosis, treatment modalities, and outcomes of this process. DATA SOURCES: PubMed/Medline, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and Web of Science databases were searched in all languages without restriction of publication dates. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria included that the article was either a case report or a case series with individual case data. All non-English articles were excluded if the corresponding abstract lacked data on demographics, initial presentation, and clinical management. DATA EXTRACTION: After full-text analysis, data pertaining to demographics, diagnosis, medical and surgical management modalities, and outcomes were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data were qualitatively synthesized, and means and averages were obtained for all continuous variables. Overall survival was measured by the Kaplan-Meier method, and significance was measured through log-rank testing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should suspect temporal bone MM in the differential diagnosis of patients with bloody otorrhea in the context of a chronic serous otitis media or an associated cranial nerve palsy. If suspected, physicians should not delay the acquisition of a biopsy or imaging studies. Management is highly variable and must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Outcomes remain poor because of the high propensity for MM to metastasize.",

STUDY DESIGN: This single-institution case series included 20 patients who underwent in-office bone-anchored hearing implant placement under local anesthesia from 2018 to 2021. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Northern California Healthcare System. METHODS: Following completion of the case series, patients were retrospectively surveyed regarding their satisfaction with this approach via a modified SSQ-8 (Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire) to fit our purposes. RESULTS: A total of 23 implants were completed in the in-office setting on 20 patients. Intra- and postoperative complication rates, including skin changes, irritation, infection, and poor wound healing, were similar to or better than currently published complication rates in the literature. In addition, patients reported overwhelmingly positive responses on the SSQ-8, almost universally stating that they were \"very satisfied\" with their clinic experience. CONCLUSION: This case series suggests that it is feasible and safe to complete this procedure in the clinic under local anesthesia, but further prospective studies are needed to evaluate this in a more generalized population.",

    "issued": "2022-09",
    "abstract": "Background: Temporal bone mucosal melanoma (MM) is exceedingly rare and presents with nonspecific symptoms with an insidious progression. For these reasons, patients with temporal bone MM may experience delays in diagnosis. Here, we present a case of temporal bone MM initially masquerading as chronic otomastoiditis. Case presentation: A 68-year-old male veteran with history of lymphoma, basal cell carcinoma, chronic hepatitis B, and significant smoking history without any family history of melanoma presented to the ED with ear pain and epistaxis. The patient returned to the same ED 4 more times before being seen by our institution's otolaryngology department. Here, the patient reported total right-sided hearing loss and a new right-sided CNV3 paresthesia. On microscopy, a violaceous mass was noted behind the tympanic membrane, and confirmed on imaging. Transcanal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of mucosal melanoma, and the patient was subsequently placed on ipilumumab/nivolumab therapy. After four months of immunotherapy and palliative care, the lesion was found to have enlarged, prompting additional radiotherapy. Conclusions: Temporal bone MM are often diagnosed later, with poorer survival outcomes when compared to their cutaneous equivalents. Surgical management is often limited by the presence of distant metastases and advanced locoregional involvement. Advancements in immunotherapeutic options are promising but limited to a few reports in the literature. Future research is required to better characterize the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of temporal bone MM.",

We expand genomic structural equation modeling to allow for testing genomic structural invariance (GSI), that is, the formal comparison of multivariate genetic architecture across groups. We apply GSI to compare the autosomal multivariate genetic architecture of eight psychiatric disorders spanning three factors (psychotic, neurodevelopmental and internalizing) between cisgender males and females. We find that the genetic factor structure is largely similar across sex, permitting meaningful comparisons of associations at the level of the factors. However, in females, problematic alcohol use and posttraumatic stress disorder loaded more strongly on the internalizing factor, while the neurodevelopmental disorder factor exhibited weaker genetic correlations with the other factors. Four phenotypes (educational attainment, insomnia, smoking and deprivation) showed significant, albeit small, sex-differentiated associations with the psychotic factor. As genome-wide association study samples grow and diversify, GSI will become increasingly valuable for comparing multivariate genetic architecture across groups.",

    "abstract": "Work surrounding the replicability and generalizability of network models has increased in recent years, prompting debate on whether network properties can be expected to be consistent across samples. To date, certain methodological practices may have contributed to observed inconsistencies, including use of single-item indicators and non-identical measurement tools. The current study used a resampling approach to disentangle the effects of sampling variability from scale variability when assessing network replicability in empirical data. Additionally, we explored whether consistencies in network characteristics were improved when more items were aggregated to estimate node scores, which we hypothesized should yield more representative measures of latent constructs. Overall, using different scales produced more variability in network properties than using different samples, but these discrepancies were markedly reduced with larger samples and greater node aggregation. Findings underscored the impact of aggregating items when estimating nodes: Multi-item indicators led to denser networks, higher network sensitivity, greater estimates of global strength, and greater levels of consistency in network properties (e.g., edge weights, centrality scores). Taken together, variability in network properties across samples may arise from poor measurement conditions; additionally, variability may reflect properties of the true network model and/or the measurement instrument.

    "abstract": "Psychometric networks can be estimated using nodewise regression to estimate edge weights when the joint distribution is analytically difficult to derive or the estimation is too computationally intensive. The nodewise approach runs generalized linear models with each node as the outcome. Two regression coefficients are obtained for each link, which need to be aggregated to obtain the edge weight (i.e., the conditional association). The nodewise approach has been shown to reveal the true graph structure. However, for continuous variables, the regression coefficients are scaled differently than the partial correlations, and therefore the nodewise approach may lead to different edge weights. Here, the aggregation of the two regression coefficients is crucial in obtaining the true partial correlation. We show that when the correlations of the two predictors with the control variables are different, averaging the regression coefficients leads to an asymptotically biased estimator of the partial correlation. This is likely to occur when a variable has a high correlation with other nodes in the network (e.g., variables in the same domain) and a lower correlation with another node (e.g., variables in a different domain). We discuss two different ways of aggregating the regression weights, which can obtain the true partial correlation: first, multiplying the weights and taking their square root, and second, rescaling the regression weight by the residual variances. The two latter estimators can recover the true network structure and edge weights.",

This preregistered study examined changes in time spent alone from 7th to 12th grade, as well as relationship and personality predictors of time spent alone in adolescence and loneliness in early adulthood, using data from a longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin youth in the United States, a rapidly growing yet understudied demographic. Time spent alone showed linear increases from 7th to 12th grade, with greater increases in time spent alone in high school for youth who spent a high proportion of time alone at the start of high school (9th grade). Greater time spent alone in 9th grade was significantly predicted by gender, lower peer relationship quality, parent-child support, parental warmth, higher parent-child conflict, parental hostility, and youth neuroticism. However, there were no significant predictors of change in time spent alone throughout the course of high school (from 9th to 12th grade). Lastly, loneliness in young adulthood was predicted by spending a high proportion of time alone, higher neuroticism, and lower extraversion in the 9th grade. Thus, time spent alone in adolescence may be a crucial early indicator of later loneliness.",

    "abstract": "Crotalid envenomation may result in airway compromise from angioedema, anaphylaxis, or an anaphylactoid reaction. A 57-year-old man was transported by helicopter to the emergency department (ED) after a bite to his hand from a severed rattlesnake head. He rapidly developed facial and oropharyngeal edema that did not respond to standard treatment. After 2 unsuccessful attempts at intubation, the dual flight nurse team performed a cricothyrotomy. They notified the ED team en route, and antivenom was prepared before arrival. Angioedema was suspected because there was no concomitant urticaria, bronchoconstriction, or persistent hypotension. Edema and ecchymosis of the affected extremity were mild. Severe coagulopathy ensued, which was treated with bolus doses of antivenom and continuous infusion. This case report is significant for several reasons. It is the first detailing a prehospital cricothyrotomy performed by flight crew nurses for life-threatening airway edema caused by snakebite envenomation. In-flight notification enabled the ED staff to prepare and administer antivenom immediately after arrival. Despite the use of antivenom in bolus dosing, crotalid envenomation may be complicated by persistent or recurring coagulopathy, and continuous antivenom infusion may be useful. Finally, it highlights the danger of snakebite envenomation even after the death and decapitation of a snake.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We test the hypotheses that use of the Chest Pain Choice (CPC) decision aid (DA) would be similarly effective in potentially vulnerable subgroups but increase knowledge more in patients with higher education and trust in physicians more in patients from racial minority groups. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial in adults with chest pain potentially due to acute coronary syndrome. The trial compared an intervention group engaged in shared decision making (SDM) using CPC to a control group receiving usual care (UC). We assessed for subgroup effects based on age, sex, race, income, insurance, education, literacy, and numeracy. We dichotomized each characteristic and tested for interactions using regression models with indicators for arm assignment and study site. RESULTS: Of 898 patients (451 DA, 447 UC), over 50% were female, over one-third were black, nearly one-third had a high school education or less, and over 60% had \"low\" health literacy. The DA did not increase knowledge more in patients with higher education ( P for interaction = 0.06) but did increase knowledge more in the \"typical\" than in the \"low\" numeracy subgroup (10.6% v. 4.7%, absolute difference [AD] = 5.9%, P for interaction = 0.025). The DA did not significantly increase patient trust in physicians in racial minorities ( P for interaction = 0.06) but did increase trust more in patients with \"low\" literacy compared with those with \"typical\" literacy (3.7% v. -1.4%, AD = 5.1, P for interaction = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: CPC benefited all sociodemographic groups to a similar extent, with greater knowledge transfer in patients with higher numeracy and greater physician trust in patients with \"low\" health literacy. Tailoring SDM interventions to patient characteristics may be necessary for optimal effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients at low risk for acute coronary syndrome are frequently admitted for observation and cardiac testing, resulting in substantial burden and cost to the patient and the health care system. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to measure the effect of the Chest Pain Choice (CPC) decision aid on overall health care utilization as well as utilization of specific services both during the index emergency department (ED) visit and in the subsequent 45 days. METHODS: This was a planned secondary analysis of data from a pragmatic multicenter randomized trial of shared decision making in adults presenting to the ED with chest pain who were being considered for observation unit admission for cardiac stress testing or coronary computed tomography angiography. The trial compared an intervention group engaged in shared decision making facilitated by the CPC decision aid to a control group receiving usual care. Hospital-level billing data were used to measure utilization for the index ED visit and during the following 45 days. Patients in both groups also were asked to keep a diary recording health care utilization over the same 45-day period. Outcomes assessed included length of time in the ED and observation, ED visits, office visits, hospitalizations, testing, imaging, and procedures. RESULTS: Of the 898 patients included in the original trial, we were able to contact 834 (92.9%) patients for 45-day health care diary review. There was no difference in patient-reported health care utilization between the study arms. Hospital-level billing data were obtained for all 898 (100%) patients. During the initial ED visit the length of stay (LOS) was similar, and there was no difference in the frequency of observation unit admission between study arms. However, the mean observation unit LOS was 95 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] = 40.8-149.8) shorter in the CPC arm and the mean number of tests was lower in the CPC arm (decrease in 19.4 imaging studies per 100 patients, 95% CI = 15.5-23.3). When evaluating the entire encounter and follow-up period, the intervention arm underwent fewer tests (decrease in 125.6 tests per 100 patients, 95% CI = 29.3-221.6). More specifically, there were fewer advanced cardiac imaging tests completed (25.8 fewer per 100 patients, 95% CI = 3.74-47.9) in the intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: Shared decision making in low-risk chest pain can lead to decreased diagnostic testing without worsening outcomes measured over 45 days.",

    "issued": "2018-07",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rhabdomyolysis and delayed acetaminophen hepatotoxicity may be associated with elevated serum transaminase values. Establishing the cause of elevated transaminases may be especially difficult because of limited or inaccurate histories of acetaminophen ingestion. We hypothesized that the comparative ratios of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can differentiate acetaminophen hepatotoxicity from rhabdomyolysis. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients in four hospitals from 2006 to 2011 with a discharge diagnosis of acetaminophen toxicity or rhabdomyolysis was performed. Subjects were classified into three groups: rhabdomyolysis, acetaminophen overdose (all), and acetaminophen overdose with undetectable serum acetaminophen concentrations [acetaminophen(delayed)]. Ratios of AST, ALT, and CK were compared using non-parametric statistical methods. RESULTS: 1,353 subjects were identified and after applying our exclusion criteria there were 160 in the rhabdomyolysis group, 68 in the acetaminophen overdose (all) group, and 29 in the acetaminophen (delayed) group. The AST/ALT ratio for the rhabdomyolysis group was 1.66 (Interquartile range: 1.18-2.22), for the acetaminophen overdose (all) group was 1.38 (1.08-1.69, statistically lower than the rhabdomyolysis group, p = 0.018), and for the acetaminophen (delayed)group was 1.30 (1.06-1.63, p = 0.037). CK/AST ratios were 21.3 (12.8-42.2), 5.49 (2.52-15.1, p < 0.001), and 3.80 (1.43-13.8, p < 0.001) respectively. CK/ALT ratios were 37.1 (16.1-80.0), 5.77 (2.79-25.2, p < 0.001), and 5.03 (2.20-17.4, p < 0.001) respectively. Increasing CK to transaminase ratio cutoffs resulted in increasing test sensitivity but lower specificity. CONCLUSION: AST/ALT, CK/AST and CK/ALT ratios are significantly larger in rhabdomyolysis when compared to patients with acetaminophen toxicity. This result suggests that the ratios could be used to identify patients with rhabdomyolysis who otherwise might have been diagnosed as delayed acetaminophen toxicity. Such patients may not require treatment with N-acetylcysteine, resulting in cost savings and improved resource utilization.",

In this study, we compared the effects of paraformaldehyde (PFA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) fixation techniques prior to HCR and IHC on chicken embryos. Our findings underscore the importance of optimizing fixation methods for accurate visualization and subsequent interpretation of HCR and IHC results, with implications for probe and antibody validation and tissue-specific protein localization studies. We found that TCA fixation resulted in larger and more circular nuclei and neural tubes compared to PFA fixation. Additionally, TCA fixation altered the subcellular fluorescence signal intensity of various proteins, including transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, and cadherins. Notably, TCA fixation revealed protein signals in tissues that may be inaccessible with PFA fixation. In contrast, TCA fixation proved ineffective for mRNA visualization. These results highlight the need for optimization of fixation protocols depending on the target and model system, emphasizing the importance of methodological considerations in biological analyses.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic exposures to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been linked to preterm birth, neural tube closure defects, abnormal enteric innervation, and craniofacial malformations, potentially due to disrupted neural tube or neural crest (NC) cell development. Naproxen (NPX), a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation, exerts its effects through non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. Our lab has identified that the cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) isoenzymes are expressed during the early stages of vertebrate embryonic development, and that global inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 function disrupts NC cell migration and differentiation in Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl) embryos. NC cells differentiate into various adult tissues including craniofacial cartilage, bone, and neurons in the peripheral and enteric nervous systems. To investigate the specific phenotypic and molecular effects of NPX exposure on NC development and differentiation, and to identify molecular links between COX inhibition and NC derivative anomalies, we exposed late neurula and early tailbud stage axolotl embryos to various concentrations of NPX and performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for markers of migratory and differentiating NC cells. Our results reveal that NPX exposure impairs the migration of SOX9+ NC cells, leading to abnormal development of craniofacial cartilage structures, including Meckel's cartilage in the jaw. NPX exposure also alters the expression of markers associated with peripheral and central nervous system (PNS and CNS) development, suggesting concurrent neurodevelopmental changes.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate development is regulated by several complex well-characterized morphogen signaling pathways, transcription factors, and structural proteins, but less is known about the enzymatic pathways that regulate early development. We have identified that factors from the inflammation-mediating cyclooxygenase (COX) signaling pathway are expressed at early stages of development in avian embryos. Using Gallus gallus (chicken) as a research model, we characterized the spatiotemporal expression of a subset of genes and proteins in the COX pathway during early neural development stages. Specifically, here we show expression patterns of COX-1, COX-2, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-2 (mPGES-2) as well as the genes encoding these enzymes (PTGS1, PTGS2, and PTGES-2). Unique expression patterns of individual players within the COX pathway suggest that they may play non-canonical/non-traditional roles in the embryo compared to their roles in the adult. Future work should examine the function of the COX pathway in tissue specification and morphogenesis and determine if these expression patterns are conserved across species.",

    "abstract": "The degree to which evolution repeats itself has implications regarding the major forces driving evolution and the potential for evolutionary biology to be a predictive (vs. solely historical) science. To understand the factors that control evolutionary repeatability, we experimentally evolved four replicate hybrid populations of sunflowers at natural sites for up to 14 years and tracked ancestry across the genome. We found that there was very strong negative selection against introgressed ancestry in several chromosomes, but positive selection for introgressed ancestry in one chromosome. Further, the strength of selection was influenced by recombination rate. High recombination regions had lower selection against introgressed ancestry due to more frequent recombination away from incompatible backgrounds. Strikingly, evolution was highly parallel across replicates, with shared selection driving 88% of variance in introgressed allele frequency change. Parallel evolution was driven by both high levels of sustained linkage in introgressed alleles and strong selection on large-effect quantitative trait loci. This work highlights the repeatability of evolution through hybridization and confirms the central roles that natural selection, genomic architecture, and recombination play in the process.",

Autophagy plays important roles in pathogenicity of various fungal pathogens, suggesting that autophagy is a novel target for development of antifungal compounds. Here, we describe bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based high-throughput screening (HTS) strategy to identify compounds that inhibit fungal ATG4 cysteine protease-mediated cleavage of ATG8 that is critical for autophagosome formation. We identified ebselen (EB) and its analogs ebselen oxide (EO) and 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (PT) as inhibitors of fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Magnaporthe oryzae ATG4-mediated ATG8 processing. The EB and its analogs inhibit spore germination, hyphal development, and appressorium formation in Ascomycota pathogens, B. cinerea, M. oryzae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Monilinia fructicola. Treatment with EB and its analogs significantly reduced fungal pathogenicity. Our findings provide molecular insights to develop the next generation of antifungal compounds by targeting autophagy in important fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Botrytis cinerea Pers. Fr. (teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana) is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that attacks a wide range of plants. This updated pathogen profile explores the extensive genetic diversity of B. cinerea, highlights the progress in genome sequencing, and provides current knowledge of genetic and molecular mechanisms employed by the fungus to attack its hosts. In addition, we also discuss recent innovative strategies to combat B. cinerea. TAXONOMY: Kingdom: Fungi, phylum: Ascomycota, subphylum: Pezizomycotina, class: Leotiomycetes, order: Helotiales, family: Sclerotiniaceae, genus: Botrytis, species: cinerea. HOST RANGE: B. cinerea infects almost all of the plant groups (angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes, and bryophytes). To date, 1606 plant species have been identified as hosts of B. cinerea. GENETIC DIVERSITY: This polyphagous necrotroph has extensive genetic diversity at all population levels shaped by climate, geography, and plant host variation. PATHOGENICITY: Genetic architecture of virulence and host specificity is polygenic using multiple weapons to target hosts, including secretory proteins, complex signal transduction pathways, metabolites, and mobile small RNA. DISEASE CONTROL STRATEGIES: Efforts to control B. cinerea, being a high-diversity generalist pathogen, are complicated. However, integrated disease management strategies that combine cultural practices, chemical and biological controls, and the use of appropriate crop varieties will lessen yield losses. Recently, studies conducted worldwide have explored the potential of small RNA as an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for combating grey mould. However, additional research is necessary, especially on risk assessment and regulatory frameworks, to fully harness the potential of this technology.",

    "abstract": "Eudicot plant species have leaves with two surfaces: the lower abaxial and the upper adaxial surface. Each surface varies in a diversity of components and molecular signals, resulting in potentially different degrees of resistance to pathogens. We tested how Botrytis cinerea, a necrotroph fungal pathogen, interacts with the two different leaf surfaces across 16 crop species and 20 Arabidopsis genotypes. This showed that the abaxial surface is generally more susceptible to the pathogen than the adaxial surface. In Arabidopsis, the differential lesion area between leaf surfaces was associated with jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling and differential induction of defense chemistry across the two surfaces. When infecting the adaxial surface, leaves mounted stronger defenses by producing more glucosinolates and camalexin defense compounds, partially explaining the differential susceptibility across surfaces. Testing a collection of 96 B. cinerea strains showed the genetic heterogeneity of growth patterns, with a few strains preferring the adaxial surface while most are more virulent on the abaxial surface. Overall, we show that leaf-Botrytis interactions are complex with host-specific, surface-specific, and strain-specific patterns.",

    "abstract": "Bidirectional flow of information shapes the outcome of the host-pathogen interactions and depends on the genetics of each organism. Recent work has begun to use co-transcriptomic studies to shed light on this bidirectional flow, but it is unclear how plastic the co-transcriptome is in response to genetic variation in both the host and pathogen. To study co-transcriptome plasticity, we conducted transcriptomics using natural genetic variation in the pathogen, Botrytis cinerea, and large-effect genetic variation abolishing defense signaling pathways within the host, Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that genetic variation in the pathogen has a greater influence on the co-transcriptome than mutations that abolish defense signaling pathways in the host. Genome-wide association mapping using the pathogens' genetic variation and both organisms' transcriptomes allowed an assessment of how the pathogen modulates plasticity in response to the host. This showed that the differences in both organism's responses were linked to trans-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) hotspots within the pathogen's genome. These hotspots control gene sets in either the host or pathogen and show differential allele sensitivity to the host's genetic variation rather than qualitative host specificity. Interestingly, nearly all the trans-eQTL hotspots were unique to the host or pathogen transcriptomes. In this system of differential plasticity, the pathogen mediates the shift in the co-transcriptome more than the host.",

    "issued": "2025-01",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a major consequence of head and neck cancer (HNC), often leading to decreased skeletal muscle mass and impacting survival. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of sarcopenia, as defined by skeletal muscle index (SMI), on survival in patients with HNC. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients with HNC treated with surgery and/or radiation at a single tertiary care institute. All had pre-treatment imaging available for skeletal muscle index (SMI) measurements, and SMI was calculated at the level of the 3rd cervical vertebra. Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI < 41 cm2/m2 in females and as <43 cm2/m2 in underweight or healthy weight males. Sarcopenia was defined as <53 cm2/m2 in overweight or obese males. Chi-square analysis was performed to compare recurrence and survival rates, and survival analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meir curve. RESULTS: Hundred and twelve patients with HNC were evaluated, 84 men and 28 women with an average age of 60.9 years. Tumors were primarily located in the oral cavity (24.1%) and oropharynx (42%). The majority (69.6%) underwent surgery. Mean body mass index prior to treatment was 28. Sixty-nine patients (61.6%) in our cohort had low SMI. Mean follow-up was 3.9 ± 2.2 years. Recurrence rate was 26% in those with low SMI versus 2% in those without. Patients with low SMI were more likely to have a recurrence (p = 0.02). Overall survival was 72.5% in those with low SMI and 81% in those with normal SMI (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Defining sarcopenia as a low skeletal muscle index at the third cervical vertebra is clinically relevant. This study demonstrates that low SMI at this level, and thus sarcopenia, was strongly associated with higher rates of recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Early detection and accurate diagnosis of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in head and neck cancer (HNC) are crucial for enhancing patient prognosis and survival rates. Current imaging methods have limitations, necessitating new evaluation of new diagnostic techniques. This study investigates the potential of combining pre-operative CT and intra-operative fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) to enhance LNM prediction in HNC using primary tumor signatures. Methods: CT and FLIm data were collected from 46 HNC patients. A total of 42 FLIm features and 924 CT radiomic features were extracted from the primary tumor site and fused. A support vector machine (SVM) model with a radial basis function kernel was trained to predict LNM. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using 10-fold nested cross-validation. Prediction performance was evaluated using balanced accuracy (bACC) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: The model, leveraging combined CT and FLIm features, demonstrated improved testing accuracy (bACC: 0.71, AUC: 0.79) over the CT-only (bACC: 0.58, AUC: 0.67) and FLIm-only (bACC: 0.61, AUC: 0.72) models. Feature selection identified that a subset of 10 FLIm and 10 CT features provided optimal predictive capability. Feature contribution analysis identified high-pass and low-pass wavelet-filtered CT images as well as Laguerre coefficients from FLIm as key predictors. Conclusions: Combining CT and FLIm of the primary tumor improves the prediction of HNC LNM compared to either modality alone. Significance: This study underscores the potential of combining pre-operative radiomics with intra-operative FLIm for more accurate LNM prediction in HNC, offering promise to enhance patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia, characterized by decreased skeletal muscle mass, is associated with poorer oncologic outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. The effect of sarcopenia on swallowing following HNC treatment is unknown. This study aims to investigate the association of sarcopenia and swallowing dysfunction in patients treated for HNC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center. METHODS: Pretreatment sarcopenia was assessed using the skeletal muscle index calculated from cross-sectional imaging at the third cervical vertebra. Feeding tube dependence, patient-reported dysphagia, and swallowing safety were assessed before and after treatment with the Functional Oral Intake Scale, Eating Assessment Tool-10, and Penetration Aspiration Scale, respectively. The association between sarcopenia and swallowing dysfunction was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were included, 84 males (75%) and 28 females (25%). A total of 69 (61.6%) had sarcopenia prior to initiating HNC therapy. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with an elevated risk of patient-reported dysphagia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.71 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.12-6.79]; P < .05). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that sarcopenia (OR = 15.18 [95% CI, 1.50-453.53]; P < .05) is an independent predictor for aspiration following treatment for HNC. CONCLUSION: Patients with pretreatment sarcopenia had higher rates of dysphagia before treatment and were more likely to develop aspiration after completion of HNC therapy. Sarcopenia is readily measured using cross-sectional imaging and may be useful for identifying patients at risk of swallowing dysfunction and those most likely to benefit from prehabilitation efforts.",

Specifically, we associate in a natural way an infinite family of integral packings of circles to any Kleinian group A ≤ PSL2(K) satisfying certain conditions, where K is an imaginary quadratic field, and show that the curvatures of the circles in any such packing satisfy an almost localto- global principle. A key ingredient in the proof is that A possesses a spectral gap property, which we prove for any infinite-covolume, geometrically finite, Zariski dense Kleinian group in PSL2(OK) containing a Zariski dense subgroup of PSL2(ℤ).",

The dynamical systems compute Gaussian rational approximations to complex numbers and are \"reflective\" versions of the complex continued fractions of A. L. Schmidt. They also describe a reduction algorithm for Lorentz quadruples, in analogy to work of Romik on Pythagorean triples. For these dynamical systems, we produce an invertible extension and an invariant measure, which we conjecture is ergodic. We consider some statistics of the related continued fraction expansions, and we also examine the restriction of these systems to the real line, which gives a reflective version of the usual continued fraction algorithm. Finally, we briefly consider an alternate setup corresponding to a tree of Lorentz quadruples ordered by arithmetic complexity.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder with genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Accumulating rare and genome-wide association study (GWAS) common risk variant information has yet to yield robust mechanistic insight. Leveraging large-scale gene deletion mouse phenomic data thus has potential to functionally interrogate and prioritize human disease genes. To this end, we applied a cross-species network-based approach to parse an extensive mouse gene set (188 genes) associated with disrupted prepulse inhibition (PPI), a Schizophrenia endophenotype. Integrating PPI genes with high-resolution mouse and human brain transcriptomic data, we identified functional and disease coherent co-expression modules through hierarchical clustering and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). In two modules, Schizophrenia risk and mouse PPI genes converged based on telencephalic patterning. The associated neuronal genes were highly expressed in cingulate cortex and hippocampus; implicated in synaptic function and neurotransmission and overlapped with the greatest proportion of rare variants. Concordant neuroanatomical patterning revealed novel core Schizophrenia-relevant genes consistent with the Omnigenic hypothesis of complex traits. Among other genes discussed, the developmental and post-synaptic scaffold TANC2 (Tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 2) emerged from both networks as a novel core genetic driver of Schizophrenia altering PPI. Aspects of psychiatric disease comorbidity and phenotypic heterogeneity are also explored. Overall, this study provides a framework and galvanizes the value of mouse preclinical genetics and PPI to prioritize both existing and novel human Schizophrenia candidate genes as druggable targets.",

    "issued": "2024",
    "abstract": "Despite a substantial body of research, we lack fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) including pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes, in part due to limitations of murine models. Most models use transgenic mice (K18) that express the human (h) angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), ACE2 knock-in (KI) mice, or mouse-adapted strains of SARS-CoV-2. Further, many SARS-CoV-2 variants produce fatal neurologic disease in K18 mice and most murine studies focus only on acute disease in the first 14 days post inoculation (dpi). To better enable understanding of both acute (<14 dpi) and post-acute (>14 dpi) infection phases, we describe the development and characterization of a novel non-lethal KI mouse that expresses both the ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes (hACE2/hTMPRSS2). The human genes were engineered to replace the orthologous mouse gene loci but remain under control of their respective murine promoters, resulting in expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 instead of their murine counterparts. After intranasal inoculation with an omicron strain of SARS-CoV-2, hACE2/hTMPRSS2 KI mice transiently lost weight but recovered by 7 dpi. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs 1-2 dpi and in lung tissues 2-6 dpi, peaking 4 dpi. These outcomes were similar to those in K18 mice that were inoculated in parallel. To determine the extent to which hACE2/hTMPRSS2 KI mice are suitable to model pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes, physiological assessments measuring locomotion, behavior and reflexes, biomonitoring to measure cardiac activity and respiration, and micro computed tomography to assess lung function were conducted frequently to 6 months post inoculation. Male but not female SARS-CoV-2 inoculated hACE2/hTMPRSS2 KI mice showed a transient reduction in locomotion compared to control saline treated mice. No significant changes in respiration, oxygen saturation, heart rate variability, or conductivity were detected in SARS-CoV-2 inoculated mice of either sex. When re-inoculated 6 months after the first inoculation, hACE2/hTMPRSS2 KI became re-infected with disease signs similar to after the first inoculation. Together these data show that a newly generated hACE2/hTMPRSS2 KI mouse can be used to study mild COVID-19.",

The ARRIVE guidelines outline documentation standards for laboratory animals in experiments, but genetic information is often incomplete. To remedy this, we propose the Laboratory Animal Genetic Reporting (LAG-R) framework. LAG-R aims to document animals' genetic makeup in scientific publications, providing essential details for replication and appropriate model use. While verifying complete genetic compositions may be impractical, better reporting and validation efforts enhance reliability of research. LAG-R standardization will bolster reproducibility, peer review, and overall scientific rigor.",

    "abstract": "The Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC)Live Program was established in 2023 by the National Institute for Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to advance biomedical research by providing the scientific community with standardized, high quality phenotyping services for mouse models of diabetes and obesity. Emerging as the next iteration of the MMPC Program which served the biomedical research community for 20 years (2001-2021), MMPCLive is designed as an outwardly-facing consortium of service cores that collaborate to provide reduced-cost consultation and metabolic, physiologic, and behavioral phenotyping tests on live mice for U.S. biomedical researchers. Four MMPCLive Centers located at universities around the country perform complex and often unique procedures in vivo on a fee for service basis, typically on mice shipped from the client or directly from a repository or vendor. Current areas of expertise include energy balance and body composition, insulin action and secretion, whole body carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cardiovascular and renal function, food intake and behavior, microbiome and xenometabolism, and metabolic pathway kinetics. Additionally, an opportunity arose to reduce barriers to access and expand the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by establishing the VIBRANT Program. Directed at researchers historically underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, VIBRANT-eligible investigators have access to testing services, travel and career development awards, expert advice and experimental design consultation, and short internships to learn test technologies. Data derived from experiments run by the Centers belongs to the researchers submitting mice for testing which can be made publicly available and accessible from the MMPCLive database following publication. In addition to services, MMPCLive staff provide expertise and advice to researchers, develop and refine test protocols, engage in outreach activities, publish scientific and technical papers, and conduct educational workshops and training sessions to aid researchers in unraveling the heterogeneity of diabetes and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Effective cover crop termination by roller crimping remains a challenge in organic no-till systems. Slow decomposition of surface residues can delay planting and lead to competition for soil resources. Little research has investigated the potential for application of microbial inoculants to promote residue decomposition and accelerate C and N cycling. Two field studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of microbial inoculants on cover crop residue decomposition, labile soil carbon (POXC) and inorganic N pools, and sweet potato yield under contrasting environmental conditions. In a fall termination study, vermicompost tea, a microbial inoculant (EM-1), and thermophilic compost tea were applied after roller crimping sorghum-sudangrass. In a spring termination study, vermicompost tea, EM-1, and a treatment with tillage were applied after roller crimping a multispecies cover crop mixture. Results indicate there was no effect of the microbial tea treatments on the rate of residue decomposition or soil inorganic N and POXC concentrations in either study. However, soil ammonium-N and nitrate-N concentrations were significantly higher in the tilled vs. roller crimped treatments in the spring termination study. Moreover, POXC increased significantly over time in the fall termination study but decreased in the spring termination study. There were no differences in sweet potato yield among microbial inoculants or between the roller crimped and tilled treatments. These results provide insights into the limitations of promoting cover crop decomposition following roller crimping in organic no-till systems to enhance labile C and inorganic N pools while improving yield of the succeeding cash crop.",

    "issued": "2024-01",
    "abstract": "Crop rotation is one strategy for adapting agroecosystems to a framework that balances ecological diversity, sustainability, and food production. The Sacramento Valley, one of the most productive rice growing regions in the US, faces sustainability challenges including increasing herbicide resistant weed pressure and water use restrictions. Increasing crop diversity may help address these challenges, but this region has unique soil attributes including high clay content, salinity, alkalinity, and cemented subsurface layers, and the degree to which these soil properties influence crop rotation decisions remain unclear. The objectives of this study were to quantify the extent of crop rotation in this region, compare soil properties for rotated and continuous rice fields, and assess the potential for expanding rotations based on the geographic coverage of influential soil variables. Using satellite derived land cover data for 2007–2021, our analysis shows that only ∼5000 ha are in rotation with rice, while 220,000 ha are in continuous rice production. This land cover information is fused with SSURGO soil maps in a spatial random forest model. The modeling approach indicates that fields with soil pH between 6.5 and 8, EC between 0.5 and 2 (ds m-1), and saturated hydraulic conductivity less than 2 (μm s-1) are more likely to be rotated. However, we estimate that only 11% of the continuous rice area has all three of these soil properties combined, suggesting soil limitations are an important constraint. This research highlights a method for evaluating land use decisions in relation to spatial variability of soil properties to better understand barriers to agroecological diversification.",

    "abstract": "Biochar is promoted as a means of improving soil fertility. Yet, few experiments have investigated its potential to improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency for high-yielding maize production in the U.S. Midwest. We tested the hypothesis that biochar application increases inorganic soil N availability during maize growth, leading to higher grain yields and N recovery efficiency while reducing the risk of N leaching following harvest. Four N fertilizer rates (0, 90, 179, and 269 kg ha−1 as urea ammonium nitrate [UAN] solution) were applied with or without biochar (10 Mg ha−1) before planting in a two-year field study. Inorganic soil N concentration was measured during the growing season (0–15 cm), and deep soil cores were obtained following harvest (0–90 cm). Results show that biochar did not affect maize yield, crop N uptake, or N recovery efficiency (by the difference method) across N rates, and there was no biochar by N rate interaction. While biochar lowered soil inorganic N concentrations on several sampling dates, this did not translate into seasonal differences in cumulative soil N availability, although grain yields in the unfertilized control were ~10% lower with biochar, suggesting net N immobilization. Biochar partially reduced the risk of N leaching following harvest by decreasing soil N concentrations at 30–60 cm, but mean concentrations for 0–90 cm were not different. Compared to previous work highlighting the benefits of biochar in arid climates with low soil fertility, we found no evidence of increased crop yield, NRE, or reduced risk of N leaching on Mollisols in a temperate climate.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have addressed whether in-field practices to reduce nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching might increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which could undermine attempts to mitigate agricultural N pollution. Over a 3-year period, we assessed the impacts of N application timing and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop on subsurface drainage NO3-N leaching and N2O emissions to quantify changes in total N loss and corresponding social and environmental damage costs under continuous corn (Zea mays L.). While NO3-N losses were reduced by 37% with the combination of in-season split N application and cereal rye cover crop relative to pre-season N application, soil N2O emissions increased by 26%, highlighting a tradeoff between N loss pathways. As a result, total N losses and social and environmental damage costs from each system were not different. These results demonstrate the importance of addressing agricultural N pollution using a holistic framework accounting for the environmental and social risks of both NO3-N losses and N2O emissions.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural phosphorus (P) loss, which is highly variable in space and time, has been studied using the hot spot/hot moment concept, but increasing the rigor of these assessments through a relatively newer \"ecosystem control point\" framework may help better target management practices that provide a disproportionate water quality benefit. Sixteen relatively large (0.85 ha) subsurface drainage plots in Illinois were used as individual observational units to assess dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations and losses within a given field over four study years. Three plot-months were identified as DRP control points (one export and two transport control points), where each plot-month contributed >10% of the annual DRP load from the field. These control points occurred on separate plots and in both the growing and nongrowing seasons but were likely related to agronomic P applications. Elevated soil test P, especially near a historic farmstead, and soil clay content were spatial drivers of P loss across the field. The nongrowing season was hypothesized to be the most significant period of P loss, but this was only documented in two of the four study years. A cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop did not significantly reduce DRP loss in any year, but there was also no evidence of increased drainage P losses due to freezing and thawing of the cover crop biomass. This work confirmed annual subsurface drainage DRP losses were agronomically small (<3% of P application rate), although the range of DRP concentrations relative to eutrophication criteria still demonstrated a potential for negative environmental impact. The control point concept may provide a new lens to view drainage DRP losses, but this framework should be refined through additional within-field studies because mechanisms of P export at this field were more nuanced than just the presence of tile drainage (i.e., a transport control point).",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Low bone mineral density is highly prevalent in sickle cell disease (SCD); whether bisphosphonates can safely preserve or increase bone mass in SCD adults remains unknown. In this study, lumbar spine bone density remained stable with alendronate use, and treatment-related side effects were mostly mild and self-limited. PURPOSE: To describe the effects of alendronate in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and osteoporosis. METHODS: We reviewed retrospective clinical data from adults with SCD and osteoporosis treated with alendronate at a single center in Brazil (2009-2019). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. We analyzed BMD changes by alendronate treatment duration (months), stratified by sex, skeletal site, and SCD genotype. RESULTS: Sixty-four SCD adults with osteoporosis (69% females, 73% HbSS, mean age ± standard deviation 42.4 ± 10.9 years) received alendronate for a median (interquartile range) of 48 (29, 73) months. Compared with males, females had significantly lower baseline BMD (g/cm2) at the femoral neck (0.72 vs 0.85, p =  < 0.001) and total hip (0.79 vs 0.88, p = 0.009). The between-sex differences in BMD changes were insignificant. Mean lumbar spine BMD significantly changed by 0.0357 g/cm2 (p = 0.028) in those on alendronate for > 5 years. Four adults (6.3%) reported mild therapy-related side effects. An atypical femoral diaphysis fracture, attributed to alendronate, was incidentally noted in a 37-year-old man on treatment for 4 years. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort of adults with SCD and osteoporosis on alendronate for a median of 48 months, we found no significant interactions between sex and changes in lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip BMD with alendronate. Lumbar spine BMD was stable in those on alendronate for < 5 years. Side effects of alendronate were mild, though one patient developed an atypical femoral fracture.",

    "abstract": "Neurovascular complications, including strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), are common and cause significant morbidity in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) (1998) established chronic transfusions as the standard of care for children with SCD at high risk for stroke. Using statewide data from the California Department of Health Care Access and Innovation (1991-2019), we determined the cumulative incidence (CMI) and rates of primary and recurrent strokes/TIAs in people with SCD pre- and post-STOP trial. For the 7636 patients included in our SCD cohort, the cumulative incidence of the first ischemic stroke was 2.1% by the age of 20 years and 13.5% by the age of 60 years. The CMI of the first intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was 0.5% and 6.8% by the age of 20 and 60 years, respectively. Ischemic stroke rates increased in children (age <18 years; 234.9 vs 165.1 per 100 000 patient years [PY]; P = .012) and adults (age 31-50 years; 431.1 vs 303.2 per 100 000 PY; P = .031) in 2010 to 2019 when compared with the preceding decade. There was an increase in the rates of ICH in those aged 18 to 30 years and TIA in children <18 years from 2010 to 2019 when compared with the previous decade. Risk factors for strokes included increasing age, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. These findings underscore the need for stroke prevention in adults with SCD, suggesting an emphasis on management of modifiable cerebrovascular risk factors that have been proven to be effective in the general population.",

We previously showed that low bone mineral density (BMD) independently associates with hip ON and chronic pain in a pediatric SCD cohort. We now present preliminary data on the association between low BMD and pain in a prospective cohort of adults enrolled in the SCD Bone Pain Study (NCT05283148).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, who were recruited from ambulatory adults with SCD seen at the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. All participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of their lumbar spine, left hip, and left forearm. Vertebral fractures were assessed by thoracolumbar morphometry in the DXA scanner. All participants also completed the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-Me) Pain Impact questionnaire. We used linear regression to evaluate the association between ASCQ-Me pain scores and low BMD (categorically defined as BMD Z-score ≤ -2 at any DXA site). We also used linear regression to determine the association between ASCQ-Me pain scores and continuous total hip and lumbar spine BMD Z-scores. Lastly, we evaluated the impact of other covariates on pain scores, with low BMD or BMD Z-scores included in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO, no shrinkage).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Thirty adults (median age 34.5 years [20-67 years]) completed the study between Nov 2022-Jul 2023. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. There was a borderline significant association between low BMD and lower (worse) pain scores (p=0.077). Continuous BMD Z-scores of the total hip (p=0.081) and lumbar spine (p=0.024) were independently associated with higher (better) pain scores. In addition to low BMD, only white blood cell count (WBC), indirect bilirubin, and vitamin D were identified as possible covariates (all had non-zero coefficients in LASSO analysis). Low BMD was significantly associated with pain (p=0.024), even after adjusting for WBC, indirect bilirubin, and vitamin D (Table 2). Similarly, we found that higher hip (p=0.059) and lumbar (p=0.027) BMD Z-scores were associated with higher (better) pain scores, despite adjusting for the same confounders.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Discussion:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We found low BMD in 12 of 30 (40%) adults enrolled in the SCD Bone Pain Study. Like other chronic hemolytic anemias, compensatory increased erythropoiesis leads to trabeculae degradation, cortical bone thinning, and eventual low bone mass. Lumbar vertebrae comprises mostly of trabecular bone, while the hip joint has mostly cortical bone. This might explain why mean lumbar BMD Z-scores were lower than hip BMD Z-scores (Table 1), and why lumbar spine BMD Z-scores directly and significantly correlated with pain scores (Table 2). These preliminary data suggest that pain is more prevalent in SCD adults with low BMD than those with normal BMD as we previously reported in a pediatric SCD cohort.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Pain scores decrease (worsen) with increasing WBC, which suggests an inflammatory component to chronic SCD pain. Contrary to expectation, higher indirect bilirubin (a marker of increased hemolysis) significantly correlated with higher (better) pain scores. Similarly, higher vitamin D (a proxy for bone health) correlated with lower (worse) pain scores, though this association was non-significant. The reason(s) for these counterintuitive associations between pain scores, indirect bilirubin, and vitamin D levels is currently unknown.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Limitations include a small sample size, though using the LASSO method for multivariate regression adjusted for this. Further, low BMD causality could not be determined at this time. Recruitment is ongoing with an enrollment target of 50 adults with SCD by Nov 2023. Analysis are ongoing to determine if SCD-modifying therapies will impact the association between low BMD and pain. Bone biomarker studies are also pending. Further, the thoracolumbar morphometry is still undergoing radiologic review, so we can further assess how vertebral compression fractures (i) correlate with pain scores, and/or (ii) attenuate the association between low BMD and pain. Identifying and treating risk factors for low BMD may alleviate bone pain and potentially improve quality of life for all people with SCD.</jats:p>",

    "issued": "2023-11-02",
    "abstract": "<jats:title/>\n               <jats:p>Background: Air pollution is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes in the general population such as asthma exacerbations, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and stroke. There is a strong association between air pollution and mechanistic processes associated with oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, and inflammation, suggesting a high risk of exposure for those with sickle cell disease (SCD). A small number of published studies have explored this relationship, primarily focusing on children. Only two studies have examined air pollution in the US, both with outcomes among urban area hospitals in Atlanta, GA. None have taken place in California, which has the worst air quality, including the four most polluted cities in year-round particle pollution in the nation. Additionally, all published studies have overlooked more rural exposure areas. Recent advances in environmental exposure assessment have enabled high-resolution predictions of ambient air pollution concentrations in the whole US, making it possible to cover unmonitored suburban and rural areas that were unrepresented in the past. In addition, these high-resolution predictions are more precise surrogates of the personal exposure measures than monitored data. Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5) is the most harmful pollutant based on current research findings. We hypothesized that short term increases in PM 2.5 exposure were associated with an increased risk for hospitalization among individuals with SCD in California.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods: We designed a time-stratified case-crossover study to estimate the percent change in risk for hospitalization for SCD complications associated with each 1mg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 exposure. The zip code of residence was used to spatially link each hospital admission with PM 2.5 exposure using a novel hybrid exposure model allowing for estimated exposure in areas without direct remote sensing. We used conditional logistic regressions to examine the PM 2.5 exposures at 7-day moving average and single lag days (from lag 0 to 6 days) before admission, adjusting for nonlinear confounding effects of air temperature and humidity at the same exposure window. We examined risk for all hospitalizations and specifically for vaso-occlusive pain (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: From 2000-2016, among 5,835 California residents with SCD, there were 107,450 admissions for sickle cell disease complications with VOC being the most common indication (71.1%). PM 2.5 air pollution data was examined among 2,634 zip codes throughout the state. Residents with SCD were noted to be living among 1,180 zip codes. The daily burden of PM 2.5 was higher in zip codes with residents with SCD (mean 11.5 mg/m 3, standard deviation [SD] 9.0) when compared to zip codes without residents known to have SCD (mean 9.2 mg/m 3, SD 8.6, p&amp;lt;0.001) ( Table 1). Overall, the mean daily burden of PM 2.5 declined in the period of 2010-2016 when compared to that from 2000-2009. However, the daily mean PM 2.5 concentration remained higher in zip codes with individuals with SCD. No significant association was seen in examining the week-long exposure to PM 2.5 and increase risk in hospitalizations for any indication over the entire study period (2000-2016). However, when examining the more contemporary period of 2010-2016, we identified that each 1mg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 was associated with 0.22% increased risk for SCD hospitalization (Confidence Interval [CI] 0.02-0.42, p=0.03) 3 days prior to admission. We observed a 0.26% increased risk for hospitalization for VOC with each 1 mg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 exposure (CI 0.02-0.49, p=0.03) at lag day 3 (Figure 1). No effect was seen with PM 2.5 on hospitalizations for ACS during any time period.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Discussion: Our study suggests that short term air pollution exposure may be a trigger for hospitalization for individuals with SCD. In particular this effect is seen in the more recent years with a lower daily average PM 2.5 burden overall, suggesting attention may be needed well below Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) thresholds. Consistent with previous studies, lag day 3 PM 2.5 exposure is associated with an increased risk for hospitalization for VOC. These results may have important implications in understanding risk factors for hospitalization for children and adults with SCD.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are important tools with diverse uses in biomedical research. However, open access to reliable sources of well-characterized antibodies with unambiguous molecular identities remains an obstacle to research transparency and reproducibility. We propose here a community shift towards open-source antibodies, analogous to open-source computer software. The tenets of such antibodies are that 1) they are available to researchers in a ready to use form, 2) the renewable source of the antibody (e.g., hybridoma cells or plasmid) is also widely available ensuring reproducible and cost-effective access to the same antibody, and 3) the antibody sequence is publicly available. With these criteria met, the antibody can be widely used with the transparent assurance associated with a molecularly defined reagent, and the code can be edited to generate antibody variants to meet researchers' specific needs. We (the UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility, the Development Studies Hybridoma Bank, and Addgene) have established a consortium to provide open-source access to a large collection of well characterized antibodies. As open-source software has benefitted both users and developers, we suggest open-source antibodies will have a similar positive impact on antibody based biomedical research. We encourage funding agencies to support initiatives to expand access to open-source antibody resources, and researchers to both utilize and to contribute to them, with a goal of enabling more reliable and cost-effective pursuit of research.",

    "issued": "2025-03-26",
    "abstract": "Voltage-gated K+ channels of the Kv2 family are highly expressed in brain and play dual roles in regulating neuronal excitability and in organizing endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions. Studies in heterologous cells suggest that Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 co-assemble with \"electrically silent\" KvS subunits to form heterotetrameric channels with distinct biophysical properties, but the prevalence and localization of these channels in native neurons are unknown. Here, using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified five KvS subunits as components of native Kv2.1 channels immunopurified from mouse brain of both sexes, the most abundant being Kv5.1. We found that Kv5.1 co-immunoprecipitates with Kv2.1 and to a lesser extent with Kv2.2 from brain lysates and that Kv5.1 protein levels are decreased by 70% in Kv2.1 knock-out mice and 95% in Kv2.1/Kv2.2 double knock-out mice. RNAscope and immunolabeling revealed that Kv5.1 is prominently expressed in neocortex, where it is detected in a substantial fraction of Kv2.1/Kv2.2 positive neurons in layers 2/3, 5, and 6. At the subcellular level, Kv5.1 protein is coclustered with Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 at presumptive ER-PM junctions on the soma and proximal dendrites of cortical neurons. Moreover, in addition to modifying channel conductance, we found that Kv2/Kv5.1 channels are less phosphorylated and insensitive to RY785, a potent and selective Kv2 channel inhibitor. Together, these findings demonstrate that KvS subunits create multiple Kv2 channel subtypes in brain. Most notably, Kv2/Kv5.1 channels are highly expressed in cortical neurons, where their unique properties likely modulate the critical conducting and nonconducting roles of Kv2 channels.",

While volume electron microscopy (vEM) can reveal the fine structure of neuronal networks (connectomics), it does not provide molecular information to identify cell types or functions. We developed an approach that uses fluorescent single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) to perform multiplexed detergent-free immunolabeling and volumetric-correlated-light-and-electron-microscopy on the same sample. We generated eight fluorescent scFvs targeting brain markers. Six fluorescent probes were imaged in the cerebellum of a female mouse, using confocal microscopy with spectral unmixing, followed by vEM of the same sample. The results provide excellent ultrastructure superimposed with multiple fluorescence channels. Using this approach, we documented a poorly described cell type, two types of mossy fiber terminals, and the subcellular localization of one type of ion channel. Because scFvs can be derived from existing monoclonal antibodies, hundreds of such probes can be generated to enable molecular overlays for connectomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Antibody (Ab)-based imaging techniques rely on reagents whose performance may be application specific. Because commercial antibodies are validated for only a few purposes, users interested in other applications may have to perform extensive in-house antibody testing. Here, we present a novel application-specific proxy screening step to efficiently identify candidate antibodies for array tomography (AT), a serial section volume microscopy technique for high-dimensional quantitative analysis of the cellular proteome. To identify antibodies suitable for AT-based analysis of synapses in mammalian brain, we introduce a heterologous cell-based assay that simulates characteristic features of AT, such as chemical fixation and resin embedding that are likely to influence antibody binding. The assay was included into an initial screening strategy to generate monoclonal antibodies that can be used for AT. This approach simplifies the screening of candidate antibodies and has high predictive value for identifying antibodies suitable for AT analyses. In addition, we have created a comprehensive database of AT-validated antibodies with a neuroscience focus and show that these antibodies have a high likelihood of success for postembedding applications in general, including immunogold electron microscopy. The generation of a large and growing toolbox of AT-compatible antibodies will further enhance the value of this imaging technique.",

    "abstract": "Large foundation models show promise in biomedicine but face challenges in clinical use due to performance gaps, accessibility, cost, and lack of scalable evaluation. Here we show that open-source small multimodal models can bridge these gaps in radiology by generating free-text findings from chest X-ray images. Our data-centric approach leverages 697K curated radiology image-text pairs to train a specialized, domain-adapted chest X-ray encoder. We integrate this encoder with pre-trained language models via a lightweight adapter that aligns image and text modalities. To enable robust, clinically relevant evaluation, we develop and validate CheXprompt, a GPT-4-based metric for assessing factual accuracy aligned with radiologists' evaluations. Benchmarked with CheXprompt and other standard factuality metrics, LLaVA-Rad (7B) achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming much larger models like GPT-4V and Med-PaLM M (84B). While not immediately ready for real-time clinical deployment, LLaVA-Rad is a scalable, privacy-preserving and cost-effective step towards clinically adaptable multimodal AI for radiology.",

    "abstract": "Traditional quadruped robots are known for their agile movement and versatility across varied terrains. However, their foot structures struggle to navigate unstructured terrains such as pipes, slopes, and protrusions. This paper proposes a novel tensegrity foot structure consisting of a tensegrity ankle joint and an X-shaped adaptive tensegrity footpad, which enhances the terrain adaptability of legged robots. The equilibrium equation of the ankle joint is established, and the relationship between the translational stiffness of the ankle joint and the spring stiffness is derived. Additionally, a mathematical model for the number of X-shaped tensegrity footpad units and their relationship with the deformation height and length of the tensegrity footpad is established. A physical prototype of the tensegrity foot was fabricated using 3D printing. Experiments are conducted to validate the adaptability of both the ankle joint and the tensegrity footpad. The results indicate that the proposed adaptive tensegrity foot structure exhibits good adaptability on unstructured terrains with varying radii, slopes, steps, S-curves, and spherical surfaces. The tensegrity foot structure can enhance the environmental adaptability of quadruped robots and has excellent impact resistance effects.",

    "issued": "2025",
    "abstract": "With the advent and widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the imperative to ensure their safety has become increasingly pronounced. However, with the integration of additional modalities, MLLMs are exposed to new vulnerabilities, rendering them prone to structured-based jailbreak attacks, where semantic content (e.g. “harmful text”) has been injected into the images to mislead MLLMs. In this work, we aim to defend against such threats. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Shield Prompting (AdaShield), which prepends inputs with defense prompts to defend MLLMs against structure-based jailbreak attacks without fine-tuning MLLMs or training additional modules (e.g., post-stage content detector). Initially, we present a manually designed static defense prompt, which thoroughly examines the image and instruction content step by step and specifies response methods to malicious queries. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive auto-refinement framework, consisting of a target MLLM and a LLM-based defense prompt generator (Defender). These components collaboratively and iteratively communicate to generate a defense prompt. Extensive experiments on the popular structure-based jailbreak attacks and benign datasets show that our methods can consistently improve MLLMs’ robustness against structure-based jailbreak attacks without compromising the model’s general capabilities evaluated on standard benign tasks. Our code is available at https://rain305f.github.io/AdaShield-Project.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces an approach for assessing the stability of tensegrity structures by examining local and global buckling behaviors. We employ the minimal coordinate to parameterize the tensegrity configuration, incorporating nodal displacement and local bending deformation. A detailed formulation of the potential energy for tensegrity structures is presented under compression, tension, and bending. The formulation of the equilibrium equation is obtained using the principle of stationary total potential energy. Further, we study the stiffness characteristic of the structure by developing the tangent stiffness matrix. The equilibrium and stiffness of tensegrity structures with consideration of initially crooked members are derived. Our findings indicate that local and global buckling behaviors remain independent in perfect straight axial force member assumptions while they become coupled with consideration of initially crooked members. The critical buckling load of tensegrity structures under external load can be calculated by a generalized eigenvalue problem. The proposed method is also applicable to cable nets, trusses, and space frames.",

    "abstract": "Southern sea otters (SSO: Enhydra lutris nereis) are a federally-listed threatened subspecies found almost exclusively in California, USA. Despite their zoonotic potential and lack of host specificity, K. pneumoniae and Klebsiella spp. have largely unknown epizootiology in SSOs. Klebsiella pneumoniae is occasionally isolated at necropsy, but not from live SSOs. Hypermucoviscous (HMV) K. pneumoniae strains are confirmed pathogens of Pacific Basin pinnipeds, but have not been previously isolated from SSOs. We characterized the virulence profiles of K. pneumoniae isolates from necropsied SSOs, evaluated killing of marine mammal K. pneumoniae following in vitro exposure to California sea lion (CSL: Zalophanus californianus) whole blood and serum, and characterized lesion patterns associated with Klebsiella spp. infection in SSOs. Four of 15 SSO K. pneumoniae isolates were HMV and all were recovered from SSOs that stranded during 2005. Many K. pneumoniae infections were associated with moderate to severe pathology as a cause of death or sequela. All HMV infections were assessed as a primary cause of death or as a direct result of the primary cause of death. Klebsiella-infected SSOs exhibited bronchopneumonia, tracheobronchitis and/or pleuritis, enteritis, Profilicollis sp. acanthocephalan peritonitis, septic peritonitis, and septicemia. All SSO HMV isolates were capsular type K2, the serotype most associated with HMV infections in CSLs. Multiplex PCR revealed two distinct virulence gene profiles within HMV isolates and two within non-HMV isolates. In vitro experiments investigating CSL whole blood and serum killing of K. pneumoniae suggest that HMV isolates are more resistant to serum killing than non-HMV isolates.",

    "abstract": "Peninsular bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) are found exclusively in Southern California and Baja Mexico. They are federally endangered due to multiple threats, including introduced infectious disease. From 1981 - 2017, we conducted surveillance for 16 pathogens and estimated population sizes, adult survival, and lamb survival. We used mixed effects regression models to assess disease patterns at the individual and population levels. Pathogen infection/exposure prevalence varied both spatially and temporally. Our findings indicate that the primary predictor of individual pathogen infection/exposure was the region in which an animal was captured, implying that transmission is driven by local ecological or behavioral factors. Higher Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae seropositivity was associated with lower lamb survival, consistent with lambs having high rates of pneumonia-associated mortality, which may be slowing population recovery. There was no association between M. ovipneumoniae and adult survival. Adult survival was positively associated with population size and parainfluenza-3 virus seroprevalence in the same year, and orf virus seroprevalence in the previous year. Peninsular bighorn sheep are recovering from small population sizes in a habitat of environmental extremes, compounded by infectious disease. Our research can help inform future pathogen surveillance and population monitoring for the long-term conservation of this population.",

    "abstract": "Accurate, timely, and cost-effective blood chemistry analysis is an essential tool for directing emergency treatment, monitoring the health status of captive and free-ranging individuals and flocks, and improving the efficacy of conservation actions. Blood samples were obtained from 52 canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) that were captured on San Francisco Bay, California, during December 2017 as part of a long-term study. Reference values and clinical agreement were determined for blood chemistry and plasma protein parameters among four commonly used point-of-care devices (VetScan® VS2, i-STAT®, AlphaTRAK®2 glucometer, refractometer) and two gold standard laboratory analyzers (Roche cobas® c501, Helena SPIFE 3000 system). Canvasback reference values were generally within expected ranges for Anatidae species with the exception of higher upper limits for sodium and chloride. Creatine kinase and aspartate transaminase values exceeded a published threshold for diagnosis of capture myopathy even though study birds were captured using low-stress techniques and successfully released. With the exception of higher alkaline phosphatase in hatch-year canvasbacks, no age or sex differences were observed for any analyte in this population that was captured during a nonbreeding period. Analysis of analyzer agreement found raw VetScan aspartate transaminase, calcium, glucose, and uric acid values; corrected VetScan albumin, potassium, sodium, and total protein values; raw i-STAT glucose and potassium values; and corrected i-STAT sodium and chloride values were clinically interchangeable with Roche cobas values. Raw VetScan and i-STAT glucose values were also interchangeable. However, none of the Roche or point-of-care analyzer plasma protein values were in clinical agreement with gold standard electrophoresis values. The findings of this study highlight the need for analyzer- or technique-specific reference values and provide biologists and veterinarians quantitative reference values using currently available analyzers to better assess and respond to the health of individuals and populations.",

    "abstract": "In the wake of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, a number of government agencies, academic institutions, consultants, and nonprofit organizations conducted lab- and field-based research to understand the toxic effects of the oil. Lab testing was performed with a variety of fish, birds, turtles, and vertebrate cell lines (as well as invertebrates); field biologists conducted observations on fish, birds, turtles, and marine mammals; and epidemiologists carried out observational studies in humans. Eight years after the spill, scientists and resource managers held a workshop to summarize the similarities and differences in the effects of DWH oil on vertebrate taxa and to identify remaining gaps in our understanding of oil toxicity in wildlife and humans, building upon the cross-taxonomic synthesis initiated during the Natural Resource Damage Assessment. Across the studies, consistency was found in the types of toxic response observed in the different organisms. Impairment of stress responses and adrenal gland function, cardiotoxicity, immune system dysfunction, disruption of blood cells and their function, effects on locomotion, and oxidative damage were observed across taxa. This consistency suggests conservation in the mechanisms of action and disease pathogenesis. From a toxicological perspective, a logical progression of impacts was noted: from molecular and cellular effects that manifest as organ dysfunction, to systemic effects that compromise fitness, growth, reproductive potential, and survival. From a clinical perspective, adverse health effects from DWH oil spill exposure formed a suite of signs/symptomatic responses that at the highest doses/concentrations resulted in multi-organ system failure.",

    "abstract": "Despite years of research, hop creep remains largely enigmatic to brewers and academics alike. This study adds a new dimension to this complex story with the discovery and quantification of starch within the bract of hop cones. Although glycosyl hydrolase enzymes from hops, are considered the main drivers of hop creep by breaking down complex sugars into fermentable ones, it was previously thought that these enzymes only acted on dextrins derived from malt during the mash. However, this study herein reveals that starch from the hop bract itself provides a previously unconsidered substrate, significantly impacting hop creep by contributing potential additional fermentable sugars. To confirm the presence of starch, hop products were stained with iodine. In addition, starch content and the monosaccharides involved in starch synthesis were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Starch was identified in hop bracts (mesophyll and stomatal guard cells) with visual confirmation using microscopy with the bracts stained with iodine. In addition, total starch (<0.5 to 1.6 g/100 g) and monosaccharide sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) were quantified in the bracts. The presence of starch provides unequivocal evidence that the enzymes responsible for hop creep are from the hop cone. This research emphasizes the potential additional role of starch in understanding the mechanisms underlying hop creep, contributing new additional insights to hops.",

    "abstract": "Beer has over 600 flavor compounds and creates a positive tasting experience with acceptable sensory properties, which are essential for the best consumer experience. Spontaneous and mixed-culture fermentation beers, generally classified as sour beers, are gaining popularity compared to typical lager or ale styles, which have dominated in the USA for the last few decades. Unique and acceptable flavor compounds characterize sour beers, but some unfavorable aspects appear in conjunction. One such unfavorable flavor is called \"mousy\". This description is usually labeled as an unpleasant odor, identifying spoilage of fermented food and beverages. It is related as having the odor of mouse urine, cereal, corn tortilla chips, or freshly baked sour bread. The main compounds responsible for it are N-heterocyclic compounds: 2-acetyltetrahydropyridine, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, and 2-ethyltetrahydropyridine. The most common beverages associated with mousy off-flavor are identified in wines, sour beers, other grain-based beverages, and kombucha, which may contain heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, and/or yeast/fungus cultures. In particular, the fungal species Brettanomyces bruxellensis are associated with mousy-off flavor occurrence in fermented beverages matrices. However, many factors for N-heterocycle formation are not well-understood. Currently, the research and development of mixed-cultured beer and non/low alcohol beverages (NABLAB) has increased to obtain the highest quality, sensory, functionality, and most notably safety standards, and also to meet consumers' demand for a balanced sourness in these beverages. This paper introduces mousy off-flavor expression in beers and beverages, which occurs in spontaneous or mixed-culture fermentations, with a focus on sour beers due to common inconsistency aspects in fermentation. We discuss and suggest possible pathways of mousy off-flavor development in the beer matrix, which also apply to other fermented beverages, including non/low alcohol drinks, e.g., kombucha and low/nonalcohol beers. Some precautions and modifications may prevent the occurrence of these off-flavor compounds in the beverage matrix: improving raw material quality, adjusting brewing processes, and using specific strains of yeast and bacteria that are less likely to produce the off-flavor. Conceivably, it is clear that spontaneous and mixed culture fermentation is gaining popularity in industrial, craft, and home brewing. The review discusses important elements to identify and understand metabolic pathways, following the prevention of spoilage targeted to off-flavor compounds development in beers and NABLABs.",

    "abstract": "Mousy off-flavor describes N-heterocycles compounds related to spoilage in the brewing industry. It has also been identified in sour beers through sensory analysis. Therefore, preventing spoilage N-heterocycles development is essential to preserve end-products and obviate economic losses. To this day, no methods or protocols have been reported to identifying mousy off-flavor compounds in a beer matrix. The main objective of this work was to develop a standardized quantification method for 2-acetyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (ATHP) in beer matrix, by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry with Electrospray Ionization (LC-MS-ESI). Extraction of ATHP in the samples was performed using QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) technique. Over a dozen different potentially mousy cask-aged sour beers including other spontaneously fermented beverages were provided, based on sensory analysis, to determine the variation in ATHP levels. Results indicated ATHP was found in all the samples, ranging from 1.64 ± 0.06 to 57.96 ± 2.15 µg L-1. Herein, we described our detection method of mousy-off flavor compounds which enables future research to mitigate the occurrence of such defects in fermented beverages matrix.•ATHP content in samples varied from 1.64 ± 0.06 to 57.96 ± 2.15 µg L-1.•The recovery range of ATHP using LC-MS-ESI varied from 71% to 97%.•Basified QuEChERS salting-out procedure is applicable for ATHP extraction from beer and other fermented beverages matrices.",

Sixteen proteins with storage, DNA/RNA binding, or enzymatic functions were significantly higher/lower in abundance (compared to the overall mean) in the Yolo 3 and Imperial Valley locations, Butta 12 and LCS Odyssey genotypes, and the 2017-18 and 2021-22 years. Individual protein abundances were reasonably predictive (RMSECV = 1.25-2.04%) for total, alcohol-soluble, and malt protein content and malt fine extract.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are a better tool for evaluating the experiences of patients who have symptomatic, treatment-associated adverse events (AEs) compared with clinician-rated AEs. The authors present PROs assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and treatment-related neurotoxicity for adjuvant capecitabine versus platinum on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) EA1131 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02445391). METHODS: Participants completed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer Symptom Index (NFBSI-16) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gynecologic Oncology Group neurotoxicity subscale (platinum arm only) at baseline, cycle 3 day 1 (C3D1), 6 months, and 15 months. Because of early termination, power was insufficient to test the hypothesis that HRQoL, as assessed by the NFBSI-16 treatment side-effect (TSE) subscale, would be better at 6 and 15 months in the capecitabine arm; all analyses were exploratory. Means were compared by using t-tests or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and proportions were compared by using the χ2 test. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-six of 330 eligible patients provided PROs. The mean NFBSI-16 TSE subscale score was lower for the platinum arm at baseline (p = .02; absolute difference, 0.6 points) and for the capecitabine arm at C3D1 (p = .04; absolute difference, 0.5 points), but it did not differ at other times. The mean change in TSE subscale scores differed between the arms from baseline to C3D1 (platinum arm, 0.15; capecitabine arm, -0.72; p = .03), but not from baseline to later time points. The mean decline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gynecologic Oncology Group neurotoxicity subscale scores exceeded the minimal meaningful change (1.38 points) from baseline to each subsequent time point (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the similar frequency of clinician-rated AEs, PROs identified greater on-treatment symptom burden with capecitabine and complemented clinician-rated AEs by characterizing patients' experiences during chemotherapy.",

    "issued": "2023-02",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are effective in germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation-associated metastatic breast cancer. However, studies evaluating PARP inhibitors plus platinum-based chemotherapy in germline BRCA1/2-wildtype triple-negative breast cancer are scarce. A large proportion of germline BRCA1/2-wildtype triple-negative breast cancer shows homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), resulting in a BRCA-like phenotype that might render sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The S1416 trial assessed the efficacy of cisplatin combined with the PARP inhibitor veliparib in three predefined groups of metastatic breast cancer: germline BRCA1/2-mutated, BRCA-like, and non-BRCA-like. METHODS: S1416 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial conducted at 154 community and academic clinical sites across the USA. Eligible patients aged 18 years or older had metastatic or recurrent triple-negative breast cancer or germline BRCA1/2-associated metastatic or recurrent breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had received up to one line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via the National Clinical Trials Network open interactive system with dynamic balancing on number of previous cytotoxic regimens for metastatic disease to receive intravenous cisplatin (75 mg/m2, day 1) combined with either veliparib or matching placebo (300 mg orally twice a day, days 1-14) on a 21-day cycle. Investigators, patients, and the sponsors were masked to treatment assignment; the study statisticians were unmasked. Central testing after ran domisation classified patients as having mutated or wildtype germline BRCA1/2. A biomarker panel established a priori was used to classify patients with wildtype germline BRCA1/2 into BRCA-like and non-BRCA-like phenotype groups, with BRCA-like status based on at least one of the biomarkers: genomic instability score (≥42), somatic BRCA1/2 mutations, BRCA1 promoter methylation, or non-BRCA1/2 homologous recombination repair germline mutations. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, analysed separately for the three predefined biomarker groups with a prespecified α value for each analysis. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and included all eligible patients. Safety analyses of toxicities attributed to treatment included all patients who received at least one dose of veliparib or placebo. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02595905. FINDINGS: Between July 7, 2016, and June 15, 2019, 335 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. 320 patients (n=162 to cisplatin plus veliparib, all women; and n=158 to cisplatin plus placebo, 157 women and one man) were eligible for efficacy evaluation. 247 patients were classified into the three biomarker groups: germline BRCA1/2-mutated (n=37), BRCA-like (n=101), and non-BRCA-like (n=109). 73 patients could not be classified due to missing biomarker information. Median follow-up was 11·1 months (IQR 5·6-20·8). In the germline BRCA1/2-mutated group, median progression-free survival was 6·2 months (95% CI 2·3-9·2) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group and 6·4 months (4·3-8·2) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·79 [95% CI 0·38-1·67]; log-rank p=0·54). In the BRCA-like group, median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 4·3-7·8) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group versus 4·2 months (2·3-5·0) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·57 [95% CI 0·37-0·88]; p=0·010). In the non-BRCA-like group, median progression-free survival was 4·0 months (95% CI 2·5-4·7) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group versus 3·0 months (2·2-4·4) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·60-1·33]; p=0·57). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events attributed to treatment were neutropenia (71 [46%] of 155 patients in the cisplatin plus veliparib group vs 29 [20%] of 147 in the cisplatin plus placebo group), leukopenia (42 [27%] vs 11 [7%]), anaemia (35 [23%] vs 12 [8%]), and thrombocytopenia (29 [19%] vs four [3%]). Serious adverse events attributed to treatment occurred in 48 (31%) patients in the cisplatin plus veliparib group and 53 (36%) patients in the cisplatin plus placebo group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in one patient in the cisplatin plus veliparib group (sepsis) and one patient in the cisplatin plus placebo group (acute kidney injury due to cisplatin plus heart failure from previous doxorubicin exposure). INTERPRETATION: The addition of veliparib to cisplatin significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with BRCA-like metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but not in patients with non-BRCA-like metastatic breast cancer. PARP inhibitors combined with platinum-based chemotherapy should be explored further in BRCA-like triple-negative breast cancer.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is standard treatment for locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). We hypothesized that adding sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antitumor and antiangiogenic activity, to an anthracycline and taxane regimen would improve pathologic complete response (pCR) rates to a prespecified endpoint of 45% in patients with HER2-negative LABC or IBC. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, phase II trial of neoadjuvant sunitinib with paclitaxel (S+T) followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF for patients with HER2-negative LABC or IBC. Patients received sunitinib 25 mg PO daily with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV weekly ×12 followed by doxorubicin 24 mg/m2 IV weekly + cyclophosphamide 60 mg/m2 PO daily with G-CSF support. Response was evaluated using pCR in the breast and the CPS + EG score (clinical-pathologic scoring + estrogen receptor [ER] and grade). RESULTS: Seventy patients enrolled, and 66 were evaluable for efficacy. Eighteen patients (27%) had pCR in the breast (10 had ER+ disease and 8 had triple-negative disease). When defining response as pCR and/or CPS + EG score ≤2, 31 (47%) were responders. In pateints with ER positive disease, 23 (64%) were responders. The most common toxicities were cytopenias and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant S+T followed by AC+G-CSF was safe and tolerable in LABC and IBC. The study did not meet the prespecified endpoint for pCR; however, 47% were responders using pCR and/or CPS + EG score ≤2. ER positive patients had the highest response rate (64%). The addition of sunitinib to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may provide promising incremental benefit for patients with ER positive LABC.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrence after resection of metastatic sarcoma is common. The gangliosides GM2, GD2 and GD3 are strongly expressed across sarcoma subtypes. We hypothesised that generation of anti-ganglioside antibodies would control micrometastases and improve outcomes in sarcoma patients who were disease-free after metastasectomy. METHODS: We conducted a randomised phase II trial of the immunological adjuvant OPT-821 with a KLH-conjugated ganglioside vaccine targeting GM2, GD2 and GD3, versus OPT-821 alone in patients with metastatic sarcoma following complete metastasectomy. Patients received 10 subcutaneous injections at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, 28, 40, 52, 68 and 84 and were followed for evidence of recurrent disease. The primary end-point was relapse-free survival. Secondary end-points included overall survival and serologic response. RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were randomised, 68 to each arm. The mean age was 51.2, 52.2% were male, 90.4% had relapsed disease, 86.8% had high-grade tumours and 14% had ≥4 metastases resected. Histologies included leiomyosarcoma (33%), spindle cell sarcoma (14%), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (13%), osteosarcoma (10%), synovial sarcoma (9%), liposarcoma (9%) and others (12%). Most adverse events were Grade ≤2 (83.8% and 70.6% in the vaccine and adjuvant arms, respectively). The most common (≥20% of patients) were injection site reaction (89.7%), fatigue (44.1%) and pyrexia (27.9%) on the vaccine arm, and injection site reaction (69.1%) on the adjuvant only arm. The 1-year relapse-free survival rate (34.5% and 34.8% in the vaccine and OPT-821 monotherapy arm, respectively) did not differ between arms (P = 0.725). One-year overall survival rates were 93.1% and 91.5% in the vaccine and OPT-821 monotherapy arm, respectively (P = 0.578). Serologic responses at week 9 were more frequent on the vaccine arm (96.5% of patients) than in the adjuvant arm (32.8%), and the difference between groups was durable. CONCLUSIONS: A sustained serologic response to vaccination was induced with the vaccine, but no difference in recurrence-free or overall survival was observed between treatment arms.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and residual invasive disease (RD) after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have a high-risk for recurrence, which is reduced by adjuvant capecitabine. Preclinical models support the use of platinum agents in the TNBC basal subtype. The EA1131 trial hypothesized that invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) would not be inferior but improved in patients with basal subtype TNBC treated with adjuvant platinum compared with capecitabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinical stage II or III TNBC with ≥ 1 cm RD in the breast post-NAC were randomly assigned to receive platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) once every 3 weeks for four cycles or capecitabine 14 out of 21 days every 3 weeks for six cycles. TNBC subtype (basal v nonbasal) was determined by PAM50 in the residual disease. A noninferiority design with superiority alternative was chosen, assuming a 4-year iDFS of 67% with capecitabine. RESULTS: Four hundred ten of planned 775 participants were randomly assigned to platinum or capecitabine between 2015 and 2021. After median follow-up of 20 months and 120 iDFS events (61% of full information) in the 308 (78%) patients with basal subtype TNBC, the 3-year iDFS for platinum was 42% (95% CI, 30 to 53) versus 49% (95% CI, 39 to 59) for capecitabine. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were more common with platinum agents. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial as it was unlikely that further follow-up would show noninferiority or superiority of platinum. CONCLUSION: Platinum agents do not improve outcomes in patients with basal subtype TNBC RD post-NAC and are associated with more severe toxicity when compared with capecitabine. Participants had a lower than expected 3-year iDFS regardless of study treatment, highlighting the need for better therapies in this high-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization in China since 1980 generated environmental pressures of non-point source pollution (NPSP) and increased wide public concerns. Excessive quantities of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is a significant source of aquatic pollution, despite of their roles as essential nutritional elements for aquatic life processes. In this study, we present a new framework using random forest (RF) as a powerful machine learning algorithm driven by geo-datasets to estimate and map the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) at a spatial resolution for the Wen-Rui Tang River (WRTR) watershed, which is a typically urban-rural transitional area in east coastal region of China. A comprehensive GIS database of 26 in-house built environmental variables was adopted to build the predictive models of TN and TP in open waters over the watershed. The performances of the RF regression models were evaluated in comparison with in-situ measurements, and the results indicated the ability of RF regression models to accurately predict the spatiotemporal distribution of N and P concentration in rivers. Charactering the explanatory variable importance measures in the calibrated RF regression model defined the most significant variables impacting N and P contaminations in open waters across the urban-rural transitional area, and the results showed that these variables are aquaculture, direct domestic sewage, industrial wastewater discharges and the changing meteorological variables. Besides, mapping of the TN and TP concentrations across the continuous river at high spatiotemporal resolution (daily, 1 km × 1 km) in this study were informative. The results in this study provided the valuable data to various different stakeholders for managing water quality and pollution control where similar regions with rapid urbanization and a lack of water quality monitoring datasets.",

    "abstract": "This research provides the first assessment of the environmental fate and transport of agricultural pesticide formulation agents following a dynamic modeling approach. Two formulation agents of toxicological concern, Naphthalene and Solvent Naphtha (Petroleum), Heavy Aromatic, were simulated from their usage in commercially-applied pesticides. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate these formulation agents during 2011-2014 in the agriculturally intensive Sacramento River watershed. The sensitivity and uncertainty of some key parameters were analyzed. The predicted transport masses of these formulation agents in surface water were strongly associated with rainfall. While predicted transport masses were quite small at the watershed scale (<0.01% of applied masses), they were 26-31 times higher in certain locales at the subbasin level. Since many formulation agents are widely used in pesticides throughout this and other agriculturally impacted watersheds, their potential risks in the environment need more thorough investigation by modeling and monitoring, especially for areas with heavy usage.",

    "abstract": "China has experienced a rapid period of urbanization since the 1980s. Many traditional agricultural areas were transformed into the urban-rural transitional areas, in which both urban and rural characteristics exist. Non-point source pollution (NPSP) has become a major side effect of urbanization and agricultural production which caused wide public concerns. It is crucial to carry out research on identifying the spatiotemporal variation in NPSP in the urban-rural transitional area (especially in developing countries, e.g., in China), which is a prerequisite for improving water quality and guiding NPSP control efforts. Modeling approaches are great tools to provide quantitative information on NPSP and optimize the best management practices for NPSP control. We reviewed over twenty years of publications on NPSP modeling and applications in urban, rural and its transitional areas. The strengths and limitations of 20 commonly used NPSP models in China were concluded based on a brief introduction and the evolution history. Reporting the strengths and weaknesses of each NPSP model could enhance its utility in practice. In terms of the unique characteristics of urban-rural transitional areas, which are neither strictly urban nor rural, non-point source pollutants are often distinctly different between traditional pollutants from urban and agricultural areas since the great differences in the hydrological processes, and none of existing NPSP models are fully applicable to urban-rural transitional areas. Based on limited NPSP modeling studies in urban-rural transitional areas, the existing research insufficiency were technical and mechanism limitations of the model despite of numerous improvements in the past, concerns about simulation accuracy, limited investigations on new pollutants, and lack of monitoring data. Future development trend and concerns of NPSP models for urban-rural transitional areas were discussed, which could be of great help to the development of NPSP models and their applications in water quality management in the rapid urbanized China.",

    "abstract": "Nitrate pollution is of considerable global concern as a threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems. Nowadays, δ15N/δ18O-NO3- combined with a Bayesian-based SIAR model are widely used to identify riverine nitrate sources. However, little is known regarding the effect of variations in pollution source isotopic composition on nitrate source contributions. Herein, we used δ15N/δ18O-NO3-, SIAR modeling, probability statistical analysis and a perturbing method to quantify the contributions and uncertainties of riverine nitrate sources in the Wen-Rui Tang River of China and to further investigate the model sensitivity of each nitrate source. The SIAR model confirmed municipal sewage (MS) as the major nitrate source (58.5-75.7%). Nitrogen fertilizer (NF, 8.6-20.9%) and soil nitrogen (SN, 7.8-20.1%) were also identified as secondary nitrate sources, while atmospheric deposition (AD, <0.1-7.9%) was a minor source. Uncertainties associated with NF (UI90 = 0.32) and SN (UI90 = 0.30) were high, whereas those associated with MS (UI90 = 0.14) were moderate and AD low (UI90 = 0.0087). A sensitivity analysis was performed for the SIAR modeling and indicated that the isotopic composition of the predominant source (i.e., MS in this study) had the strongest effect on the overall riverine nitrate source apportionment results.",

    "abstract": "Increased use of pyrethroids in the Central Coast of California since 2011 has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number and proportion of surface water samples with detectable concentrations at levels of concern to the public and state regulators. The goals of this study were to investigate the relationships between pyrethroid usage and environmental contamination, quantify and assess the potential risks, and recommend mitigation strategies. This study compiled the available pyrethroid use and surface water sampling data for the region, and then applied GIS methods to dynamic simulation modeling and usage-restriction buffer analyses. The results showed that in Monterey County alone, the agricultural usages of bifenthrin and permethrin each increased by ~50%, and the positive detection frequencies of both also increased around 2011-2013. County-wide, bifenthrin positive detections in surface water samples increased precipitously from 8.2% (7/85) for 2008-2012 up to 36.4% (106/291) for 2013-2017, and detections above its crustacean LC50 concentration went from 7.1% (6/85) to 35.7% (104/291). Despite its higher usage by mass, comparable figures for permethrin were more modest for the same time-periods, with positive detections going from 10.6% (9/85) to 14.4% (64/444), and detections above its crustacean LC50 going from 3.5% (3/85) to 7.2% (32/444). The seasonal lag between high bifenthrin usage in spring/summer and high detections in fall/winter samples showed the best correlations with 128- to 182-day lag times. This timing suggests that fallow season rain is likely the main driver of pyrethroid off-site movement into surface waters. SWAT modeling indicated that significant reductions in surface water permethrin concentrations only occurred with buffer distances of 1.6-3.2 km, but not with narrower buffers. However, if those wider buffers were implemented, permethrin could no longer be used on the majority of land where it is currently applied. Specifically, a 1.6-km buffer reduced the instream concentration by 8% but impacted 50% of the cropland, and a 3.2-km buffer reduced the concentration by 50% while impacting 76% of cropland. This study suggested that more promising alternative management practices could include an overall reduction in pyrethroid usage back to 2011 levels or other active mitigation strategies, like planting cover crops during the fallow winter wet season, or installing either vegetated buffer strips and/or sediment check dams on small tributaries to minimize sediment runoff.",

    "issued": "2025-01",
    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are highly comorbid in people with epilepsy. However, the mechanisms mediating the shared pathophysiology are currently unknown. There is considerable evidence implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the network communication of anxiety and fear, a process demonstrated to involve parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. The loss of PV interneurons has been well described in the hippocampus of chronically epileptic mice and in postmortem human tissue of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We hypothesize that a loss of PV interneurons in the BLA may contribute to comorbid mood disorders in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model of TLE in mice, which exhibits profound behavioral deficits associated with chronic epilepsy. We demonstrate a loss of PV interneurons and dysfunction of the remaining PV interneurons in the BLA of chronically epileptic mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate altered principal neuron function and impaired coordination of BLA network and behavioral states in chronically epileptic mice. To determine whether the loss of PV interneurons contributes to these altered network and behavioral states, we partially ablated PV interneurons in the BLA by stereotaxically injecting AAV-Flex-DTA into the BLA of PV-Cre mice. Loss of PV interneurons in the BLA is sufficient to alter behavioral states, such as increasing avoidance behaviors and impairing fear learning. These data suggest that compromised inhibition in the BLA in chronically epileptic mice may contribute to behavioral deficits, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to comorbid anxiety and epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the circadian pacemaker of the mammalian brain. Suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons display synchronization of their firing frequency on a circadian timescale, which is required for the pacemaker function of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. However, the mechanisms by which suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons remain synchronized in vivo are poorly understood, although synaptic communication is considered indispensable. Suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons contain the neurotransmitter GABA and express GABA receptors. This has inspired the hypothesis that GABA signalling may play a central role in network synchronization, although this remains untested in vivo. Here, using local genetic deletion, we show that disruption of GABA synaptic transmission within the suprachiasmatic nucleus of adult mice results in the eventual deterioration of physiological and behavioural rhythmicity in vivo and concomitant cellular desynchrony in vitro. These findings suggest that intercellular GABA signalling is essential for behavioural rhythmicity and cellular synchrony of the suprachiasmatic nucleus neural network.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks are emerging as tools for assessing acceleration and deceleration of biological age during childhood. Maternal depression during pregnancy may affect the biological aging of offspring and related development. In a low-income cohort of mother-child dyads, we investigated the relationship between prenatal maternal depressive symptoms and infant epigenetic age residuals, which represent the deviation (acceleration or deceleration) that exists between predicted biological age and chronological age. The epigenetic age residuals were derived from a pediatric-specific buccal epithelial clock. We hypothesized that maternal depressive symptoms, both sub-clinical and elevated (clinical level), would be associated with estimated biological age deceleration in offspring during early infancy. We analyzed data from 94 mother-child dyads using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and DNA methylation derived from offspring buccal cells collected at 3-5 weeks of age. There was a significant non-linear association between the EPDS score and epigenetic age residual (β = -0.017, 95% confidence interval: -0.03,-0.01, P = <0.01). The results indicated that infants of mothers with sub-clinical depressive symptoms had the lowest infant epigenetic age residuals while infants of mothers with no-to-low depressive symptoms had the highest and experienced biological age acceleration. Maternal depressive symptoms may influence the biological aging of offspring living in poverty.",

Objectives: In this nested analysis, we investigated both OPRM1 A118G genotype and promoter/immediate downstream blood DNAm sequencing data for associations with opioid effects and chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) in a surgical cohort. Methods: Prospectively recruited opioid naïve patients undergoing Nuss procedure or spinal fusion with rs1799971 genotypes (Illumina arrays), DNAm (next generation enzymatic methylation sequencing at Chr6:154,039,209-154,039,803) and outcomes—opioid analgesia (integrated opioid use 1 pain over postoperative days 0 and 1 normalized to surgery type), safety—respiratory depression (RD) in high opioid use groups, and CPSP (Numerical Rating Scale .3/10 2-12 months postsurgery)—were included. Linear and logistic regression were performed to test genetic and epigenetic associations, adjusted for sociodemographics, cell types, and analgesics. Results: In this cohort (N 5 112; 15.3 6 2.0 years, 50% female, 83% White, 55% had CPSP, 13% had RD), DNAm at Chr6: 154039216-154039217 was associated with CPSP (odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.57; P 5 0.03), Chr6: 154039661-154039662 with acute integrated pain (b 5 220.9, 95% CI, 240.70 to 21.10, P 5 0.04), Chr6:154039520-154039521 (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.09-2.03; P 5 0.01), and Chr6:154039571-154039572 (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08-2.01; P 5 0.02) with RD. Significant CpG sites were located in Repressed Polycomb chromatin states. Genotype was not associated with DNAm or outcomes. Conclusion: Our analyses support OPRM1 DNAm as predictors of acute and chronic pain/opioid outcomes in children after painful surgery. Study limitations included absent GG genotype, low sequencing coverage, and lack of correction for multiple testing.",

    "abstract": "(1) Introduction: Epigenetic changes have been proposed as a biologic link between in-utero exposure to maternal smoking and health outcomes. Therefore, we examined if in-utero exposure to maternal smoking was associated with infant DNA methylation (DNAm) of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpG sites) in the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A AVPR1a gene. The AVPR1a gene encodes a receptor that interacts with the arginine vasopressin hormone and may influence physiological stress regulation, blood pressure, and child development. (2) Methods: Fifty-two infants were included in this cohort study. Multivariable linear models were used to examine the effect of in-utero exposure to maternal smoking on the mean DNAm of CpG sites located at AVPR1a. (3) Results: After adjusting the model for substance use, infants with in-utero exposure to maternal smoking had a reduction in DNAm at AVPR1a CpG sites by -0.02 (95% CI -0.03, -0.01) at one month of age. In conclusion, in-utero exposure to tobacco smoke can lead to differential patterns of DNAm of AVPR1a among infants. Conclusions: Future studies are needed to identify how gene expression in response to early environmental exposures contributes to health outcomes.",

    "issued": "2023-12-13",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified TET1 as a potential key regulator of genes linked to asthma. TET1 has been shown to transcriptionally respond to house dust mite extract, an allergen known to directly cause allergic asthma development, and regulate the expression of genes involved in asthma. How TET1 regulates expression of these genes, however, is unknown. TET1 is a DNA demethylase; therefore, most prior research on TET1-based gene regulation has focused on how TET1 affects methylation. However, TET1 can also interact directly with transcription factors and histone modifiers to regulate gene expression. Understanding how TET1 regulates expression to contribute to allergic responses and asthma development thus requires a comprehensive approach. To this end, we measured mRNA expression, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications in control and TET1 knockdown human bronchial epithelial cells treated or untreated with house dust mite extract. RESULTS: Throughout our analyses, we detected strong similarities between the effects of TET1 knockdown alone and the effects of HDM treatment alone. One especially striking pattern was that both TET1 knockdown and HDM treatment generally led to decreased chromatin accessibility at largely the same genomic loci. Transcription factor enrichment analyses indicated that altered chromatin accessibility following the loss of TET1 may affect, or be affected by, CTCF and CEBP binding. TET1 loss also led to changes in DNA methylation, but these changes were generally in regions where accessibility was not changing. CONCLUSIONS: TET1 regulates gene expression through different mechanisms (DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility) in different parts of the genome in the airway epithelial cells, which mediates inflammatory responses to allergen. Collectively, our data suggest novel molecular mechanisms through which TET1 regulates critical pathways following allergen challenges and contributes to the development of asthma.",

Two experiments were conducted: (1) Turbidity and pressure data were collected along a broad shallow shelf on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe in the summer of 2019 and (2) turbidity and pressure observations were conducted while boats traveled at speeds between 8 kmh−1 (5 mph) and 40 kmh−1 over a water depth of ≈ 2.5 m.

    "abstract": "Numerical modeling of self-aerated flows is essential for understanding water systems and designing hydraulic structures. This work discusses and extends a theoretical/numerical model to represent air entrainment in self-aerated flows, which includes a criterion to define the occurrence of air entrainment, based on a balance between disturbing and stabilizing energies. The impact of the turbulence closure on the modeling of the onset of air entrainment and the distribution of bubble concentration is studied with particular emphasis. This work shows that uniform-density formulations of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes closures lead to severe overprediction of air entrainment due to unphysical transport of turbulent kinetic energy generated in the air phase to the water phase. In contrast, combining variable-density turbulence closures with the energy balance criterion enables accurate prediction of the regions where air is entrained for stepped spillways and plunging jets. The choice of turbulence closure significantly influences the proposed criterion, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate closure for an accurate description of the air entrainment process. Based on the conducted tests, the standard k − ϵ and buoyancy modified k − ϵ models better predict the onset of air entrainment and bubble distribution in stepped spillways, while the k − ω SST model proves to be more effective in capturing air entrainment at the impingement point in plunging jets. This study expands the capabilities of numerical models in predicting air entrainment and provides valuable insights into the effects and interrelations of the turbulence modeling, the air entrainment occurrence criteria, and the bubble transport equations.",

    "abstract": "Despite its widespread appearance, the scour of cohesive materials has received relatively less attention than the granular counterpart. In particular, the different modes of erosion of cohesive soils, its long-term temporal evolution, and the effect of the impinging angle and jet regime on scour features still represent open questions. To shed light on these aspects, a series of long-term experiments were conducted involving a circular jet impinging on a clay bed at angles of 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90°. Experimental evidence allowed us to provide unprecedented insights into the peculiar evolution of the scour process, as well as empirical formulas to estimate the main geometrical features of the scour hole. Scour evolution is distinguished between continuous or discontinuous. These two modes differ for scour evolution kinetics and scour profile similitude. Distinct erosion mechanisms are documented, including the formation of a peculiar ring scour shape. The transition between strongly and weakly deflected jet regimes is investigated and, for the first time, related to the soil friction angle. Overall, the analysis of physical evidence allowed us to reach the following main conclusions: (1) the inclination of the jet and the tailwater depth affect the scour process and its evolution and (2) the long-term scour behavior should not be disregarded to provide trustable predicting tools.",

    "issued": "2024-04",
    "abstract": "There is consensus that under-ice circulation presents multiple phases through the winter, and that different mechanisms dominate each period. In this work, measurements of temperature, water velocity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen from Lake Massawippi, Quebec, Canada, obtained during the ice-covered season in 2019, were used to characterize the time scales of different winter regimes and transitions among dominating circulation mechanisms. Lake circulation during this period began with a single-cell convection induced by sediment flux pulses in early winter. The single-cell convection decayed into a brief quiescent period. Radiatively driven convection then formed a convectively mixed layer in late winter. The defined mixed layer and temperature structure provided the necessary conditions for the formation of a potential rotational feature, which briefly formed immediately prior to ice break-up. Ice break-up led to complex hydrodynamics that persisted for nearly 28 days following full ice-off. Dissolved oxygen was directly correlated with the varying circulation features throughout the field campaign. This work provides a quantitative measure to delineate the transitions between under-ice regimes and provides novel insights into the subsequent circulation during and after ice break-up.",

    "issued": "2023-04",
    "abstract": "This work presents a novel theoretical/numerical model for the simulation of self-aerated flows under a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework. The new formulation is based on a three-phase mixture approach composed of a continuous air phase, a bubble phase, and a continuous water phase. A mass transfer mechanism that does not depend on an entrainment function and does not require calibration accounts for the incorporation of air into the flow. A modification in the formulation of the Volume-of-Fluid algorithm (used to track the free surface) allows one to capture the increase in water depth due to the presence of bubbles. The proposed formulation recovers the traditional Volume-of-Fluid formulation for free surface flows in the absence of bubbles, allowing the model to represent simultaneously the aerated and not aerated regions of a flow. Governing equations for the mixture are derived from mass and momentum conservation equations for each phase, and a numerical algorithm that ensures the boundedness of the numerical solution is proposed. The model is tested and validated using four experimental cases: a degassing tank, a bubble plume, a plunging jet, and a stepped spillway, showing very satisfactory results. The new methodology provides a significant advance in the current capabilities for simulating self-aerated flows.",

The Dark E-field Radio experiment is a wideband search for dark photon dark matter. In this paper we detail changes in calibration and upgrades since our proof-of-concept pilot run. Our detector employs a wide-bandwidth E-field antenna moved to multiple positions in a shielded room, a low noise amplifier, wideband analog-to-digital converter, followed by a 224-point fast Fourier transform. An optimal filter searches for signals with Q≈106. In nine days of integration, this system is capable of detecting dark photon signals corresponding to a kinetic mixing strength ϵ several orders of magnitude lower than previous limits. We find a 95% exclusion limit on ϵ over this mass range between 6×10-15 and 6×10-13, tracking the complex resonant mode structure in the shielded room.",

    "abstract": "We are building an experiment to search for dark matter in the form of dark photons in the nano- to milli-eV mass range. This experiment is the electromagnetic dual of magnetic detector dark radio experiments. It is also a frequency-time dual experiment in two ways: We search for a high-Q signal in wide-band data rather than tuning a high- resonator, and we measure electric rather than magnetic fields. In this paper we describe a pilot experiment using room temperature electronics which demonstrates feasibility and sets useful limits to the kinetic coupling over 50-300 MHz. With a factor of 2000 increase in real-time spectral coverage, and lower system noise temperature, it will soon be possible to search a wide range of masses at 100 times this sensitivity. We describe the planned experiment in two phases: Phase-I will implement a wide band, 5-million channel, real-time FFT processor over the 30-300 MHz range with a back-end time-domain optimal filter to search for the predicted line using low-noise amplifiers. We have completed spot frequency calibrations using a biconical dipole antenna in a shielded room that extrapolate to a limit of for the coupling from the dark field, per month of integration. Phase-II will extend the search to 20 GHz using cryogenic preamplifiers and new antennas.",

    "issued": "2025-05",
    "abstract": "Feed efficiency is critical in dairy farming, affecting production costs and environmental sustainability. The development of the trait residual feed intake (RFI) has provided an opportunity to select dairy cows that are more efficient in converting nutrients into milk. Note that RFI requires individual daily intake records, which are typically collected on a limited number of research farms. In this context, the identification of biomarkers that can be used to identify and select more feed-efficient cows is of great interest. As such, this study aimed to identify ruminal and serum biomarkers associated with RFI in mid-lactation Holstein cows. A selected subset of 24 out of 454 Holstein cows was used in this study. This subset was strategically selected to represent extremes of least feed-efficient (LFE; n = 12, RFI = 2.44) and most feed-efficient (MFE; n = 12, RFI = -2.69) cows with no difference in the 3 energy sinks, namely BW change, metabolic BW, and energy secreted in milk. Rumen fluid and serum samples were collected between 60 and 90 DIM. Rumen fluid samples were collected using an oro-esophageal tubing procedure. Serum samples were used to measure fatty acids using a 2-step assay. The fatty acid methyl ester was assessed using solid-phase extraction and quantified using the chromatographic peak area and internal standard-based calculations. Ruminal ammonia nitrogen was measured using a phenol-hypochlorite assay, and serum urea was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. Cows in the MFE group had higher ruminal ammonia nitrogen concentrations than cows in the LFE group. There were no differences in serum urea concentration between MFE and LFE cows. Serum fatty acid concentrations differed between groups, with myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), cis-heptadecenoic acid (cis-9-17:1), stearic acid (C18:0), and total SFA having greater concentrations in the MFE group than in the LFE group. The total PUFA concentration was lower in the MFE group than in the LFE group. A model incorporating C14:0, C16:0, palmitoleic acid (trans-9-C16:1), anteiso-heptadecanoic acid plus palmitoleic acid (C17:0+trans-13-C16:1), oleic acid (cis-9-C18:1), cis-vaccenic acid (cis-11-C18:1), petroselinic acid (cis-12-C18:1), C18:0, linoleic acid (C18:2n-6), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6), cis-MUFA, n-6 PUFA, total PUFA, total SFA, and other or unknown fatty acids was used to assess goodness-of-fit for RFI and showed an adjusted R2 of 0.74. When ruminal ammonia nitrogen was added to the previous model, the adjusted R2 improved to 0.84. Our findings provide evidence that ruminal ammonia nitrogen and serum fatty acids are associated with RFI, thus suggesting that these metabolites might be helpful in identifying more feed-efficient dairy cows.",

    "issued": "2025-01",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although body fatness is a recognized risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the underlying mechanisms of how fat composition affects pancreatic carcinogenesis are poorly understood. High-fat diets (HFDs) can disrupt intestinal barrier function, potentially accelerating carcinogenesis. Omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) have anti-inflammatory properties and help preserve intestinal integrity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate how ω-3 FAs affect the colonic barrier in the context of HFD-induced changes, in a mouse model of PDAC [p48-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D (KC)]. METHODS: Male and female KC mice were randomly assigned into 1 of the following 4 groups: 1) a control diet containing ∼11% total calories from fat with an ω-6:ω-3 FA ratio of 10:1 (C), 2) the control diet with high concentrations of ω-3 FA with an ω-6:ω-3 FA ratio of 1:1 (Cω3), 3) an HFD containing 60% total calories from fat with an ω-6:ω-3 FA ratio of approximately 10:1 (HF), and 4) an HFD with high concentrations of ω-3 FA with an ω-6:ω-3 FA ratio of 1:1 (HFω3). RESULTS: Consumption of an HFD for 8 wk caused: 1) disruption of tight junction structure and function; 2) decreased goblet cell number; 3) higher colonic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NADPH oxidase 1 expression; 4) activation of TLR4-triggered pathways, that is, NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; 5) elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide concentrations; and 6) higher pancreatic TLR4 expression, and 7) accelerated acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. All of these events were mitigated in mice fed the HFω3. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the concept that, in the context of obesity, ω-3 FAs have protective effects during early-stage pancreatic carcinogenesis through the regulation of intestinal permeability and endotoxemia.",

    "abstract": "Some microbes in the rumen form trans-10,cis-12 (t10,c12)-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a fatty acid that depresses synthesis of milk fat in dairy cattle and other lactating animals. Despite their importance to milk fat depression, the microbes responsible have been difficult to identify, and no laboratory strain is currently available for study. Here we describe the isolation of Cutibacterium acnes AP1, a bacterium that forms t10,c12-CLA at fast rates. It was isolated from rumen contents of a heifer by using medium containing lactate and metronidazole. It formed t10,c12-CLA from linoleic acid, a result confirmed by a combination of 3 methods (spectrophotometry, thin-layer chromatography, and GC). The initial rate of formation was 67% faster than for Cutibacterium acnes DSM 1897, the type strain from human skin. The availability of this isolate and its ability to rapidly form t10,c12-CLA make it a good subject for further study.

    "abstract": "Fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs) are mesenchymal stem cells that produce extracellular matrix (ECM) and intramuscular adipocytes in skeletal muscle. While FAPs have demonstrated responsiveness to their physical environment, there is limited knowledge of how the ECM substrate of FAPs impacts their differentiation, particularly in livestock animals. We hypothesized that the ECM substrate FAPs are cultured on will differentially impact their adherence, proliferation, and differentiation. Through an initial screen of 9 ECM proteins and their combinations, significant variation of bovine FAP attachment and differentiation across coatings was observed. The ECM substrates fibronectin, collagen 6, vitronectin, and a combination of fibronectin and collagen 6 were selected for further testing. Notably, fibronectin increased cell proliferation and attachment rates, without impairing FAP adipogenic or fibrogenic differentiation compared to the other coatings. Benefits of fibronectin were maintained at lower concentrations and when combined with less favorable coatings such as collagen 6. When assessed for their adipogenic potential on each coating at different substrate stiffnesses, lipid accumulation decreased with increasing substrate stiffness, while cell attachment increased on stiffer substrates. Overall, these results demonstrate the high responsiveness of FAPs to their ECM substrate, along with highlighting fibronectin as a preferred substrate for in vitro experiments with bovine FAPs.",

    "abstract": "Feeding high-grain diets is a common practice in intensive ruminant production systems to meet animal energy requirements and maximize feed efficiency. One of the consequences of these diets is trans (t)10 shifted ruminal biohydrogenation, which includes increased formation of t10-18:1 and t10, cis (c)12-conjugated linoleic acid (t10, c12-CLA) at the expense of t11-18:1 and c9, t11-CLA. In dairy cows, the t10 shift has been associated with milk fat depression. In beef cattle, the t10 shift has not been associated with negative effects on animal performance or marbling fat deposition; however, it may negatively impact meat fat eating quality by decreasing its cis monounsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid ratio. Finally, the t10 shift increases t10-18:1 accumulation in ruminant-derived foods (dairy, beef, and lamb), which at high enough levels may compromise the nutritional quality of these foods. The present review will cover our current understanding of the rumen microbes involved in the t10 shift and its implications for milk fat synthesis and beef fat quality.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Designing transonic laminar swept wing at high Reynolds numbers is challenging due to the premature flow transition from the prominent crossflow instabilities (CFIs). Hence, natural laminar flow (NLF) wings are limited to lower sweep angles. In this study, hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) is used to extend this limit to design low-drag transonic infinite wing. A multi-objective genetic algorithm with competing drag components as objectives is used to design NLF and HLFC airfoils. Optimal design is a tradeoff between the drag reduction from skin friction drag, pressure drag, and suction drag, and does not resemble initial airfoils. Airfoil shape and suction distribution are coupled and optimized simultaneously. Euler flow solver with integral boundary-layer method is coupled with a higher-fidelity Linear Stability Analysis using 2.5D approximation for transition prediction. At wing sweep of 22.5°, Mach number of 0.78, and Reynolds number of 30 million, optimum NLF airfoil has 27% lower drag than an optimum turbulent airfoil. The optimum HLFC airfoil showed a 25% lower total drag than the NLF airfoil. A higher optimum sweep angle was observed for low-drag HLFC airfoil (20.5°) in comparison to the NLF airfoil (16.8°) and both favored an undercut on the lower surface to dampen CFI. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study provides a validation of a recently developed uncertainty quantification methodology for suction velocities with the example of a novel laminar flow control design referred to as a tailored skin single duct (TSSD) panel. The TSSD panel is located on the leading edge of a vertical fin model of an Airbus A320 that is designed to maintain and extend laminar flow over the fin by means of boundary-layer suction. The suction velocities are highly dependent on the local porosity, which is only partly known in practice; therefore, the associated uncertainties need to be quantified. This is achieved by combining experimental and numerical data. The experimental data are based on the wind-tunnel experiments on a full-scale Airbus A320 vertical fin equipped with the TSSD system performed in the large low-speed facility of the German–Dutch Wind Tunnels. The measurements also feature highly accurate mass flow measurements of the integral mass flow through the TSSD system that serve as a validation reference for the uncertainty analysis. Uncertainties are provided for the predicted and the measured total mass flows to validate the proposed method, and a good agreement is obtained. A sensitivity study reveals the most influential contributions to the variance of the computed suction velocities. Depending on the difference between plenum and outer pressure, either uncertainties in the pressure distribution or uncertainties in the porosity parameters dominate the variance of the suction velocity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "While many theories assume that sleep is critical in stabilizing and strengthening memories, our recent behavioral study (Liu & Ranganath, 2021, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 28[6], 2035-2044) suggests that sleep does not simply stabilize memories. Instead, it plays a more complex role, integrating information across two temporally distinct learning episodes. In the current study, we simulated the results of Liu and Ranganath (2021) using our biologically plausible computational model, TEACH, developed based on the complementary learning systems (CLS) framework. Our model suggests that when memories are activated during sleep, the reduced influence of temporal context establishes connections across temporally separated events through mutual training between the hippocampus and neocortex. In addition to providing a compelling mechanistic explanation for the selective effect of sleep, this model offers new examples of the diverse ways in which the cortex and hippocampus can interact during learning.",

    "abstract": "Successful learning depends on various factors such as depth of processing, motivation, or curiosity about information. A strong drive to learn something or the expectation of receiving a reward can be crucial to enhance learning. However, the influence of curiosity on the processing of new information and its similarity with reward processing is not well understood. This study examined whether states of curiosity influence specific ERPs associated with reward processing and whether these ERPs are related with later memory benefits. In an initial screening phase, participants indicated their curiosity and confidence in prior knowledge about answers to various trivia questions. In a subsequent study phase, we targeted different time windows related to reward processing during the presentation of trivia answers containing the reward positivity (RewP; 250-350 msec), the P3 (250-500 msec), and the late-positive-potential (LPP; 600-1000 msec). In a following surprise memory test, we found that participants recalled more high- than low-curiosity answers. The RewP, P3, and LPP showed greater positive mean amplitudes for high compared with low curiosity, reflecting increased reward processing. In addition, we found that the RewP and the P3 showed more positive mean amplitudes for later recalled compared with later forgotten answers, but curiosity did not modulate this encoding-related results. These findings support the view that the satisfaction of curiosity resembles reward processing, indicated by ERPs.",

    "abstract": "According to most memory theories, encoding involves continuous communication between the hippocampus and neocortex, but recent work has shown that key moments at the end of an event, called event boundaries, may be especially critical for memory formation. We sought to determine how communication between the hippocampus and neocortical regions during the encoding of naturalistic events related to subsequent retrieval of those events and whether this was particularly important at event boundaries. Participants encoded and recalled two cartoon movies during fMRI scanning. Higher functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the posterior medial network (PMN) at an event's offset is related to the subsequent successful recall of that event. Furthermore, hippocampal-PMN offset connectivity also predicted the amount of detail retrieved after a 2-day delay. These data demonstrate that the relationship between memory encoding and hippocampal-neocortical interaction is dynamic and biased toward boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex physiological process fundamentally dependent on angiogenesis for effective tissue repair. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have shown significant potential in promoting angiogenesis, primarily through their secretome, rich in proteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs) essential for cell signaling and tissue regeneration. This study investigates the effect of a collagen-bound proteoglycan mimetic (LXW7-DS-SILY or LDS), that binds to the αvβ3 integrin receptor, on the EPC secretome, with a dual focus on the proteomic content and the functional properties of EVs. Utilizing high-resolution two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) alongside bioinformatic analysis, we identified significant alterations in protein expression profiles, particularly in angiogenesis and wound healing pathways. The functional impact of these changes was validated through biological assays, where the whole secretome and the EV fraction from EPCs seeded on collagen-bound LDS markedly enhanced vascular network formation, driven by the increase of growth factors and angiogenic regulators such as FGFR1, NRP1, and ANGPT2 within the EV fraction. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further highlighted the enrichment of proteins within the EVs driving biological processes, including 'response to wounding' and 'positive regulation of cell motility'. These results underscore that LDS modulates the EPC secretome and significantly enhances its angiogenic potential, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for non-healing and ischemic wounds and suggesting that biomaterials can be modified to control the EV secretome to enhance tissue repair. Functional assays validating the omics data highlight the robustness of LDS as a targeted therapeutic for enhancing angiogenesis and tissue repair in clinical settings. Moreover, the pivotal role of EVs in mediating pro-angiogenic effects offers insights into developing biomaterial therapies that exploit key regulators within the EPC secretome for wound healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript explores how a proteoglycan mimetic that binds to both collagen and the αvβ3 integrin receptor affects the proteome component of the secretome from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). It presents functional biological data, analytical data, and proteomic analysis of the soluble and extracellular vesical (EV) components of the secratome. The proteomic data maps to the observed enhanced angiogenic potential of the EVs. These results suggest that by controlling the cellular environment and judicially engineering how cells interact with a biomaterial can influence the proteomic composition of EVs to enhance tissue regeneration. This is the foundation of future work aimed at engineering biomaterial cell systems to influence the proteomic component of EVs for therapeutic use.",

Over recent years, SERS has experienced rapid development and became a critical tool in biomedicine with its unparalleled sensitivity and molecular specificity. This review summarizes the advancements and challenges in SERS substrates, nanotags, instrumentation, and spectral analysis for biomedical applications. We highlight the key developments in colloidal and solid SERS substrates, with an emphasis on surface chemistry, hotspot design, and 3D hydrogel plasmonic architectures. Additionally, we introduce recent innovations in SERS nanotags, including those with interior gaps, orthogonal Raman reporters, and near-infrared-II-responsive properties, along with biomimetic coatings. Emerging technologies such as optical tweezers, plasmonic nanopores, and wearable sensors have expanded SERS capabilities for single-cell and single-molecule analysis. Advances in spectral analysis, including signal digitalization, denoising, and deep learning algorithms, have improved the quantification of complex biological data. Finally, this review discusses SERS biomedical applications in nucleic acid detection, protein characterization, metabolite analysis, single-cell monitoring, and in vivo deep Raman spectroscopy, emphasizing its potential for liquid biopsy, metabolic phenotyping, and extracellular vesicle diagnostics. The review concludes with a perspective on clinical translation of SERS, addressing commercialization potentials and the challenges in deep tissue in vivo sensing and imaging.",

Multi-omics approaches, while promising, are high in cost and complexity, low throughput, slow, and require large sample volumes, thus are impractical for many stages of clinical care. Raman spectroscopy (RS) addresses many of these needs: it requires little to no sample preparation, is non-destructive, does not need exogenous dyes or labelling agents, and can be performed directly in aqueous solutions. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers further improvements in terms of sensitivity but increases complexity. In this study we carried out comprehensive RS and SERS measurements on a &amp;gt;100-person cohort of blood and saliva from head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and benign controls. Analyses were carried out on whole biofluids, in addition to extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from the biofluids to investigate the added value. EVs are emerging biomarkers of interest found in high numbers in circulating biofluids with great promise to increase the specificity of diagnostic platforms.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: We analyzed a robust clinical dataset of HNC patient saliva and plasma to build a diagnostic model. We found distinct Raman and SERS signatures of metabolites in all cancer samples uniquely present compared to non-cancer controls. Raman spectral measurements fused together for EVs and whole biofluids across saliva and plasma delivered accuracies of &amp;gt;95% using a novel machine learning module based on convolutional neural networks.

    "abstract": "Granular materials transition between unjammed (deformable) and jammed (rigid) states when adjusting their packing density. Here, we report on experiments demonstrating that the same kind of phase transition can be alternatively achieved through temperature-controlled particle shape change. Using a confined system of randomly-packed rod-like particles made of shape memory alloy (SMA), we exploit that shape recovery of these bent rods with rising temperature at a constant packing density leads to a jammed state. The responsible physical processes are elucidated with numerical simulations based on the Discrete Element Method. As an exemplary application of the uncovered mechanism, we engineer a smart clamp that can actively grip or release an object through the thermo-induced jamming or unjamming of the granular material, and robustly so under cyclic temperature changes. In the jammed state, its load-bearing capability surpasses the total SMA weight by a tunable margin, up to over 800-fold. The clamping design paves the way towards a new kind of functional devices based on the thermo-responsive jamming of shape memory granular materials.",

The reinforcement of the fiber structures to the granular bed is investigated under triaxial compression. The horizontal orthogonal elongated fibers, fiber cage, vertical and horizontal fiber nets were compared considering their strength reinforcement to granular bed. It is found that the structure of horizontal multi-fiber nets has the most significant improvement for the strength of granular bed, while the granular bed with vertical multi-fiber nets has the minimum strength. Under large axial strain, a linear regression relationship between the normalized deviatoric stress and the solid volume fraction of the horizontal fiber nets reinforced granular bed is observed. In addition, the strength of granular bed reinforced by horizontal fiber nets will increase and eventually reaches a peak with the increasing of fiber bond elastic modulus and friction coefficient of particles.",

    "abstract": "Discrete element method simulations are conducted to probe the various regimes of post-impact behavior of particles with solid surfaces. The impacting particles are described as spherical agglomerates consisting of smaller constituent (or primary) particles held together via surface adhesion. Under the influence of a wide range of impact velocities and particle surface energies, five distinct behavioral regimes-rebounding, vibration, fragmentation, pancaking, and shattering-are identified, and force transmission patterns are linked to post-impact behavior. In the rebounding regime, the coefficient of restitution decreases linearly as impact velocity increases and the particle agglomerate experiences compaction. In the fragmentation regime, rebound velocity generally decreases with increasing fragment size. The rebound velocity of fragments decreases with time except for the smallest fragments, which can increase in velocity due to collisions with other fragments of high velocity. Particle breakage in the pancaking regime does not follow common mechanistic models of breakage.",

Good agreement of the particle masses in the cup before and after penetration can be found in the simulations and experiments. The effects of particle length (Lp), friction coefficient, and particle configuration on the penetration depth of the impactor, ejecta mass, and solid volume fraction describing the response of the granular bed are discussed. The penetration depth is negatively correlated with Lp as the corresponding solid volume fraction of the granular bed decreases. A smaller friction coefficient leads to a larger penetration depth of the impactor and more ejection of particles. When the impactor is penetrating the Lp = 10 mm elongated particles, the penetration depth is negatively correlated to the order parameter and solid volume fraction.",

    "abstract": "Granular materials exhibit unique secondary flow behaviors upon shearing. We demonstrate, using particle dynamics simulations, that the secondary flow patterns are controlled by a pressure exerted on particle bed. A threshold pressure, at which vortex flow transitions to disturbed or chaotic flow, depends on particle shape, that influences interparticle contacts and rheological performance. Our results show that the flow patterns are essentially determined by a dimensionless term combining pressure and granular temperature for all the spherical and Platonic solid-shaped particles explored. Particle mixing is promoted by the vortex flow or disturbed flow with strong diffusion. The highest mixing rate under a specified pressure is obtained for cubic particles, due to the significant microstructural ordering near the boundaries causing a high gradient of packing density. These findings shed light on how applied pressure and particle shape affect secondary flows which is critical to the understanding and control of granular mixing.",

This instrument utilizes a commercial microscope and our previously reported multimodal SLO-OCT acquisition engine, allowing simultaneous detection of backscattered light from the SCLM illumination beam, fluorescent emission, and depth information about different retinal layers using OCM. Identical data formats of in vivo and ex vivo measurements facilitate better data analysis from the same animals. This allows better structural and potentially temporal co-registration when studying functional retinal responses. The improved spatial resolution of the SCLM/OCM system helps interpret in vivo results. The interchangeable objectives of the microscope allow control of the spatial resolution, while our custom data acquisition software controls the size of the field of view. In this presentation, we will review the design details of the combined SCLM/OCM system, showcase its performance, and compare retinal morphology acquired in vivo and ex vivo from the retina of the same animal.",

To improve this process, a new multimodal imaging system has been developed that combines swept-source optical coherence microscopy with confocal fluorescence microscopy. This system allows for the in vivo characterization and quantification of the biochemical composition of the ocular surface. In this proof-of-concept study, mouse models of evaporative dry eye disease (EDED) were tested using a fluorescently labeled ligand, specifically fluorescently labeled jacalin, which is a galactose-binding protein. The ligand was applied to the ocular surface, and after the animals were euthanized, the corneas were extracted, mounted, and imaged using a custom-built multimodal imaging system. This process accurately identified the binding sites of jacalin, demonstrating the system's potential to enhance the diagnosis and evaluation of therapies for evaporative EDED.",

    "abstract": "While the a-wave of mouse electroretinogram (ERG) occurs within 50 milliseconds after exposure to light, the optoretinogram (ORG) slower than a 20Hz sampling rate could face limitations in observing immediate morphological changes from the retina. In this study, we develop a compact custom-built mouse ORG system based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) for 100Hz~1KHz B-scan rates comprised of 100 kHz A-scans. All the optics of the developed ORG system are designed on a 24 x 24 inches optical breadboard to move easily as well as to combine with the ERG system in a dark room. Without using a fundus camera, the OCT system provides en-face images from high-pass filtering and square of the OCT spectral signal for mouse retinal positioning in-vivo before acquiring ORG data. The 490nm LED for light stimulus is generated to make uniform illumination at the mouse retina using the Maxwellian view method. The common path of the OCT scanning light and the visible LED is built with achromatic doublet lens combinations based on optical simulation with Opticstudio® . The developed compact ORG system can not only observe light-evoked responses with 1~10 milliseconds but also be used for the studies of correlations between ORG and ERG in the mouse retina.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) crowding and hallway care has been a serious problem for the past three decades in the United States and abroad. Myriad articles highlighting this problem and proposing solutions have had little impact on its progression. OBJECTIVES: To discuss reasons for ED crowding leading to hallway care, the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, potential solutions, and why little has changed despite widespread awareness. DISCUSSION: ED crowding has been a public health issue for the past three decades, leading to patient care and boarding of admitted patients in ED hallways with limited resources. This care is often substandard and precarious. The COVID-19 pandemic placed further strain on the ED safety net, especially in certain urban areas. Despite recognition of the problem, publication of studies, and proposals offering many solutions, this problem continues to worsen. Corporate and hospital leadership must be made aware of the financial and legal ramifications for failure to address potential solutions, such as inpatient hallway boarding, provision of flexible expansion care areas, smoothing of elective admissions/surgeries, and efficient inpatient discharge flow. State and federal legislation may also be required to motivate this process. CONCLUSIONS: ED crowding and hallway care will continue to worsen unless hospital leadership is willing to listen to ED staff concerns and address the problem on all levels of the hospital using previously proposed solutions. Emergency physicians should not fear termination for discussing this issue and its potential for poor clinical outcomes and ED staff morale.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is an uncommon but unique disorder defined by recurrent abdominal pain, intractable nausea, and emesis in patients who regularly smoke cannabis. The syndrome does not reliably respond to intravenous administration of the usual antiemetics but improves with hot showers and baths (hydrothermotherapy). Complete resolution of CHS occurs only after cessation of cannabis use. AREA COVERED: The authors review the clinical features of CHS, the differences between CHS and cyclic vomiting syndrome, putative etiology, incidence, and different treatment options with analgesics, antiemetics, antipsychotics, beta blockers, and transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) agonists, hydrothermotherapy and capsaicin. EXPERT OPINION: CHS is frequently unrecognized by clinicians, leading to extensive and unnecessary testing and treatment. Directed questions about cannabis use and the effect of hydrothermotherapy on CHS symptoms frequently confirm the diagnosis, enabling appropriate pharmacotherapy and referral to addiction treatment. CHS prevalence will continue to rise in parallel with increasing worldwide cannabis use and potency. Classic antiemetics may be tried initially but often fail to alleviate CHS. Antipsychotics (such as haloperidol), benzodiazepines, and/or capsaicin cream appear to be the most efficacious in the treatment of this unique disorder.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Evaluate the impact of a new program of SBIRT by a dedicated certified alcohol and drug abuse counselor (CADC) for emergency department (ED) patients. Methods: A year-long prospective, longitudinal study of patients identified by their treating clinician and referred to the CADC, who conducted SBIRT, motivational interviewing, and outpatient referral. Demographics, encounter details, and additional ED visits were recorded. Results: There were 294 patients, 39% with psychiatric concerns, 34% with alcohol/drug-related issues, or 27% with medical illness/injury. The most common substance use disorders were alcohol (40%) and methamphetamine (27%). For patients with high rate of recidivism, the average number of visits 6 months pre- and post-intervention decreased 67%. Homeless patients accounted for 45% and were more likely to be placed into a recovery program than domiciled patients (OR = 2.34). Despite screening positive, 45% of total patients were not given a discharge diagnosis related to substance use disorder by their treating clinician. Conclusion: A new program of SBIRT by a dedicated CADC had a positive impact, providing a much-needed service that did not previously exist. This type of program has potential to decrease ED utilization, crowding, and length of stay for patients with substance use disorders.",

However, this methodology is limited to organisms possessing well-characterized species-specific reagents (e.g., antibodies) that allow cell identification, clustering, and convolutional neural network (CNN) training. In the absence of such reagents, the power of image-based classification has remained mostly off-limits to many research organisms. We have developed an image-based classification methodology we named Image3C (Image-Cytometry Cell Classification) that does not require species-specific reagents nor pre-existing knowledge about the sample. Image3C combines image-based flow cytometry with an unbiased, high-throughput cell clustering pipeline and CNN integration. Image3C exploits intrinsic cellular features and non-species-specific dyes to perform de novo cell composition analysis and detect changes between different conditions. Therefore, Image3C expands the use of image-based analyses of cell population composition to research organisms in which detailed cellular phenotypes are unknown or for which species-specific reagents are not available.",

They are an emerging model for evolutionary studies due to the high diversity, ancient history, and wide geographical distribution. Insight into drivers of ampullariid evolution is hampered, however, by the lack of genomic resources. Here, we report the genomes of four ampullariids spanning the Old World (Lanistes nyassanus) and New World (Pomacea canaliculata, P. maculata, and Marisa cornuarietis) clades. The ampullariid genomes have conserved ancient bilaterial karyotype features and a novel Hox gene cluster rearrangement, making them valuable in comparative genomic studies. They have expanded gene families related to environmental sensing and cellulose digestion, which may have facilitated some ampullarids to become notorious invasive pests. In the amphibious Pomacea, novel acquisition of an egg neurotoxin and a protein for making the calcareous eggshell may have been key adaptations enabling their transition from underwater to terrestrial egg deposition.",

    "abstract": "Pomacea canaliculata is a freshwater snail with interesting biological features that include invasiveness, human parasite hosting, and adult regeneration. Its immune system may represent the target for strategies aimed at controlling the spread of the snail population and its hosting of the human parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Moreover, immune functions likely have a role in the snail's ability to wound heal and regenerate. Despite its importance in multiple processes, very little is known about the molecular basis of P. canaliculata immunity. Aiming to contribute to filling this gap, the ultrastructure of circulating hemocytes in healthy snails is studied and the first proteomic analysis of these cells is performed, evidencing 83 unique proteins, 96% of which have identifiable homologs in other species. Fifteen proteins are retrieved as potentially involved in immune-related signaling pathways, such as hemocyanin, C1q-like protein, and HSP90 together with cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-related proteins involved in cell motility and membrane dynamics. This first proteome study on non-stimulated hemocytes provides a valid reference for future investigations on the molecular changes under stressful circumstances, like pathogen exposure, wounding, or environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ability to efficiently visualize and manipulate chromosomes is fundamental to understanding the genome architecture of organisms. Conventional chromosome preparation protocols developed for mammalian cells and those relying on species-specific conditions are not suitable for many invertebrates. Hence, a simple and inexpensive chromosome preparation protocol, adaptable to multiple invertebrate species, is needed. RESULTS: We optimized a chromosome preparation protocol and applied it to several planarian species (phylum Platyhelminthes), the freshwater apple snail Pomacea canaliculata (phylum Mollusca), and the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (phylum Cnidaria). We demonstrated that both mitotically active adult tissues and embryos can be used as sources of metaphase chromosomes, expanding the potential use of this technique to invertebrates lacking cell lines and/or with limited access to the complete life cycle. Simple hypotonic treatment with deionized water was sufficient for karyotyping; growing cells in culture was not necessary. The obtained karyotypes allowed the identification of differences in ploidy and chromosome architecture among otherwise morphologically indistinguishable organisms, as in the case of a mixed population of planarians collected in the wild. Furthermore, we showed that in all tested organisms representing three different phyla this protocol could be effectively coupled with downstream applications, such as chromosome fluorescent in situ hybridization. CONCLUSIONS: Our simple and inexpensive chromosome preparation protocol can be readily adapted to new invertebrate research organisms to accelerate the discovery of novel genomic patterns across the branches of the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Positive psychological characteristics may help to bolster daily functioning in older adults even in the presence of subjective or subtle objective cognitive weaknesses. The purpose of the present study was to examine which specific psychological characteristics may contribute to better functional abilities, independent of cognitive performance, among a sample of older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 277 older adults recruited from the community who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial examining the impact of training in memory support strategies and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The current study was based on baseline data prior to intervention randomization. MEASUREMENTS: Linear regression was used to assess associations between positive psychological characteristics (positive affect, life satisfaction, purpose in life, resiliency, self-management of health, and perceived competence), one negative psychological characteristic (negative affect), and functional abilities controlling for demographic variables. A final model assessed for associations between functional abilities and any of the significant characteristics identified in the linear regressions while controlling for global cognition (measured with the Modified Neuropsychological Test Battery composite score), depression, and demographic variables. RESULTS: In the individual regressions, most of the psychological characteristics were significantly associated with functional abilities. In the final model, positive and negative affect remained significantly associated with functional abilities. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to show that greater positive affect is associated with better functional abilities, even after controlling for objective cognitive performance. Positive affect in older adults may represent a modifiable target for intervention.",

This challenge is further exacerbated by the sparsity of data needed for modeling. Deep learning methods offer a novel method to help address these challenging multiclass classification and prediction problems. METHODS: We analyzed 3 target feature-sets from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset: (1) neuropsychological (cognitive) data; (2) patient health history data; and (3) the combination of both sets. We used a masked Transformer-encoder without further feature selection to classify the samples on cognitive status (no cognitive impairment, aMCI, AD)-dynamically ignoring unavailable features. We then fine-tuned the model to predict the participants' future diagnosis in 1 to 3 years. We analyzed the sensitivity of the model to input features via Feature Permutation Importance. RESULTS: We demonstrated (1) the masked Transformer-encoder was able to perform prediction with sparse input data; (2) high multiclass current cognitive status classification accuracy (87% control, 79% aMCI, 89% AD); (3) acceptable results for 1- to 3-year multiclass future cognitive status prediction (83% control, 77% aMCI, 91% AD).

KAP leverages kinetic-augmented pill bottles that have unique IDs embedded into their acoustic signatures for vibrations generated when they are put down. This enhanced pill bottle can be seamlessly integrated with existing vibration-based in-home occupant monitoring systems to detect and recognize medication interactions. Compared to prior work on medication non-adherence monitoring, such as using specially designed pill bottles, pill dispensers, or scanners, our system is battery-free and non-intrusive, while preserving the original usage of the standardized pill bottles from pharmacies. We design and implement KAP with a 3D-printed kinetic-augmentation attachment and a kinetic model-guided feature extraction and recognition algorithm. We conduct real-world data collection and depict preliminary results to demonstrate the feasibility of KAP.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor response to systemic therapies, including immunotherapy. Given the immunotherapeutic potential of natural killer (NK) cells, we evaluated intratumoral NK cell infiltrates along with cytotoxic T cells in PDAC to determine their association with patient outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed tumors from 93 PDAC patients treated from 2012 to 2020. Predictor variables included tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), T-cell markers (CD3, CD8, CD45RO), NK marker (NKp46), and NK inhibitory marker (major histocompatibility complex class I [MHC-I]) by immunohistochemistry. Primary outcome variables were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Mean TILs, CD3, and NKp46 scores were 1.3 ± 0.63, 20.6 ± 17.5, and 3.1 ± 3.9, respectively. Higher expression of CD3 and CD8 was associated with higher OS, whereas NK cell infiltration was not associated with either RFS or OS. There was a tight positive correlation between MHC-I expression and all T-cell markers, but not with NKp46. CONCLUSIONS: Overall NK cell infiltrates were low in PDAC and did not predict clinical outcomes, whereas T-cell infiltrates did. Further characterization of the immune infiltrate in PDAC, including inhibitory signals and suppressive cell types, may yield better biomarkers of prognosis and immune targeting in this refractory disease.",

However, the reported prevalence of amyloid on biopsies taken during trigger release surgery has varied widely, and no biopsy-positive patients in prior studies have been diagnosed with occult cardiac amyloidosis or started on disease-modifying therapy. We review the existing literature on this topic and present a case of a patient with cardiac amyloidosis diagnosed from a biopsy taken during trigger release surgery and subsequently started on disease-modifying therapy.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: High-grade complex karyotype sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors with a uniformly poor prognosis. Within complex karyotype sarcomas, there are innumerable genetic changes but identifying those that are clinically relevant has been challenging. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To address this, we utilized a pooled genetic screening approach, informed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, to identify key drivers and modifiers of sarcoma development that were validated in vivo. RESULTS: YAP1 and wild-type KRAS were validated as drivers and transformed human mesenchymal stem cells into two distinct sarcoma subtypes, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and myxofibrosarcoma, respectively. A subset of tumors driven by CDK4 and PIK3CA reflected leiomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma demonstrating the plasticity of this approach and the potential to investigate sarcoma subtype heterogeneity. All generated tumors histologically reflected human sarcomas and had increased aneuploidy as compared to simple karyotype sarcomas. Comparing differential gene expression of TCGA samples to model data identified increased oxidative phosphorylation signaling in YAP1 tumors. Treatment of a panel of soft tissue sarcomas with a combination of YAP1 and oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors led to significantly decreased viability. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional co-analysis of TCGA patient samples to YAP1 and KRAS model tumors supports that these sarcoma subtypes lie along a spectrum of disease and adds guidance for further transcriptome-based refinement of sarcoma subtyping. This approach can be used to begin to understand pathways and mechanisms driving human sarcoma development, the relationship between sarcoma subtypes, and to identify and validate new therapeutic vulnerabilities for this aggressive and heterogeneous disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Intraoperative peripheral margin sampling in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a routine practice among musculoskeletal oncologists. Practice patterns are variable, and evidence to support it is lacking. Rates of peripheral margin sampling at our institution were analyzed in addition to its clinical utility and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Peripheral margin sampling patterns at a tertiary sarcoma center were retrospectively evaluated. Concordance between peripheral margins and final pathology was assessed using McNemar's test and κ Coefficient. Clinical outcomes were compared, and a cost-utility analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 179 patients were included. 66% had peripheral margins sampled of which 23% had frozen margins analyzed. Ten patients had positive margins (5.5% of all patients; 8.4% in those with margins sampled) and R1 margins on the final tumor specimen were identified in 15 patients (8.4%). There were no R2 resections. Three patients underwent repeat surgical resection (20%). Three patients with R1 resections had negative peripheral margins sampled, suggesting falsely reassuring peripheral margins. Peripheral margin sampling averaged $5000/patient. CONCLUSIONS: Routine peripheral margin sampling in STS resection is of questionable utility with added cost. Prospective studies are warranted to determine the optimal approach to surgical margin assessment.",

    "issued": "2025-01-01",
    "abstract": "The double-blinded randomized trial is considered the gold standard to estimate the average causal effect (ACE). The naive estimator without adjusting any covariate is consistent. However, incorporating the covariates that are strong predictors of the outcome could reduce the issue of unbalanced covariate distribution between the treated and controlled groups and can improve efficiency. Recent work has shown that thanks to randomization, for linear regression, an estimator under risk consistency (e.g. Random Forest) for the regression coefficients could maintain the convergence rate even when a nonparametric model is assumed for the effect of covariates. Also, such an adjusted estimator will always lead to efficiency gain compared to the naive unadjusted estimator. In this paper, we extend this result to the competing risk data setting and show that under similar assumptions, the augmented inverse probability censoring weighting (AIPCW) based adjusted estimator has the same convergence rate and efficiency gain. Extensive simulations were performed to show the efficiency gain in the finite sample setting. To illustrate our proposed method, we apply it to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) dietary modification trial studying the effect of a low-fat diet on cardiovascular disease (CVD) related mortality among those who have prior CVD.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: There is a consistent relationship with greater ovulation frequency and increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, prior research on infertility, which may be associated with ovulation frequency through multiple mechanisms, and ovarian cancer has yielded conflicting results, possibly due to prior research conflating fertility treatment with infertility and restricting follow-up to premenopausal cases. Our objective was to determine the association between infertility and risk of postmenopausal ovarian cancer, overall and by histotype, in a population that had not received treatment with IVF. METHODS: We utilized data from the Women's Health Initiative (n = 112,925 postmenopausal participants) with over 25 years of follow-up. At baseline, participants were asked whether they had ever tried to become pregnant for more than one year without becoming pregnant and whether a reason was found. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of incident adjudicated ovarian cancer comparing participants with a history of infertility to fertile participants overall and by histotype. RESULTS: 17% of participants reported a history of infertility at baseline and 1,109 ovarian cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up. No statistically significant association was observed between infertility and risk of any ovarian cancer (HR: 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.29), but those reporting infertility had a 90% higher risk of endometrioid and clear cell ovarian cancers (HR: 1.90 95% CI 1.09-3.34) compared to fertile participants. The reported reason(s) for infertility had no discernable impact on these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Infertility may be associated with clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancer but not other ovarian tumor histotypes.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although dysregulated inflammation has been postulated as a biological mechanism associated with post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) and shown to be a correlate and an outcome of PASC, it is unclear whether inflammatory markers can prospectively predict PASC risk. We examined the association of leukocyte count and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations, measured ~25 years prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with PASC, PASC severity, and PASC-associated cognitive outcomes at follow-up among postmenopausal women. METHODS: Using biomarker data from blood specimens collected during pre-pandemic enrollment (1993-1998) and data on 1,237 Women's Health Initiative participants who completed a COVID-19 survey between June 2021 and February 2022, we constructed multivariable regression models that controlled for pertinent characteristics. PASC status was defined according to established World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: Controlling for baseline characteristics, log e -transformed leukocyte count (β = 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.47, P = 0.009) and leukocyte count ≥5.5 × 1,000 cells/µL (β = 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.23; P = 0.02) were positively associated with PASC severity, defined as the sum of PASC symptoms, but not associated with overall PASC occurrence or PASC-related cognitive outcomes. Concentration of hsCRP, available on only ~27% of participants, was not associated with any of the PASC outcomes, controlling for the same covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte count, a widely available clinical marker of systemic inflammation, is an independent predictor of PASC severity in postmenopausal women. Heightened inflammation preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to PASC development. Limited statistical power to assess hsCRP role warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Allostatic load can reflect the body's response to chronic stress. However, little is known about the association between allostatic load and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. This study used a large prospective cohort in the United States to examine the relationship between allostatic load and invasive breast cancer risk, and to evaluate the relationship by racial and ethnic identity and breast cancer subtypes. METHODS: Among 161,808 postmenopausal participants in Women's Health Initiative, eligible were a subsample of 27,393 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years old, who enrolled from 1993 to 1998, had serum test biomarkers, and were followed for breast cancer incidence through February 2022. Allostatic load at enrollment was computed based on eight biomarkers from lab serum tests and a questionnaire about participants' prescription drug use. The associations between allostatic scores and risk of breast cancer (overall and by subtypes) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. The race and ethnic differences were examined. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up time of 17.24 years, 1722 invasive breast cancer cases were identified. High allostatic load was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (HR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.20, 1.54 for third tertile vs first tertile, Ptrend < 0.0001). Similar trends were found in White women and non-Hispanic women. Higher allostatic load was associated with hormone receptor-positive and HER2/Neu-negative breast cancer (HR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.30, 1.80 for third tertile vs first tertile, Ptrend < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that higher allostatic load was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women who reach menarche and menopause at earlier ages have been shown to be at increased risk for numerous conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression, and obesity; however, risk factors for earlier ages of menarche and menopause are not fully understood. Therefore, we aimed to perform a retrospective investigation of the associations between a personal birthweight and/or being born preterm and the age of and menarche and menopause and related events in the Women's Health Initiative, a large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal women. METHODS: At study entry, women reported their birthweight by category (< 6 lbs., 6-7 lbs. 15 oz, 8-9 lbs. 15 oz, or ≥ 10 lbs.) and preterm birth status (4 or more weeks premature). Ages at events related to menarche and menopause were also self-reported. Linear regression and logistic regression models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates (β) and odds ratios (OR), respectively (n ≤ 86,857). Individuals born preterm were excluded from all birthweight analyses. RESULTS: After adjustments, individuals born weighing < 6lbs. were more likely to reach natural menopause at an earlier age (adjusted β=-0.361, SE = 0.09, P = < 0.001) and have a shorter reproductive window (adjusted β = -0.287, SE = 0.10, p < 0.004) compared to individuals weighing 6-7 lbs. 15 oz. Individuals born preterm were also more likely to reach natural menopause at an earlier age (adjusted β=-0.506, SE = 0.16, P = 0.001) and have a shorter reproductive window (adjusted β = -0.418, SE = 0.17, p < 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise concerns that, as more preterm and low birthweight individuals survive to adulthood, the prevalence of earlier-onset menarche and menopause may increase. Clinical counseling and interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of preterm and low birthweight births, as well as intensification of lifestyle modifications to reduce CVD risk among women with these early-life risk factors, should be prioritized.",

    "abstract": "The polymerization of myosin molecules into thick filaments in muscle sarcomeres is essential for cardiac contractility, with the attenuation of interactions between the heads of myosin molecules within the filaments being proposed to result in hypercontractility, as observed in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, experimental evidence demonstrates that the structure of these giant macromolecular complexes is highly dynamic, with molecules exchanging between the filaments and a pool of soluble molecules on the minute timescale. Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that the enhancement of interactions between the heads of myosin molecules within thick filaments limits the mobility of myosin by taking advantage of mavacamten, a small molecule approved for the treatment of HCM. Myosin molecules were labeled in vivo with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and imaged in intact hearts using multiphoton microscopy. Treatment of the intact hearts with mavacamten resulted in an unexpected > 5-fold enhancement in GFP-myosin mobility within the sarcomere. In vitro biochemical assays suggested that mavacamten enhanced the mobility of GFP-myosin by increasing the solubility of myosin molecules, through the stabilization of a compact/folded conformation of the molecules, once disassociated from the thick filaments. These findings provide alternative insight into the mechanisms by which molecules exchange into and out of thick filaments and have implications for how mavacamten may affect cardiac contractility.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that oligodendrocyte-associated Nogo-A protein is an important regulator of axonal outgrowth and an important inhibitor of functional recovery and anatomical plasticity after central nervous system (CNS) injury. Abundant studies of oligodendrocyte-associated Nogo-A function in the uninjured rodent have suggested a role in neuronal development and synaptic function. On the other hand, the roles of neuron-associated (i.e., neuronal) Nogo-A have not been fully investigated. We have previously shown that neuronal Nogo-A influence dendritic spine density and morphology in pyramidal neurons of the intact neocortex. To further examine the role of neuronal Nogo-A in this synaptic population, we designed an RNAi directed against Nogo-A, delivered to the developing rat sensorimotor cortex using a neurotropic viral vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) 2/8. We examined the transduced neocortex for molecules important for synaptic plasticity, including N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits GRIN2A; glutamate receptor subunit epsilon-1 (NR2A), and GRIN2B; glutamate receptor subunit epsilon-2 (NR2B), as well as postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95). Furthermore, we also determined the density of excitatory synapses by examining the presynaptic protein vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGLut1) as a marker for potential excitatory synapses. Our results showed that neuronal Nogo-A knockdown in postnatal pyramidal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex led to a significant decrease in NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B messenger RNA when examined as adults. However, there was no difference in PSD-95 expression in comparison to controls. In addition, the decrease in the number of vGlut1(+) puncta on branches of apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons indicated the loss of synapses that have a strong influence on direct current entering the dendrite. Taken together, these results indicate that neuronal Nogo-A may regulate synaptic plasticity by modulating the components of excitatory synapses. This finding represents a novel role in excitatory synaptic formation for neuronal Nogo-A in developing neurons of the uninjured CNS.",

    "abstract": "β-adrenergic (β-AR) signaling is essential for the adaptation of the heart to exercise and stress. Chronic stress leads to the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase D (PKD). Unlike CaMKII, the effects of PKD on excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) remain unclear. To elucidate the mechanisms of PKD-dependent ECC regulation, we used hearts from cardiac-specific PKD1 knockout (PKD1 cKO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. We measured calcium transients (CaT), Ca2+ sparks, contraction and L-type Ca2+ current in paced cardiomyocytes under acute β-AR stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO; 100 nM). Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load was assessed by rapid caffeine (10 mM) induced Ca2+ release. Expression and phosphorylation of ECC proteins phospholambam (PLB), troponin I (TnI), ryanodine receptor (RyR), sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) were evaluated by western blotting. At baseline, CaT amplitude and decay tau, Ca2+ spark frequency, SR Ca2+ load, L-type Ca2+ current, contractility, and expression and phosphorylation of ECC protein were all similar in PKD1 cKO vs. WT. However, PKD1 cKO cardiomyocytes presented a diminished ISO response vs. WT with less increase in CaT amplitude, slower [Ca2+]i decline, lower Ca2+ spark rate and lower RyR phosphorylation, but with similar SR Ca2+ load, L-type Ca2+ current, contraction and phosphorylation of PLB and TnI. We infer that the presence of PKD1 allows full cardiomyocyte β-adrenergic responsiveness by allowing optimal enhancement in SR Ca2+ uptake and RyR sensitivity, but not altering L-type Ca2+ current, TnI phosphorylation or contractile response. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which PKD1 is regulating RyR sensitivity. We conclude that the presence of basal PKD1 activity in cardiac ventricular myocytes contributes to normal β-adrenergic responses in Ca2+ handling.",

    "abstract": "In this perspective, we discuss new evidence relating to current dietary recommendations to reduce SFA intake to modulate an individual's global risk of CVD. Although it is well established that lowering dietary SFA intake has a beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol concentrations, findings increasingly indicate an opposite effect on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. In recent years, many studies have firmly established a role for an elevated Lp(a) concentration as a genetically regulated, causal, and prevalent risk factor for CVD. However, there is less awareness of the effect of dietary SFA intake on Lp(a) concentrations. This study discusses this issue and highlights the contrasting effect of reducing dietary SFA intake on LDL cholesterol and Lp(a), 2 highly atherogenic lipoproteins. This calls attention to the need for precision nutrition approaches that move beyond a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. To illustrate the contrast, we describe the dynamic contributions of Lp(a) and LDL cholesterol concentrations to CVD risk during interventions with a low-SFA diet, with the hope that this will stimulate further studies and discussions regarding dietary management of CVD risk.",

    "abstract": "Reducing dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) intake results in a clinically significant lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) across ethnicities. In contrast, dietary SFA's role in modulating emerging cardiovascular risk factors in different ethnicities remains poorly understood. Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an independent cardiovascular risk factor, disproportionally affect individuals of African descent. Here, we assessed the responses in Lp(a) levels to dietary SFA reduction in 166 African Americans enrolled in GET-READI (The Gene-Environment Trial on Response in African Americans to Dietary Intervention), a randomized controlled feeding trial. Participants were fed two diets in random order for 5 weeks each: 1) an average American diet (AAD) (37% total fat: 16% SFA), and 2) a diet similar to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (25% total fat: 6% SFA). The participants' mean age was 35 years, 70% were women, the mean BMI was 28 kg/m2, and the mean LDL-C was 116 mg/dl. Compared to the AAD diet, LDL-C was reduced by the DASH-type diet (mean change: -12 mg/dl) as were total cholesterol (-16 mg/dl), HDL-C (-5 mg/dl), apoA-1 (-9 mg/dl) and apoB-100 (-5 mg/dl) (all P < 0.0001). In contrast, Lp(a) levels increased following the DASH-type diet compared with AAD (median: 58 vs. 44 mg/dl, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, in a large cohort of African Americans, reductions in SFA intake significantly increased Lp(a) levels while reducing LDL-C. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the SFA reduction-induced increase in Lp(a) levels and its role in cardiovascular risk across populations.",

By applying modern approaches, it was recently revealed that the genome is aneuploid. Interestingly, gene expression levels do not correlate with ploidy, potentially highlighting the importance of RNAi in gene regulation. Characterization of the RNAi pathway has led to potent tools for targeted gene knockdown, and the advent of RNAi-based forward genetics. CRISPR/Cas tools for editing the endogenous genome are an exciting possibility on the horizon. We celebrate the gains that have made E. histolytica tractable and anticipate continued advances.",

    "abstract": "Entamoeba histolytica is the cause of amoebiasis. The trophozoite (amoeba) form of this parasite is capable of invading the intestine and can disseminate through the bloodstream to other organs. The mechanisms that allow amoebae to evade complement deposition during dissemination have not been well characterized. We previously discovered a novel complement-evasion mechanism employed by E. histolytica. E. histolytica ingests small bites of living human cells in a process termed trogocytosis. We demonstrated that amoebae were protected from lysis by human serum following trogocytosis of human cells and that amoebae acquired and displayed human membrane proteins from the cells they ingested. Here, we aimed to define how amoebae are protected from complement lysis after performing trogocytosis. We found that amoebae were protected from complement lysis after ingestion of both human Jurkat T cells and red blood cells and that the level of protection correlated with the amount of material ingested. Trogocytosis of human cells led to a reduction in deposition of C3b on the surface of amoebae. We asked whether display of human complement regulators is involved in amoebic protection, and found that CD59 was displayed by amoebae after trogocytosis. Deletion of a single complement-regulatory protein, CD59 or CD46, from Jurkat cells was not sufficient to alter amoebic protection from lysis, suggesting that multiple, redundant complement regulators mediate amoebic protection. However, exogeneous expression of CD46 or CD55 in amoebae was sufficient to confer protection from lysis. These studies shed light on a novel strategy for immune evasion by a pathogen. IMPORTANCE Entamoeba histolytica is the cause of amoebiasis, a diarrheal disease of global importance. While infection is often asymptomatic, the trophozoite (amoeba) form of this parasite is capable of invading and ulcerating the intestine and can disseminate through the bloodstream to other organs. Understanding how E. histolytica evades the complement system during dissemination is of great interest. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that amoebae that have performed trogocytosis (nibbling of human cells) resist deposition of the complement protein C3b. Amoebae that have performed trogocytosis display the complement-regulatory protein CD59. Overall, our studies suggest that acquisition and display of multiple, redundant complement regulators is involved in amoebic protection from complement lysis. These findings shed light on a novel strategy for immune evasion by a pathogen. Since other parasites use trogocytosis for cell killing, our findings may apply to the pathogenesis of other infections.",

    "abstract": "While Entamoeba histolytica remains a globally important pathogen, it is dramatically understudied. The tractability of E. histolytica has historically been limited, which is largely due to challenging features of its genome. To enable forward genetics, we constructed and validated the first genome-wide E. histolytica RNAi knockdown mutant library. This library allows for Illumina deep sequencing analysis for quantitative identification of mutants that are enriched or depleted after selection. We developed a novel analysis pipeline to precisely define and quantify gene fragments. We used the library to perform the first RNAi screen in E. histolytica and identified slow growth (SG) mutants. Among genes targeted in SG mutants, many had annotated functions consistent with roles in cellular growth or metabolic pathways. Some targeted genes were annotated as hypothetical or lacked annotated domains, supporting the power of forward genetics in uncovering functional information that cannot be gleaned from databases. While the localization of neither of the proteins targeted in SG1 nor SG2 mutants could be predicted by sequence analysis, we showed experimentally that SG1 localized to the cytoplasm and cell surface, while SG2 localized to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of SG1 led to increased growth, while expression of a truncation mutant did not lead to increased growth, and thus aided in defining functional domains in this protein. Finally, in addition to establishing forward genetics, we uncovered new details of the unusual E. histolytica RNAi pathway. These studies dramatically improve the tractability of E. histolytica and open up the possibility of applying genetics to improve understanding of this important pathogen.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe influence of climate on deep-time plant-insect interactions is becoming increasingly well known, with temperature, CO2 increases (and associated stoichiometric changes in plants), and aridity likely playing a critical role. In our modern climate, all three factors are shifting at an unprecedented rate, with uncertain consequences for biodiversity. To investigate effects of temperature, stoichiometry (specifically that of nitrogen), and aridity on insect herbivory, we explored insect herbivory in three modern floral assemblages and in 39 fossil floras, especially focusing on eight floras around a past hyperthermal event (the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) from Bighorn Basin (BB). We find that higher temperatures were associated with increased herbivory in the past, especially among BB sites. In these BB sites, non-N2-fixing plants experienced a lower richness but higher frequency of herbivory damage than N2-fixing plants. Herbivory frequency but not richness was greater in BB sites compared with contemporaneous, nearby, but less arid sites from Hanna Basin. Compared with deep-time environments, herbivory frequency and richness are higher in modern sites, suggesting that current accelerated warming uniquely impacts plant-insect interactions. Overall, our work addresses multiple aspects of climate change using fossil data while also contextualizing the impact of modern anthropogenic change on Earth's most diverse interactions.",

    "abstract": "PREMISE: Quantifying how closely related plant species differ in susceptibility to insect herbivory is important for understanding the variation in evolutionary pressures on plant functional traits. However, empirically measuring in situ variation in herbivory spanning the geographic range of a plant-insect complex is logistically difficult. Recently, new methods have been developed using herbarium specimens to investigate patterns in plant-insect symbioses across large geographic scales. Such investigations provide insights into how accelerated anthropogenic changes may impact plant-insect interactions that are of ecological or agricultural importance. METHODS: Here, we analyze 274 pressed herbarium samples to investigate variation in herbivory damage in 13 different species of the economically important plant genus Cucurbita (Cucurbitaceae). This collection is composed of specimens of wild, undomesticated Cucurbita that were collected from across their native range, and Cucurbita cultivars collected from both within their native range and from locations where they have been introduced for agriculture in temperate North America. RESULTS: Herbivory is common on individuals of all Cucurbita species collected throughout their geographic ranges. However, estimates of herbivory varied considerably among individuals, with mesophytic species accruing more insect damage than xerophytic species, and wild specimens having more herbivory than specimens collected from human-managed habitats. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that long-term evolutionary changes in habitat from xeric to mesic climates and wild to human-managed habitats may mediate the levels of herbivory pressure from coevolved herbivores. Future investigations into the potential factors that contribute to herbivory may inform the management of domesticated crop plants and their insect herbivores.",

The most common emissions are carbon- or nitrogen-based pollutants that may impact diverse interactions between plants and insect herbivores. However, the effects of vehicle pollution on plant-insect interactions are poorly understood. Here, we combine a city-wide experiment across the Sacramento Metropolitan Area and a laboratory experiment to determine how vehicle emissions affect insect herbivory and leaf nutritional quality. We demonstrate that leaf damage to a native oak species (Quercus lobata) commonly planted across the western US is substantially elevated on trees exposed to vehicle emissions. In the laboratory, caterpillars preferred leaves from highway-adjacent trees and performed better on leaves from those same trees. Synthesis and applications. Together, our studies demonstrate that the heterogeneity in vehicle emissions across cities may explain highly variable patterns of insect herbivory on street trees. Our results also indicate that trees next to highways are particularly vulnerable to multiple stressors, including insect damage. To combat these effects, urban foresters may consider planting trees that are less susceptible to insect herbivory along heavily travelled roadways.",

Plants were assayed for a Mendelian antiherbivore defense that also affects tolerance to abiotic stressors. Urban-rural gradients were associated with the evolution of clines in defense in 47% of cities throughout the world. Variation in the strength of clines was explained by environmental changes in drought stress and vegetation cover that varied among cities. Sequencing 2074 genomes from 26 cities revealed that the evolution of urban-rural clines was best explained by adaptive evolution, but the degree of parallel adaptation varied among cities.

At present, the health implications of vaping at higher temperatures, including exacerbation of pulmonary inflammation, are largely unknown when aerosol dose is considered. To isolate the pulmonary effects of coil temperature, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to e-cigarette aerosols generated at lower (190°C) or higher (250°C) temperature for 3 days, while maintaining a similar chamber aerosol concentration. Increasing coil temperature did not markedly alter aerosol mass-normalized emissions of select carbonyls formed from thermal degradation pathways including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and acetone under the tested environment. Total bronchoalveolar cells, primarily macrophages, were significantly decreased in mice exposed to aerosols generated with higher coil temperatures compared to lower temperature exposures. The gene expression of IFNβ, IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-10 in mouse lung tissue was significantly reduced following e-cigarette exposure under both conditions, compared to filtered air exposure. Higher temperature exposures further exacerbated downregulation of IFNβ and IL-1β. Data suggest that higher temperature vaping might modulate acute pulmonary immune responses, potentially inducing immune suppression, even when normalized for aerosol dose exposure. Coil temperature thus appears to be an important parameter that needs to be regulated to ensure harm reduction for e-cigarette users.",

    "abstract": "Vaping cannabinoids in electronic (e)-cigarette devices is rapidly increasing in popularity, particularly among adolescents, although the chemistry affecting the composition of the vape aerosol is not well understood. This work investigates the formation of aerosol mass, bioactive hydroxyquinones, and harmful or potentially harmful carbonyls from the e-cigarette vaping of natural and synthetic cannabinoids e-liquids in propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (PG/VG) solvent at a 50 mg/mL concentration in a commercial fourth-generation vaping device. The following cannabinoids were studied: cannabidiol (CBD), 8,9-dihydrocannabidiol (H2CBD), 1,2,8,9-tetrahydrocannabidiol (H4CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA). Quantification of analytes was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to accurate mass spectrometry. The addition of cannabinoids significantly increased aerosol and carbonyl formation compared with the PG/VG solvent alone. All cannabinoids in the study formed hydroxyquinones during vaping (up to ∼1% mass conversion) except for CBDA, which primarily decarboxylated to CBD. Hydroxyquinone formation increased and carbonyl formation decreased, with a decreasing number of double bonds among CBD and its synthetic analogues (H2CBD and H4CBD). During the vaping process, ∼3-6% of the cannabinoid mass can be observed as carbonyls under the study conditions. Oxidation of the terpene moiety on the cannabinoids is proposed as a major contributor to carbonyl formation. CBD produced significantly higher concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, diacetyl, and methylglyoxal compared with the other cannabinoid samples. CBG produced significantly higher levels of acetone, methacrolein, and methylglyoxal. Conversion of CBD to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was not observed under the study conditions. The chemical mechanism basis for these observations is discussed. Compared with other modalities of use for CBD and other cannabinoids, vaping has the potential to adversely impact human health by producing harmful products during the heated aerosolization process.",

    "abstract": "The importance of global isoprene emissions has stimulated studies of oxidation mechanisms that follow the initial reaction of isoprene with atmospheric hydroxyl (OH). A key question involves the speed and pathways by which isoprene products isomerize. Some reactions in these mechanisms generate new hydroxyl, perhaps enough to recycle most hydroxyl. This research examines five different isoprene oxidation mechanisms using observations from a 2013 field study in an Alabama forest and a 2014 companion study in the Caltech Environmental Chamber. Model mechanisms and observations were compared for OH, hydroperoxyl (HO2), and the isoprene oxidation products: isoprene hydroxyhydroperoxide (ISOPOOH), isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX), hydroxyacetone, formaldehyde, methacrolein, and methyl vinyl ketone. Observed hydroxyl is generally simulated within uncertainties for both the chamber and the field studies, indicating that hydroxyl recycling is well captured by current model mechanisms, although two mechanisms are slightly better than the other three. When the observed and modeled uncertainties are considered, no currently accepted mechanism is clearly superior to the others for simulating isoprene products. For atmospheric conditions typical of forests-abundant isoprene and low nitric oxide-these model mechanisms produce concentrations of isoprene products that can be substantially different from observations and from each other. This result suggests both the common and different parts of the chemical mechanisms need to be reexamined, particularly by observing the later-generation products directly.",

    "abstract": "Electronic (e-) cigarette formulations containing nicotine salts from a range of organic acid conjugates and pH values have dominated the commercial market. The acids in the nicotine salt formulations may alter the redox environment in e-cigarettes, impacting free radical formation in e-cigarette aerosol. Here, the generation of aerosol mass and free radicals from a fourth-generation e-cigarette device was evaluated at 2 wt % nicotine salts (pH 7, 30:70 mixture propylene glycol to vegetable glycerin) across eight organic acids used in e-liquids: benzoic acid (BA), salicylic acid (SLA), lactic acid (LA), levulinic acid (LVA), succinic acid (SA), malic acid (MA), tartaric acid (TA), and citric acid (CA). Furthermore, 2 wt % BA nicotine salts were studied at the following nicotine to acid ratios: 1:2 (pH 4), 1:1 (pH 7), and 2:1 (pH 8), in comparison with freebase nicotine (pH 10). Radical yields were quantified by spin-trapping and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The EPR spectra of free radicals in the nicotine salt aerosol matched those generated from the Fenton reaction, which are primarily hydroxyl (OH) radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although the aerosol mass formation was not significantly different for most of the tested nicotine salts and acid concentrations, notable ROS yields were observed only from BA, CA, and TA under the study conditions. The e-liquids with SLA, LA, LVA, SA, and MA produced less ROS than the 2 wt % freebase nicotine e-liquid, suggesting that organic acids may play dual roles in the production and scavenging of ROS. For BA nicotine salts, it was found that the ROS yield increased with a higher acid concentration (or a lower nicotine to acid ratio). The observation that BA nicotine salts produce the highest ROS yield in aerosol generated from a fourth-generation vape device, which increases with acid concentration, has important implications for ROS-mediated health outcomes that may be relevant to consumers, manufacturers, and regulatory agencies.",

    "issued": "2025-03",
    "abstract": "Bangladesh, with its diverse coastal and marine ecosystems, holds immense potential to harness low-trophic extractive mariculture (LTEM) as a key component of its sustainable blue economy. Considering the present national interest, this study provides a comprehensive assessment of the current status of LTEM in Bangladesh, identifying its challenges and offers strategic interventions for future development. Using a mixed-method approach, the research integrates an extensive literature review, key informant interviews, field research experiences, and stakeholder workshops involving policymakers, industry leaders, academia, NGOs, and community representatives. Based on the synthesized information, key challenges were broadly classified into four categories, which were further sub-divided into several thematic issues, including eight for technical, five for environment, five for socio-economic, and two for regulatory and policy constraints, revealing systemic inefficiencies such as poor suitability mapping, technological limitation, weak value chains, poor coordination among stakeholders, and insufficient research investment. These issues contribute to knowledge gaps, coastal hydro-dynamics conditions, inconsistent practices, and hinder the development of effective regulatory frameworks, limiting market access, product quality, and export potential. In response, twelve thematic intervention areas were identified, which were further refined during plenary discussions in the workshops to form a detailed roadmap for the period 2025–2035. The roadmap outlines a series of sequential actions and identifies key actors for each of the twelve thematic areas, with an emphasis on addressing the barriers to LTEM development. By shifting from a project-focused approach to a systems-oriented strategy, the framework integrates stakeholder perspectives and lessons learned to strengthen Bangladesh's LTEM sector.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interlinkages between ecological conditions and mariculture practices are vital for enhancing growth performance and nutritional profiling of marine bivalves. However, highly productive mariculture practices under different local ecological conditions have not been comprehensively documented to achieve sustainable outcomes. This study investigates how depth (0.5 m, 1 m, and 1.5 m) and site-specific ecological factors of three farming sites (Moheshkhali, Khurushkul, and Choufaldandi) influence the growth performance and nutritional profile of green mussels (Perna viridis) in floating raft mariculture systems in the southeast coast of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. For this purpose, 20 uniform green mussel spats (2.9 ± 0.08 g) were inoculated across three cultivation depths in ten replicated mussel net socks, which were suspended vertically in the water column from horizontal floating rafts and cultured for six months (October-March) at the above-mentioned three farming sites. Among environmental factors, the two-way ANOVA model displayed both depth- and site-specific significant variation of ecological parameters (DO, salinity, turbidity, NO3-N, PO4-P, Chlorophyll-a) and food availability (Coscinodiscophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, and Dinophyceae) in the studied areas. Our findings based on the two-way ANOVA model also revealed that both the depth and site-specific ecological settings significantly impact (p < 0.05) growth performance, shell morphometry and nutritional profiles of green mussels. Various univariate and multivariate analyses further revealed that the above ecological factors are closely interlinked with the observed differences in growth performance and nutritional profiles of mussels. By integrating these ecological and environmental variables, our study provides actionable insights for optimizing green mussel farming practices, potentially leading to improved yield and nutritional quality in floating raft systems.",

    "abstract": "The widespread contamination of aquatic environments by microplastics (MPs), alongside other pollutants, has emerged as a critical global concern, posing significant risks to fish populations. This study investigated the impacts of microplastic ingestion on the phenotypic traits, survival rates, and antioxidant activities of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Three experimental groups were established: (T1) a control group fed a standard commercial diet (4% of body weight) twice daily, (T2) a group fed a mixed diet of 2% commercial pellets and 2% MPs twice daily, and (T3) a group fed 4% commercial pellets on the first day, no feed on the second day, and 4% MPs added directly to the water on the third day. Results demonstrated that tilapia exposed to MPs exhibited significantly lower survival rates, decreased body weight, reduced standard length, smaller eye diameters, and diminished body areas compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MP-exposed fish displayed elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reduced catalase activity, indicating altered antioxidant defense mechanisms. Proximate analysis revealed no significant differences in crude protein, moisture, and lipid content among the groups (P > 0.05), except for ash content, which was significantly higher in MP-exposed fish (P < 0.01). Geometric morphometric analysis did not reveal significant shape variations among the groups (P > 0.05), although the control group exhibited a significantly larger centroid size (an indicator of overall body size) than the MP-exposed groups (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that microplastic ingestion can have detrimental effects on the survival, growth, antioxidant status, and body composition of juvenile tilapia. This study underscores the critical need to consider the potential impacts of microplastic pollution on tilapia farming practices in the open water system.",

The study assessed semi-intensive shrimp farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) on health and safety during their farm activities. The KAP model examined working circumstances, exposures, health complaints, diseases, current health status, and job satisfaction. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 158 semi-intensive shrimp farmers from Bangladesh's Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat districts. Type-based data analysis was done. We used Spearman's rank correlation and multiple linear regression. Only 35% of respondents said that they knew the health safety of chemicals and pesticides used in semi-intensive shrimp farms and that safety training is needed, and all farmers wanted to attend when available. At least 74% of farmers used masks when handling pesticides, fertilizers, and chemicals. 40.50% of farmers used protective clothing, 91% cleansed their hands, legs, and face after each day's work, and 94% felt that sanitization reduces pesticide, fertilizer, and chemical pollution. A significant positive correlation coefficient was established in KAP. Education significantly increased knowledge. Practices varied with health and safety training. Results suggest that attitudes determine practices, where knowledge is significantly associated with attitudes. A comprehensive health safety and hygiene training program for all shrimp farmers should be developed to raise awareness, reduce illness outbreaks, and preserve healthy living.",

    "issued": "2025-01",
    "abstract": "Production performance and biochemical characteristics of seaweed under varying cultivation strategies and ecological conditions provide crucial insights for improving sustainable farming practices. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the production performance and biochemical profile of sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) under three farming systems, namely floating long-line (FLL), off-bottom long-line (OBLL), and off-bottom net (OBN), and three site-specific (Khurushkul, Nuniachora, and Sonapara) ecological conditions for a period of nine months (October 2022 to June 2023). Depending on the site suitability for different cultivation systems, 15 plots (5 FLL, 5 OBLL, and 5 OBN) were established in Nuniachora, 10 plots (5 FLL, 5 OBLL) were established in Sonapara, and 5 plots (FLL) were established in Khurushkul of the Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh. Depending on the cultivation months, we partially harvested U. lactuca every 15–30 days once it reached 25–35 cm in length. Results showed that the gross weight biomass (GWB) of U. lactuca cultured in the FLL (F = 200.43, p < 0.001) cultivation system was 45.38% and 39.85% higher compared to OBN and OBLL, respectively. The average daily growth rate (DGR) was found to be 11%–13% higher in the FLL method (F = 236.11, p < 0.001). Location-based comparisons indicated a significantly higher (p < 0.05) U. lactuca production in Khurushkul, followed by the Nuniarchora, and the lowest was observed in Sonapara. Seasonality influenced the production performances of U. lactuca, with significantly higher (p < 0.05) growth observed from December to March due to favourable physio-chemical parameters. Multivariate analysis revealed that high salinity, pH, and nutrient concentrations positively influenced growth performances, while high temperature, turbidity, and total suspended solids (TSS) had negative effects. U. lactuca harvested from the FLL and OBN systems contained 14.3% and 9.44% higher amounts of protein (F = 36.77, p < 0.001) than the OBN system. The fatty acid analysis showed that U. lactuca from the FLL and OBN systems contained a significantly lower amount of saturated fatty acids but a higher amount of monounsaturated and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to the OBLL system. Among the heavy metals and minerals analyzed, U. lactuca harvested from the FLL system contained significantly (p < 0.05) higher amounts of Na and K and lower amounts of Pb, Cr, Co, and Fe. The findings of the present study underscore the superiority of the floating long-line cultivation system for U. lactuca, highlighting its potential for sustainable farming practices to address global food security and utilization in various industrial applications.",

ANIMALS: A group of seven healthy male neutered cats, with body mass 5.2 ± 0.4 kg and aged 1-2 years. METHODS: Cats were implanted with a telemetric transmitter for remote recording of mean arterial pressure and heart rate before beginning the study. Each cat received a total of six treatments, coadministered in a single syringe, each at least 2 weeks apart: dexmedetomidine (25 μg kg-1, D) + vatinoxan (600 μg kg-1, V) + ketamine (2.5 mg kg-1, K2.5) intramuscularly (IM) (DVK2.5IM); D + V + ketamine (5 mg kg-1, K5) IM (DVK5IM); D + V + ketamine (10 mg kg-1, K10) IM (DVK10IM); D + K5 IM (DK5IM); D + V + K5 subcutaneously (SC) (DVK5SC); or D + V + K5 intravenously (IV) (DVK5IV). Select physiologic variables and time to recumbency, immobilization, first movement, head lift, return to sternal recumbency and walking were recorded. Quality of sedation/anesthesia was assessed using a visual analog score. Response to noxious electrical stimulation was assessed at 10 minute intervals. RESULTS: Heart rate (beats minute-1) was significantly greater in DVK5IM (overall mean ± standard deviation 142 ± 19) than in DK5IM (115 ± 16). No treatment consistently prevented movement in response to noxious stimulation. Time to first movement was significantly shorter in DVK2.5IM (45 ± 10 minutes) than in DVK10IM (93 ± 25 minutes), and in DVK5IM (53 ± 12 minutes) than in DK5IM (95 ± 39 minutes). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dexmedetomidine-vatinoxan-ketamine combinations, at the doses studied, may be useful to produce sedation, but do not appear to consistently produce anesthesia as characterized by immobility in response to noxious stimulation.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize the effect of buprenorphine on the minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane (MACiso) in cats. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, crossover, experimental study. ANIMALS: A group of six healthy male neutered cats, aged 2-8 years with body mass 5.0 ± 0.3 kg. METHODS: The MACiso had been determined in each cat in a previous study. Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. Catheters were placed in a medial saphenous vein for drug and fluid administration and in a jugular vein for blood sampling. Buprenorphine was administered intravenously using a target-controlled infusion system to reach and maintain plasma concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng mL-1, and MACiso was determined in duplicate at each concentration using the tail clamp technique. Four target plasma buprenorphine concentrations were administered on each study day, with at least 2 weeks between experiments. Blood was sampled after the second MAC determination at each target for determination of plasma buprenorphine concentration. RESULTS: A significant effect of buprenorphine on MAC was found; however, pairwise comparisons to MACiso without buprenorphine did not reach statistical significance. Maximum reduction in MACiso in individual cats ranged from 2% to 34% at plasma buprenorphine concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 8.15 ng mL-1. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although buprenorphine significantly affected MACiso in cats, the magnitude of the effect and the plasma concentration at which the largest effect occurred was highly variable among cats, limiting the clinical usefulness of buprenorphine as an agent to reduce MAC in cats.",

ANIMALS: A group of six healthy male neutered cats, aged 1-2 years, weighing 5.4 ± 0.3 kg. METHODS: Each cat was administered six treatments: dexmedetomidine (25 μg kg-1; D) + vatinoxan (600 μg kg-1; V) + ketamine (2.5 mg kg-1; K2.5) intramuscularly (IM) (DVK2.5IM); D + V + ketamine (5 mg kg-1; K5) IM (DVK5IM); D + V + ketamine (10 mg kg-1; K10) IM (DVK10IM); D + K5 IM (DK5IM); D + V + K5 subcutaneously (SC) (DVK5SC); or D + V + K5 intravenously (IV) (DVK5IV). Venous blood samples were collected before treatment injection, and at various times up to 6 hours thereafter. Plasma dexmedetomidine, vatinoxan and ketamine concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Compartment models were fitted to the time-plasma dexmedetomidine, vatinoxan and ketamine data using nonlinear mixed effect modeling, including covariates for the effects of vatinoxan and the dose of ketamine where appropriate. RESULTS: Two-compartment models best fitted the time-plasma dexmedetomidine, vatinoxan and ketamine concentrations. The models predicted that vatinoxan increases the clearance of dexmedetomidine and decreases the bioavailability of IM ketamine and that increasing doses of ketamine increase the volume of the central compartment for dexmedetomidine and the bioavailability of IM ketamine. The volume of distribution at steady state (mL kg-1) and metabolic clearance (mL minute-1 kg-1) were 1012-2429 and 12.5-15.4 for dexmedetomidine, 666 and 3.7 for vatinoxan and 2260 and 23.8 for ketamine, respectively. Bioavailability (%) for IM and SC dexmedetomidine, vatinoxan and ketamine was 83 and 95, 99 and 95 and 60-100 and 100, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine and the bioavailability of ketamine were affected by vatinoxan and the dose of ketamine.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize the correlation, agreement and concordance of cardiac output (CO) measured with transthoracic ultrasound and the correlation and concordance of aortic blood flow (ABF) minute distance (MD) measured by transesophageal Doppler with CO measured by pulmonary artery thermodilution (PATD) in cats. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. ANIMALS: A group of six healthy male neutered cats, aged 2-8 years and weighing 5.3 ± 0.3 kg. METHODS: Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. CO was measured by PATD (COPATD) and transthoracic echocardiography (COECHO). ABF MD was measured using an esophageal Doppler flow probe aligned with descending ABF. All measurements were made under three conditions: dexmedetomidine (20 μg kg-1) intravenously; atipamezole (200 μg kg-1) intramuscularly and atropine (20 μg kg-1) intravenously as needed to achieve a minimum heart rate of 140 beats minute-1; and dopamine (20 μg kg-1 minute-1) intravenously in that order. Correlation between COPATD and COECHO, and COPATD and Doppler MD was evaluated using repeated measures correlation. Agreement between COPATD and COECHO was evaluated using Bland-Altman method. Differences between consecutive pairs of CO measurements were calculated for concordance analysis. RESULTS: Correlation between COPATD and COECHO and between COPATD and MD was significant (p < 0.001), with correlation coefficients greater than 0.92. A bias of > 27% and upper limits of agreement of 66% were found between COPATD and COECHO. Concordance rate with COPATD was 76-80% for COECHO and 72% for MD. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Echocardiographic methods for the measurement of CO showed poor agreement and concordance with PATD. MD showed poor concordance with PATD. As such, these methods cannot be used as an alternative to PATD nor can they appropriately track changes in CO in anesthetized cats.",

    "issued": "2023-04",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and resection of CRC metastases confined to the liver is the treatment of choice when feasible. Ferumoxytol is an off-label contrast agent that opacifies vasculature and may be helpful in distinguishing metastases from small hemangiomas and blood vessels on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of MRI using a standard gadoxetic acid protocol and a combined gadoxetic acid/ferumoxytol protocol in patients with suspected colorectal hepatic metastases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved, single-institution, retrospective study, eight patients underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI, supplemented with additional T1-weighted ferumoxytol enhanced sequences. Two radiologists in consensus identified all metastases using all available sequences, which served as the reference standard. Two different radiologists reviewed each exam twice, once using the standard protocol and once with additional ferumoxytol sequences. The detection rate was estimated as the predicted probability of a metastasis along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) using hierarchical logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 49 metastases were identified. The mean diameter was 10 mm, measured in greatest axial dimension (median=7 mm; range=2-70 mm). Readers 1 and 2 had detection rates of 69.6% (95% CI = 48.2-85.0) and 53.1% (95% CI = 35.2-70.3) for gadoxetic acid alone and 98.0% (95% CI = 86.3-99.7) and 83.5% (95% CI = 59.3-94.7) for combined protocol. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary investigation, adding ferumoxytol-enhanced sequences to gadoxetic acid liver MRI protocol increased the detection rate of CRC hepatic metastases and may aid in preoperative decision making.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of the bcc refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) NbMoTaW with columnar and equiaxed microstructures and a nanoscale metal oxide layer on the grain boundaries are investigated at ambient temperatures (RT) to 1200 °C. Under compression, the alloy shows a yield strength, σy, of ⁓1390 ± 20 MPa at RT and retains a high yield strength, σy, of ⁓301.5 MPa at 1200 °C. However, in tension, the fracture strengths, σf, of both columnar and equiaxed microstructures are far lower - below 70 MPa - and the material fails in the elastic regime without showing any measurable ductility at all temperatures. The fracture mechanisms in tension transition from transgranular cleavage at RT to a mixture of transgranular and intergranular fracture at 800 °C to a complete intergranular fracture at 1200 °C due to selective weakening of the metal oxide layer on the grain boundaries driven by a structural change. The transition in the fracture mechanism in the equiaxed microstructure promotes extrinsic toughening at higher temperatures, resulting in a ⁓6.4 times higher fracture toughness (KIc ⁓10.3 MPa√m) at 1200 °C compared to that at RT. NbMoTaW is a well-known RHEA, but the poor tensile strength and fracture toughness measured in this study highlight the critical importance of investigating the mechanical properties of these high-temperature RHEAs in tension.",

We examined the strength and fracture toughness of a bcc refractory alloy, NbTaTiHf, from 77 to 1473 kelvin. This alloy's behavior differed from that of comparable systems by having fracture toughness over 253 MPa·m1/2, which we attribute to a dynamic competition between screw and edge dislocations in controlling the plasticity at a crack tip. Whereas the glide and intersection of screw and mixed dislocations promotes strain hardening controlling uniform deformation, the coordinated slip of <111> edge dislocations with {110} and {112} glide planes prolongs nonuniform strain through formation of kink bands. These bands suppress strain hardening by reorienting microscale bands of the crystal along directions of higher resolved shear stress and continually nucleate to accommodate localized strain and distribute damage away from a crack tip.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse intensities in the electron diffraction patterns of concentrated face-centered cubic solid solutions have been widely attributed to chemical short-range order, although this connection has been recently questioned. This article explores the many nonordering origins of commonly reported features using a combination of experimental electron microscopy and multislice diffraction simulations, which suggest that diffuse intensities largely represent thermal and static displacement scattering. A number of observations may reflect additional contributions from planar defects, surface terminations incommensurate with bulk periodicity, or weaker dynamical effects.",

    "abstract": "The tensile creep behavior of a vacuum arc-melted Nb45Ta25Ti15Hf15 refractory high entropy alloy was investigated over a constant true stress range of 50–300 MPa at a temperature of 1173 K. Creep tests were carried out in both high vacuum (5 × 10−6 torr) and ultrahigh purity Ar gas to examine the environmental effect. The samples tested in vacuum exhibited power law behavior with a stress exponent of 4.1 and exceptional tensile creep ductility, whereas those tested in Ar suffered significant embrittlement due to HfO2 formation at grain boundaries, which was exacerbated at low applied stresses where extended exposure to residual O2 gas resulted in more extensive brittle intergranular fracture. Phase decomposition occurred after long-term thermal exposure, where a second Hf-rich body-centered cubic phase formed predominantly at grain boundaries but did not cause embrittlement. Compared to the equiatomic TaNbHfZrTi (Senkov alloy) and face-centered cubic multiple-principal element alloys, Nb45Ta25Ti15Hf15 has superior creep resistance, especially at high applied stresses, while maintaining excellent creep ductility. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that creep deformation in Nb45Ta25Ti15Hf15 at 1173 K is controlled by cross-kink collisions from screw dislocations that results in dipole drag at lower strain rates and jog drag at higher strain rates.",

These so-termed refractory high-entropy superalloys (RHSAs) can show remarkable compressive strength up to temperatures exceeding 1200 °C. Here, we examine the microstructure and properties - compressive, tensile, and fracture toughness - of a precipitation-hardened, body-centered cubic, RHSA, Al0.5Nb1.25Ta1.25TiZr, at ambient temperature (RT) to 1200 °C. Two dual-phase microstructures comprising ordered B2 (brittle) and disordered A2 (ductile) phases were produced in this alloy - one with B2 as the matrix, the other with A2 - for evaluation of the mechanical properties. Under compression, both microstructures display RT compressive strengths above 1.5 GPa and considerable ductility exceeding 40% at elevated temperatures; the alloy with the A2 matrix has ∼15% compressive ductility even at RT. However, properties are very different under tensile loading; at all temperatures, both microstructures fail predominately in an intergranular mode in the elastic regime at a fracture stress less than 200 MPa and ductility below 0.15%. The microstructure with the A2 matrix has a KIc fracture toughness of ∼15 MPa√m at RT, although at all temperatures above 800 °C, measured KIc values for both dual-phase microstructures are less than 5 MPa√m. In this study, we investigate the microstructural origin of these mechanical properties, and emphasize the importance of evaluating these alloys in tension.",

    "issued": "2024-06-01",
    "abstract": "Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review serves to briefly summarize the current literature surveying the incidence of posttranscatheter aortic valve replacement acute kidney injury (TAVR AKI). Furthermore, this review extends itself to evaluate and potentially address modifiable risk factors, while acknowledging non-modifiable risk factors in the perioperative setting. These modifiable risk factors include but are not limited to access method, perioperative hypotension events, and need for blood transfusion in the setting of preoperative anemia. Recent Findings: Recent retrospective studies have highlighted the incidence of post-TAVR AKI, citing as high as 1 in 6 patients. Despite exclusion of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from pivotal TAVR trials, data shows that over 50% of high-risk patients suffer > 3a chronic kidney disease (CKD) and about 10% of them suffer > 4 CKD, with the risk of AKI increasing significantly at each stage of CKD advancement. Meta-analyses have shown that patients who underwent TAVR via transfemoral (TF) approach compared to those who had transapical (TA) or transaortic (TaO) approach had significantly less AKI post-TAVR. Furthermore, in patients who developed post-TAVR AKI, 55% of them had received packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion, while only 21% of the patients who did not receive pRBCs develop post-TAVR AKI (p =.002). Post-TAVR AKI has been shown in multiple studies that it is an independent risk factor for increased short term and long-term mortality. These findings together highlight both the clinical significance and continued perioperative vigilance to further improve clinical outcomes. Summary: This review aims to summarize recent literature regarding the association of AKI in the perioperative setting of TAVR. In addition, it parses the risk factors into both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Furthermore, it provides some recommendations including procedure approach, appreciating transfusion implication, and most importantly, preventing hypotension events in the perioperative period.",

    "abstract": "With continued technological advancement and technical improvement of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), it has become a desirable treatment option for aortic valve stenosis. Its minimally invasive approach compared to surgical aortic valve replacement offers the treatment to a broader patient population, mainly non-surgical candidates. A feared complication of TAVR is the occlusion of coronary artery ostium by the native aortic valve leaflet due to its displacement by the expanded transcatheter valve. Bioprosthetic or native aortic scallop intentional laceration to prevent iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction (BASILICA) is a technique developed to mitigate this risk by creating a lengthwise laceration of the left and/or right aortic valve leaflets prior to TAVR. Patient outcomes following TAVR with BASILICA have been promising. Meticulous preoperative examination, patient selection, and hemodynamic management are imperative. With continued refinement, BASILICA may further expand the application of TAVR to patients at high risk for coronary occlusion associated with the procedure.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy and improved medical technology allow increasing numbers of elderly patients to undergo cardiac surgery. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Complications can lead to worsened quality of life, shortened life expectancy and higher healthcare costs. Reducing perioperative complications, especially severe adverse events, is key to improving outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The objective of this study is to determine whether perioperative lipid-lowering medication use is associated with a reduced risk of complications and mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: After IRB approval, we reviewed charts of 9,518 patients who underwent cardiac surgery with CPB at three medical centers between July 2001 and June 2015. The relationship between perioperative lipid-lowering treatment and postoperative outcome was investigated. 3,988 patients who underwent CABG met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Patients were divided into lipid-lowering or non-lipid-lowering treatment groups. RESULTS: A total of 3,988 patients were included in the final analysis. Compared to the patients without lipid-lowering medications, the patients with lipid-lowering medications had lower postoperative neurologic complications and overall mortality (P < 0.05). Propensity weighted risk-adjustment showed that lipid-lowering medication reduced in-hospital total complications (odds ratio (OR) = 0.856; 95% CI 0.781-0.938; P < 0.001); all neurologic complications (OR = 0.572; 95% CI 0.441-0.739; P < 0.001) including stroke (OR = 0.481; 95% CI 0.349-0.654; P < 0.001); in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.616; 95% CI 0.432-0.869; P = 0.006; P < 0.001); and overall mortality (OR = 0.723; 95% CI 0.634-0.824; P < 0.001). In addition, the results indicated postoperative lipid-lowering medication use was associated with improved long-term survival in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative lipid-lowering medication use was associated with significantly reduced postoperative adverse events and improved overall outcome in elderly patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB.",

    "abstract": "Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disorder frequently affecting patients as they get older, and resulting in life-altering symptoms such as dyspnea, angina, pre-syncope, and syncope, which are often made worse with exertion. Often, AS is caused by age-related calcification of the valve; in addition, its pathogenetic mechanism also involves the fact that bicuspid aortic valves tend to narrow rapidly compared to other three-leaflet valve. As the aging population continues to grow, an increasing number of patients are seeking treatment for AS, which makes therapies for AS continuing to evolve and improve. Initially, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), requiring a median sternotomy and an extended postoperative intensive care unit stay, was the predominant therapy for patients with AS. Over the past few years, with the trend toward minimally invasive surgery, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become more popular, offering an alternative to the traditional surgical approach, especially for patients who would previously be denied surgical replacement[1–2]. Consequently, the candidates for TAVR are often older (age >70 years) and have multiple, frequently moderate-to-severe comorbidities[3].",

    "issued": "2024",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Children with syndromic craniosynostosis are known to have a high propensity for associated airway abnormalities. However, this has not been investigated using a large-scale national database. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kid's Inpatient Database was queried for craniosynostosis patients. Data on demographics, airway diagnoses, and comorbidities were analyzed. RESULTS: Four thousand nine hundred fourteen children with craniosynostosis with a mean age of 1.7±3.6 years were identified. Of these, 51% were female and 136 children had an associated syndrome. Choanal atresia was present in 31% of patients with an associated syndrome versus 2.5% without. Syndromic patients are 4.59 times more likely (95% CI 2.65-7.94) to have airway anomalies than nonsyndromic patients. After age and sex adjustment, craniosynostosis patients have higher likelihoods of presenting with other anomalies, with syndromic having higher incidences: 5.23 times (95% CI 2.63-10.39) more likely to have laryngomalacia, 18.30 times (95% CI 3.27-102.36) more likely to have tracheal stenosis, and 4.58 times (95% CI 1.36- 15.43) more likely to have tracheomalacia. Incidence of tracheostomy was 5.84 times (95% CI 3.77-9.04) higher in syndromic patients with craniosynostosis. Tracheostomy rates were 28.4% and 4.6% in craniosynostosis patients with and without associated syndrome, respectively. CONCLUSION: Syndromic craniosynostosis patients had significantly higher incidences of choanal atresia and other airway anomalies. Given a high incidence of airway anomalies, syndromic craniosynostosis patients likely warrant routine airway evaluation. Providers should also be vigilant about airway evaluation in patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis when aerodigestive symptoms arise.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Improper embryological development of the clivus, a bony structure that comprises part of the skull base, can lead to a clival canal defect. Previously thought to be a benign condition, clival canals have been reported to be associated with meningitis and meningoceles. In this review, the authors sought to present an unpublished case of a patient with a clival canal defect associated with meningitis and to evaluate all other reported cases. METHODS: In October 2020, a search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted to identify all cases of clival canals reported from January 1, 1980, through October 31, 2020. RESULTS: Including the case presented herein, 13 cases of clival canals, 11 in children (84.6%) and 2 in adults (15.4%), have been identified. Of the pediatric patients, 5 (45.5%) had an associated meningocele, and 8 (72.7%) had meningitis. Nine of the 13 patients (69.2%) had defects that were treated surgically, 5 (38.5%) by a transnasal approach and 4 (30.8%) by a transoral approach. Two patients (15.4%) were treated with drainage and antibiotics, 1 patient (7.7%) was treated solely with antibiotics, and 1 patient (7.7%) was not treated. In the literature review, 8 reports of clival canals were found to be associated with meningitis, further contributing to the notion that the clival canal may be an overlooked source of recurrent infection. In several of these cases, surgical repair of the lesion was curative, thus preventing continued episodes of meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: When a patient has recurrent meningitis with no clear cause, taking a closer look at clival anatomy is recommended. In addition, if a clival canal defect has been identified, surgical repair should be considered a safe and effective primary treatment option.",

Ensuring appropriate follow-up of failed newborn hearing screening is crucial to avoid delay in initiation of treatment for hearing loss. The most common etiology for congenital hearing loss is genetic, but some cases can be acquired. Understanding of the etiology aids in counseling for the family and in direction of treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment results in dramatically improved speech and developmental outcomes for affected children. Treatment including amplification, speech therapy, adaptations in the classroom, and family support leads to gains in academic performance, parental satisfaction, and quality of life. Early cochlear implantation has been shown to be beneficial in obtaining speech and language skills in patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss and should be considered in the appropriate patient population.

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Patients with cleft palate and other causes of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) suffer adverse effects on social interactions and communication. Measurement of these patient-reported outcomes is needed to help guide surgical and nonsurgical care. OBJECTIVES: To further validate the VPI Effects on Life Outcomes (VELO) instrument, measure the change in quality of life (QOL) after speech surgery, and test the association of change in speech with change in QOL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective descriptive cohort including children and young adults undergoing speech surgery for VPI in a tertiary academic center. Participants completed the validated VELO instrument before and after surgical treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome measures were preoperative and postoperative VELO scores and the perceptual speech assessment of speech intelligibility. The VELO scores are divided into subscale domains. Changes in VELO after surgery were analyzed using linear regression models. VELO scores were analyzed as a function of speech intelligibility adjusting for age and cleft type. The correlation between speech intelligibility rating and VELO scores was estimated using the polyserial correlation. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (13 males and 16 females) were included. Mean (SD) age was 7.9 (4.1) years (range, 4-20 years). Pharyngeal flap was used in 14 (48%) cases, Furlow palatoplasty in 12 (41%), and sphincter pharyngoplasty in 1 (3%). The mean (SD) preoperative speech intelligibility rating was 1.71 (1.08), which decreased postoperatively to 0.79 (0.93) in 24 patients who completed protocol (P < .01). The VELO scores improved after surgery (P<.001) as did most subscale scores. Caregiver impact did not change after surgery (P = .36). Speech Intelligibility was correlated with preoperative and postoperative total VELO score (P < .01) and to preoperative subscale domains (situational difficulty [VELO-SiD, P = .005] and perception by others [VELO-PO, P = .05]) and postoperative subscale domains (VELO-SiD [P = .03], VELO-PO [P = .003]). Neither the VELO total nor subscale score change after surgery was correlated with change in speech intelligibility. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Speech surgery improves VPI-specific quality of life. We confirmed validation in a population of untreated patients with VPI and included pharyngeal flap surgery, which had not previously been included in validation studies. The VELO instrument provides patient-specific outcomes, which allows a broader understanding of the social, emotional, and physical effects of VPI. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.",

    "abstract": "Wetlands play a vital role in contaminant cycling and uptake. Understanding how sulfate (SO42‒) influences the conversion of inorganic mercury (Hg(II)) to toxic methylmercury (MeHg) is critical for predicting wetland responses to land use and climate change. Here, we sampled surface and pore waters across SO42‒ gradients in three freshwater Everglades wetlands to assess linkages between SO42‒, MeHg, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and inorganic sulfide (S(‒II)). Increasing SO42‒ concentrations increase S(‒II) and DOM concentrations and DOM aromaticity. MeHg concentration show a unimodal response to surface water SO42‒, which reflect high Hg(II) methylation at low-to-intermediate SO42‒concentration (2-12 mg/L) and low Hg(II) methylation at higher SO42‒concentrations ( > 12 mg/L). MeHg concentrations in surface waters correlate positively with MeHg concentrations in prey fish. The coherent biogeochemical relationships between SO42‒ and MeHg concentrations and biologic uptake improve MeHg risk assessment for aquatic food webs and are globally relevant due to anthropogenic and climate-driven increases in SO42‒.",

    "abstract": "Water column hypoxia is a key process influencing methylmercury (MeHg) production and availability in waterbodies worldwide. During seasonal destratification, large, short-lived pulses of aqueous MeHg may be released into the subsequently mixed water column, but little is known about the fate of these pulses, particularly whether there are concomitant increases in MeHg uptake into aquatic food webs. We examined the magnitude and timing of MeHg uptake across several trophic guilds relative to the reservoir stratification status using biweekly mercury data from water, zooplankton, and fish (Bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus and Smallmouth Bass, Micropterus dolomieu). Zooplankton MeHg concentrations increased by up to 250% during destratification, concurrent with increases in aqueous MeHg concentrations. Zooplankton and filter-passing MeHg concentrations were positively correlated when the reservoir was mixed (R2 = 0.95) and destratifying (R2 = 0.57) but not while the reservoir was stratified (R2 = 0.21). Mercury concentrations in adult bluegill and juveniles of both fish species increased 20-70% following destratification, with responses lagging 4-8 weeks behind those in water and zooplankton MeHg. Mercury concentrations in piscivorous adult bass varied little over the course of the study. Our findings demonstrate the responsiveness of reservoir food webs to pulses in MeHg availability, suggesting that these pulses could play an important role in biotic MeHg exposure within and downstream of reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) contamination of aquatic food webs is controlled in part by the formation and accumulation of toxic and bioaccumulative methylmercury (MeHg). MeHg production is mediated by metabolically diverse microorganisms carrying the hgcAB gene pair, while the demethylation reaction is mediated by several biotic and abiotic processes. However, the relative importance of these two processes on MeHg accumulation and the environmental factors that influence them are poorly characterized, especially in eutrophic environments. In this study, both Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation in a eutrophic freshwater lake were linked to ambient MeHg concentrations and hgcA abundance and expression. High methylation rate potentials indicated in situ MeHg formation was a key source of MeHg to the water column, driven by high hgcA abundance and transcription. Molybdate treatment decreased methylation rate potentials, highlighting the importance of sulfate reduction in driving MeHg formation. Sulfate-reducing bacteria accounted for over 50% of the hgcA gene transcription, despite representing less than 10% of the hgcA-carrying microbial community. An arsR-like transcriptional regulator preceded many hgcA sequences; these were transcriptionally active and linked to lower hgcA expression. Overall, this study elucidates the microbial and biogeochemical processes that influence the in situ formation of MeHg in understudied eutrophic freshwater environments.",

    "abstract": "The quality and quantity of organic matter (OM) in a river system directly affects ecosystem health; thus, managers benefit from an in-depth understanding of the drivers and sources of OM. In the Snake River, a highly altered river-reservoir system in the semi-arid western United States, OM production and loading are key drivers of reservoir anoxia, which leads to several deleterious processes such as mercury methylation. However, sources and quantities of OM to the Snake River, and the effects of impoundment on OM moving through the river-reservoir system, are not well understood. Particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate nitrogen (PN), chlorophyll a (chl-a), and δ15N–PN and δ13C–POC isotopic ratios were measured bi-weekly for over 2 years at four locations through the Snake River Hells Canyon Reservoir Complex to determine spatial and temporal patterns of OM quantities and sources. POC concentrations increased through the riverine zone upstream of the reservoirs, likely due to in situ primary production and/or inputs from tributaries and agricultural drains; then decreased through the most upstream reservoir likely due to particle settling. Isotopic ratios and other OM source indicators (δ15N–PN, δ13C–POC, POC:PN, chl-a:POC) show that the dominant source of particulate OM was phytoplankton with seasonal terrestrial/macrophytic inputs. Results highlight the effects of major tributary and agricultural drain inputs, primary production, and impoundment on OM composition and concentration through a large river-reservoir system and may inform water quality management efforts in this and similar systems.",

Here, we present an emergent threat to Arctic watersheds based on observations from 75 streams in Alaska’s Brooks Range that recently turned orange, reflecting increased loading of iron and toxic metals. Using remote sensing, we constrain the timing of stream discoloration to the last 10 years, a period of rapid warming and snowfall, suggesting impairment is likely due to permafrost thaw. Thawing permafrost can foster chemical weathering of minerals, microbial reduction of soil iron, and groundwater transport of metals to streams. Compared to clear reference streams, orange streams have lower pH, higher turbidity, and higher sulfate, iron, and trace metal concentrations, supporting sulfide mineral weathering as a primary mobilization process. Stream discoloration was associated with dramatic declines in macroinvertebrate diversity and fish abundance. These findings have considerable implications for drinking water supplies and subsistence fisheries in rural Alaska.",

    "abstract": "Microinfarcts and microhemorrhages are characteristic lesions of cerebrovascular disease. Although multiple studies have been published, there is no one universal standard criteria for the neuropathological assessment of cerebrovascular disease. In this study, we propose a novel application of machine learning in the automated screening of microinfarcts and microhemorrhages. Utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) from postmortem human brain samples, we adapted a patch-based pipeline with convolutional neural networks. Our cohort consisted of 22 cases from the University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain bank with hematoxylin and eosin-stained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections across 3 anatomical areas: frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes (40 WSIs with microinfarcts and/or microhemorrhages, 26 without). We propose a multiple field-of-view prediction step to mitigate false positives. We report screening performance (ie, the ability to distinguish microinfarct/microhemorrhage-positive from microinfarct/microhemorrhage-negative WSIs), and detection performance (ie, the ability to localize the affected regions within a WSI). Our proposed approach improved detection precision and screening accuracy by reducing false positives thereby achieving 100% screening accuracy. Although this sample size is small, this pipeline provides a proof-of-concept for high efficacy in screening for characteristic brain changes of cerebrovascular disease to aid in screening of microinfarcts/microhemorrhages at the WSI level.",

We sought to explore the effects of obesity and sex on the brain metabolome.

The metabolic profiles of ob/ob and wild-type mice differed in both sexes. There were more obesity-altered brain metabolites in males than females. Thirty-nine metabolites were unique to males, 15 were unique to females, and five were common to both sexes. Two of the common metabolites were involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide homeostasis. A key feature of the metabolites identified in males was an increase in free fatty acids. In females, a unique feature was the presence of the neuro-modulatory metabolites 2-linoleoyl glycerol and taurine. The behavioral effects of obesity were only seen in females. These results demonstrate that most impacts of obesity on the brain metabolomic profile are sex-specific. Our work has implications for understanding the role of obesity in brain metabolism and the differential contribution of obesity to cognitive decline in males and females.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) leads to the development of cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairment, and dementia. There are sex differences in the presentation of T2DM and its associated complications. We sought to determine the impact of sex and T2DM on the brain metabolome to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of T2DM-associated cognitive complications. Untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, on whole brain tissue from adult male and female db/db mice (a T2DM model) compared to wild-type (WT) C57Bl6/J mice. Regardless of sex, T2DM increased free fatty acids and decreased acylcarnitines in the brain. Sex impacted the number (103 versus 65 in males and females, respectively), and types of metabolites shifted by T2DM. Many choline-containing phospholipids were decreased by T2DM in males. Female-specific T2DM effects included changes in neuromodulatory metabolites (γ-aminobutyric acid, 2-linoleoyl glycerol, N-methylaspartic acid, and taurine). Further, there were more significantly different metabolites between sexes in the T2DM condition as compared to the WT controls (54 vs. 15 in T2DM and WT, respectively). T2DM alters the murine brain metabolome in both sex-independent and sex-dependent manners. This work extends our understanding of brain metabolic sex differences in T2DM, cognitive implications, and potential sex-specific metabolic therapeutic targets.",

Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the profile of 53 free oxylipins in the brain. More oxylipins were modified by the inhibitor in males than in females (19 versus 3, respectively) and favored a more neuroprotective profile. Most were downstream of lipoxygenase and cytochrome p450 in males, and cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase in females. The inhibitor-associated oxylipin changes were unrelated to serum insulin, glucose, cholesterol, or female estrous cycle. The inhibitor affected behavior and cognitive function as measured by open field and Y-maze tests in males, but not females. These findings are novel and important to our understanding of sexual dimorphism in the brain's response to sEHI and may help inform sex-specific treatment targets.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxylipins have been implicated in many biological processes and diseases. Dysregulation of cerebral lipid homeostasis and altered lipid metabolites have been associated with the onset and progression of dementia. Although most dietary interventions have focused on modulation of dietary fats, the impact of a high sucrose diet on the brain oxylipin profile is unknown. METHODS: Male and female C57BL/6J mice were fed a high sucrose diet (HSD, 34%) in comparison to a control low sucrose diet (LSD, 12%) for 12 weeks beginning at 20 weeks of age. The profile of 53 free oxylipins was then measured in brain by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Serum glucose and insulin were measured enzymatically. We first assessed whether there were any effects of the diet on the brain oxylipin profile, then assessed for sex differences. RESULTS: There were no differences in fasting serum glucose between the sexes for mice fed a HSD or in fasting serum insulin levels for mice on either diet. The HSD altered the brain oxylipin profile in both sexes in distinctly different patterns: there was a reduction in three oxylipins (by 47-61%) and an increase in one oxylipin (16%) all downstream of lipoxygenase enzymes in males and a reduction in eight oxylipins (by 14-94%) mostly downstream of cyclooxygenase activity in females. 9-oxo-ODE and 6-trans-LTB4 were most influential in the separation of the oxylipin profiles by diet in male mice, whereas 5-HEPE and 12-HEPE were most influential in the separation by diet in female mice. Oxylipins 9‑hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), 11-HETE, and 15-HETE were higher in the brains of females, regardless of diet. CONCLUSION: A HSD substantially changes brain oxylipins in a distinctly sexually dimorphic manner. Results are discussed in terms of potential mechanisms and links to metabolic disease. Sex and diet effects on brain oxylipin composition may provide future targets for the management of neuroinflammatory diseases, such as dementia.",

The objective of this case report was to highlight the importance of transrectal ultrasound screening examination and to report a unique case of fetal congenital cataracts associated with other feto-placental abnormalities in a mule pregnancy, its in utero ultrasound diagnosis and outcome. A 17-year-old Thoroughbred research mare carrying a mule fetus was examined by transrectal ultrasonography at 186 days of gestation for a routine pregnancy examination. Ultrasonography allowed in utero diagnosis of fetal congenital cataracts, hyperechogenic bowels, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), hydramnios and placental abnormalities. The mare was monitored bi-monthly to observe the progress of the pregnancy. At 258 days of gestation, the abnormal chorioallantois detached at the cervical star and at 272 days, fetal asystole was diagnosed. Abortion was induced and the fetus was delivered uneventfully. Post-mortem gross and histologic findings confirmed the prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis. This case highlights the diagnostic value of a complete fetal ultrasound examination to detect equine fetal abnormalities.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of the TVA procedure on blood and peritoneal parameters, and to investigate the association of these findings with variables such as use of antibiotics, number of ovarian punctures, and length of the procedure. Physical examination was performed and blood and peritoneal fluid were obtained from 14 mares before they underwent TVA and the same parameters were assessed 24 hours after the procedure. On examination, 13/14 mares remained clinically healthy after the procedure. One mare developed low-grade fever, transient anorexia and mild colic that resolved within 12 hours post-TVA. The use of antibiotics, length of procedure and number of ovarian punctures did not have an effect on the measured parameters. All the mares presented significant changes in the leukogram, but these mostly remained within normal reference range values. The peritoneal parameters were also consistently affected after TVA. A significant post-TVA increase in lactate, total protein, and peritoneal neutrophil count was observed in peritoneal fluid. Peritoneal lactate level was elevated above baseline physiological levels in more than 50% of the mares. Results from this study indicate that there is an expected degree of inflammation after TVA procedures and peritoneal fluid parameters could be successfully used to monitor inflammation in the early stages.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe uterine prolapse, predispositions, and outcomes in mares treated between 1988 and 2019. ANIMALS: 24 mares with uterine prolapse. PROCEDURES: Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed, and follow-up information was gathered. The Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher exact test were used to analyze results for history and outcome variables for potential association with mare survival to hospital discharge. The χ2 test was used to compare breed distribution. RESULTS: Age was known in 23 mares (median, 11.1 years). For 15 mares with exact known parity, the median parity was 3 births (range, 1 to 13 births). For 22 mares, the maiden status was known (7 [32%] maiden; 15 [68%] multiparous). Breed distribution differed significantly between mares with uterine prolapse and all mares treated at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital. Arabians were overrepresented in the uterine prolapse group (7/24 [29%]), compared with all mares treated (4,174/44,474 [9%]). Uterine prolapse occurred within 2 hours after parturition for 10 of 11 mares with known foaling times, after dystocia for 7 mares, and after abortion for 4 mares. Seventeen of 23 (74%) mares survived to hospital discharge. Acute hemorrhage was the most frequent cause of death. There were no correlations between mare survival to hospital discharge and mare parity or age, foal sex, retained fetal membranes, sepsis, or maiden status. Colts were overrepresented in foals with a known sex (12/17). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated a breed predisposition to uterine prolapse, with Arabian mares overrepresented among affected mares. No characteristics correlated with mare survival to hospital discharge.",

    "issued": "2021-01",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Granulosa cell tumours (GCT) are the most common ovarian tumours in mares. While the classical presentation may not represent diagnostic challenges, diagnosis is not easy in the early stages. OBJECTIVES: Illustrate the variability in the presentation and serum biomarkers associated with ovarian abnormalities in the mare. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Nonclassical cases of GCTs and other ovarian conditions were identified and behaviour, GCT endocrine results, palpation and ultrasonographic findings are described and the diagnostic value of each is discussed. RESULTS: Mares in this case series with GCTs had been presenting clinical signs ranging from no behavioural changes to behaviours including aggression, stallion-like and inability to work under saddle. Hormonal profiles of endocrinologically functional GCTs can be erratic and unpredictable. The clinical form and ultrasonographic appearance may also vary with time from an initially enlarged/anovulatory follicular structure that later develops a multicystic 'honeycomb' appearance. Mares with GCTs can also present with persistent anovulatory follicles or apparent luteal tissue that are unresponsive to treatment. If both ovaries are of relatively normal size and symmetry, but hormonal biomarkers are markedly increased (AMH >10 ng/mL, inhibin B and/or testosterone >100 pg/mL; 0.37 nmol/L), it is likely that a functional GCT is present. Still, it can be a challenge to decide which ovary to remove. Post-surgical endocrine testing can be helpful, especially if histopathology is not performed or a GCT is not found. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Cases limited to 14. CONCLUSIONS: Granulosa cell tumours present with a wide variety of clinical signs that do not fit what is commonly described as 'classic'. Only if AMH, testosterone and inhibin B concentrations are markedly increased, and there is an abnormally enlarged ovary, the diagnosis of a GCT is more confident. In the presence of normal size ovaries, normal hormonal biomarkers and abnormal behaviour, it is more likely that the ovaries are not involved.",

By building on the UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) from its initial NIH funding in 2006, we created an institution-wide K scholar resource. We investigated subsequent NIH funding for K scholars and to what extent CTSC research resources were used. Using NIH RePORTER, we created a database of UC Davis investigators who obtained K01, K08, K23, K25, or K99, as well as institutional KL2 or K12 awards and tracked CTSC research resource use and subsequent funding success. Overall, 94 scholars completed K training between 2007 and 2020, of which 70 participated in one of four institutional, NIH-funded K programs. An additional 103 scholars completed a mentored clinical research training program. Of 94 K awardees, 61 (65%) later achieved NIH funding, with the majority receiving a subsequent individual K award. A higher proportion (73%) of funded scholars used CTSC resources compared to unfunded (48%). Biostatistics and Biomedical Informatics were most commonly used and 55% of scholars used one or more CTSC resource. We conclude that institutional commitment to create a K scholar platform and use of CTSC research resources is associated with high NIH funding rates for early career investigators.",

However, the relationship between OxPL, Lp(a), and genetic and biological characteristics remains poorly understood. We assessed the relationship between Lp(a)-bound OxPL, apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) size, age, and family structure in 2 racial groups. Methods and Results Healthy Black and White families were recruited from the general population (age: 6-74 years, n=267).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between PCSK9, Lp(a) level, apo(a) size, age, and ethnicity/race. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: General population. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy African Americans and Caucasians (n = 267); age range: 6 to 74 years. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PCSK9 levels, apo(a) isoform and LPA allele sizes, and isoform-specific Lp(a) levels. RESULTS: Plasma PCSK9 levels were significantly higher in African Americans vs Caucasians, in females vs males, and in adults vs children. PCSK9 levels were not associated with total plasma Lp(a) levels either in all participants or in ethnicity-specific analyses. However, PCSK9 levels were significantly positively associated with isoform-specific Lp(a) levels carried by the larger apo(a) size in all participants (r = 0.139, P = 0.0361).

In contrast, there were no significant associations of PCSK9 with isoform-specific Lp(a) levels for the smaller apo(a) sizes in all participants nor in ethnic-specific analyses. Furthermore, heritability (h2) analyses revealed a significant heritability for PCSK9 level in both ethnic groups, with a higher estimate in Caucasians than in African Americans (47% vs 22%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among African Americans, but not Caucasians, PCSK9 levels were associated with isoform-specific Lp(a) levels carried on larger, but not smaller, apo(a) sizes. The findings illustrate a diverging relationship of PCSK9 with isoform-specific Lp(a) levels across ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "Heritability of LPA allele, apo(a) isoform sizes, and isoform-associated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels was studied in 82 Caucasian and African-American families with two parents and two children (age: 6-74 years). We determined: 1) Lp(a) levels; 2) LPA allele sizes; 3) apo(a) isoform sizes; and 4) isoform-specific apo(a) levels (ISLs), the amount of Lp(a) carried by an individual apo(a) isoform. Trait heritability was estimated by mid-parent-offspring analysis. The ethnicity-adjusted heritability estimate for Lp(a) level was 0.95. Heritability for ISLs corresponding to the smaller LPA allele in a given allele-pair was higher than that corresponding to the larger LPA allele (0.91 vs. 0.59, P = 0.017). Although not statistically different, heritability for both apo(a) isoforms (0.90 vs. 0.70) and LPA alleles (0.98 vs. 0.82) was higher for the smaller versus larger sizes. Heritability was generally lower in African-Americans versus Caucasians with a 4-fold difference for the larger LPA allele (0.25 vs. 0.94, P = 0.001). In Caucasians, an overall higher heritability pattern was noted for the older (≥47 years) versus younger (<47 years) families. In conclusion, Lp(a) level and traits associated with the smaller LPA alleles were strongly determined by genetics, although with a varying ethnic influence. Ethnic differences in heritability of the larger LPA allele warrant further investigations.",

We describe two extensions of our previous work that combine SA-CASSCF with AMOEBA water models, allowing it to be generalized to AMOEBA models for proteins and other macromolecules. First, we discuss how our QM/MM model accounts for the discrepancy between the direct and polarization electric fields that arises in the AMOEBA description of intramolecular polarization. A second improvement is the incorporation of link atom schemes to treat instances in which the QM/MM boundary goes through covalent bonds. A single-link atom scheme and double-link atom scheme are considered in this work, and we will discuss how electrostatic interaction, van der Waals interaction, and various kinds of valence terms are treated across the boundary. To test the accuracy of the link atom scheme, we will compare QM/MM with full QM calculations and study how the errors in ground state properties, excited state properties, and excitation energies change when tuning the parameters in the link atom scheme. We will also test the new SA-CASSCF/AMOEBA method on an elementary reaction step in NanoLuc, an artificial bioluminescence luciferase. We will show how the reaction mechanism is different when calculated in the gas phase, in polarizable continuum medium (PCM), versus in protein AMOEBA models.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a spin-free formulation of the supporting subspace factorization [C. Song and T. J. Martínez, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 044108 (2018)], enabling a reduction in the computational scaling of the extended multi-state complete active space second-order perturbation (XMS-CASPT2) method for arbitrary spins. Compared to the original formulation that is defined in the spin orbitals and is limited to singlet states, the spin-free formulation in this work treats different spin states equivalently, thus naturally generalizing the idea beyond singlet states. In addition, we will present a new way of deriving the supporting subspace factorization with the purpose of understanding its physical interpretation. In this new derivation, we separate the sources that make CASPT2 difficult into the \"same-site interactions\" and \"inter-site interactions.\" We will first show how the Kronecker sum can be used to remove the same-site interactions in the absence of inter-site interactions, leading to MP2 energy in dressed orbitals. We will then show how the inter-site interactions can be exactly recovered using Löwdin partition, where the supporting subspace concept will naturally arise. The new spin-free formulation maintains the main advantage of the supporting subspace factorization, i.e., allowing XMS-CASPT2 energies to be computed using highly optimized MP2 energy codes and Fock build codes, thus reducing the scaling of XMS-CASPT2 to the same scaling as MP2. We will present and discuss results that benchmark the accuracy and performance of the new method. To demonstrate how the new method can be useful in studying real photochemical systems, the supporting subspace XMS-CASPT2 is applied to a photoreaction sensitive to magnetic field effects. The new spin-free formulation makes it possible to calculate the doublet and quartet states required in this particular photoreaction mechanism.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field (SA-CASSCF) in the atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular application (AMOEBA) polarizable water model, which enables rigorous simulation of non-adiabatic molecular dynamics with nonequilibrium solvation effects. The molecular orbital and configuration interaction coefficients of the solute wavefunction, and the induced dipoles on solvent atoms, are solved by minimizing the state averaged energy variationally. In particular, by formulating AMOEBA water models and the polarizable continuum model (PCM) in a unified way, the algorithms developed for computing SA-CASSCF/PCM energies, analytical gradients, and non-adiabatic couplings in our previous work can be generalized to SA-CASSCF/AMOEBA by properly substituting a specific list of variables. Implementation of this method will be discussed with the emphasis on how the calculations of different terms are partitioned between the quantum chemistry and molecular mechanics codes. We will present and discuss results that demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the implementation. Next, we will discuss results that compare three solvent models that work with SA-CASSCF, i.e., PCM, fixed-charge force fields, and the newly implemented AMOEBA. Finally, the new SA-CASSCF/AMOEBA method has been interfaced with the ab initio multiple spawning method to carry out non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. This method is demonstrated by simulating the photodynamics of the model retinal protonated Schiff base molecule in water.",

The wavefunctions of the solute and the PCM surface charges of the solvent are optimized simultaneously such that the state-averaged free energy is variationally minimized. The method supports both fixed weights and dynamic weights where the weights are automatically adjusted based on the energy gaps. The corresponding analytical nuclear gradients and non-adiabatic couplings are also derived. Furthermore, we show how the new method can be entirely formulated in terms of seven basic operations, which allows the implementation to benefit from existing high-performance libraries on graphical processing units. Results demonstrating the accuracy and performance of the implementation are presented and discussed. We also apply the new method to the study of minimal conical intersection search and photoreaction energy pathways in solvents.

    "abstract": "Two separate narratives have emerged in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. One interpretation speaks of private financial excess and the key role of the banking system in leveraging and deleveraging the economy. The other emphasizes the public sector balance sheet and worries about the risks of lax fiscal policy. However, the two may interact in important and understudied ways. This paper examines the co-evolution of public and private sector debt in advanced countries from 1870 to 2012. We find that in advanced economies financial crises are not preceded by public debt build-ups nor are they more likely when public debt is high. However, history shows that high levels of public debt tend to exacerbate the effects of private sector deleveraging after financial crises. The economic costs of financial crises rise substantially if large private sector credit booms are unwound at times when the public sector has little capacity to pursue macroeconomic and financial stabilization.",

    "abstract": "The L-type Ca2+ channel (CaV1.2) is essential for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. To contribute to the inward Ca2+ flux that drives Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release, CaV1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune CaV1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca2+ channel trafficking in nonmyocytes; however, whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including NaV1.5 and the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac CaV1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, superresolution imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with CaV1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/CaV1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated CaV1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs CaV1.2 superclustering. Isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal CaV1.2 expression, Ca2+ currents, and Ca2+ transients in ventricular myocytes were strengthened by 14-3-3 overexpression and attenuated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during β-adrenergic stimulation.",

    "abstract": "KvS proteins are voltage-gated potassium channel subunits that form functional channels when assembled into heteromers with Kv2.1 (KCNB1) or Kv2.2 (KCNB2). Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (KCNF1), Kv6.1 (KCNG1), Kv6.2 (KCNG2), Kv6.3 (KCNG3), Kv6.4 (KCNG4), Kv8.1 (KCNV1), Kv8.2 (KCNV2), Kv9.1 (KCNS1), Kv9.2 (KCNS2), and Kv9.3 (KCNS3). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin proteasome activity is suppressed in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells, and the heat shock protein 70/STIP1 homology and U-box-containing protein 1 (HSP70/STUB1) machinery are involved in androgen receptor (AR) and AR variant protein stabilization. Targeting HSP70 could be a viable strategy to overcome resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we showed that a novel HSP70 allosteric inhibitor, JG98, significantly suppressed drug-resistant C4-2B MDVR and CWR22Rv1 cell growth, and enhanced enzalutamide treatment. JG98 also suppressed cell growth in conditional reprogramed cell cultures (CRCs) and organoids derived from advanced prostate cancer patient samples. Mechanistically, JG98 degraded AR/AR-V7 expression in resistant cells and promoted STUB1 nuclear translocation to bind AR-V7. Knockdown of the E3 ligase STUB1 significantly diminished the anticancer effects and partially restored AR-V7 inhibitory effects of JG98. JG231, a more potent analog developed from JG98, effectively suppressed the growth of the drug-resistant prostate cancer cells, CRCs, and organoids. Notably, the combination of JG231 and enzalutamide synergistically inhibited AR/AR-V7 expression and suppressed CWR22Rv1 xenograft tumor growth. Inhibition of HSP70 using novel small-molecule inhibitors coordinates with STUB1 to regulate AR/AR-V7 protein stabilization and ARSI resistance.",

    "abstract": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the main driving force of mortality in prostate cancer patients. Among the parameters contributing to the progression of CRPC and treatment failure, elevation of the steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 and androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) are frequently reported. The AKR1C3/AR-V7 complex has been recognized as a major driver for drug resistance in advanced prostate cancer. Herein we report that the level of AKR1C3 is reciprocally regulated by the full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) through binding to the distal enhancer region of the AKR1C3 gene. A novel function of PTUPB in AKR1C3 inhibition was discovered and PTUPB showed more effectiveness than indomethacin and celecoxib in suppressing AKR1C3 activity and CRPC cell growth. PTUPB synergizes with enzalutamide treatment in tumor suppression and gene signature regulation. Combination treatments with PTUPB and enzalutamide provide benefits by blocking AR/AR-V7 signaling, which inhibits the growth of castration relapsed VCaP xenograft tumors and patient-derived xenograft organoids. Targeting of the ARK1C3/AR/AR-V7 axis with PTUPB and enzalutamide may overcome drug resistance to AR signaling inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer.",

    "issued": "2022",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) after androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapies is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer with an unfavorable prognosis. The underlying mechanisms for early neuroendocrine differentiation are poorly defined and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are needed. METHODS: We performed transcriptomic analysis on the enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell line C4-2B MDVR and NEPC patient databases to identify neural lineage signature (NLS) genes. Correlation of NLS genes with clinicopathologic features was determined. Cell viability was determined in C4-2B MDVR and H660 cells after knocking down ARHGEF2 using siRNA. Organoid viability of patient-derived xenografts was measured after knocking down ARHGEF2. RESULTS: We identify a 95-gene NLS representing the molecular landscape of neural precursor cell proliferation, embryonic stem cell pluripotency, and neural stem cell differentiation, which may indicate an early or intermediate stage of neuroendocrine differentiation. These NLS genes positively correlate with conventional neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin and synaptophysin, and negatively correlate with AR and AR target genes in advanced prostate cancer. Differentially expressed NLS genes stratify small-cell NEPC from prostate adenocarcinoma, which are closely associated with clinicopathologic features such as Gleason Score and metastasis status. Higher ARGHEF2, LHX2, and EPHB2 levels among the 95 NLS genes correlate with a shortened survival time in NEPC patients. Furthermore, downregulation of ARHGEF2 gene expression suppresses cell viability and markers of neuroendocrine differentiation in enzalutamide-resistant and neuroendocrine cells. CONCLUSIONS: The 95 neural lineage gene signatures capture an early molecular shift toward neuroendocrine differentiation, which could stratify advanced prostate cancer patients to optimize clinical treatment and serve as a source of potential therapeutic targets in advanced prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "The next-generation antiandrogen drugs such as enzalutamide and abiraterone extend survival times and improve quality of life in patients with advanced prostate cancer. However, resistance to both drugs occurs frequently through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Wnt signaling, particularly through Wnt5a, plays vital roles in promoting prostate cancer progression and induction of resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. Development of novel strategies targeting Wnt5a to overcome resistance is an urgent need. In this study, we demonstrated that Wnt5a/FZD2-mediated noncanonical Wnt pathway is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. In patient databases, both the levels of Wnt5a and FZD2 expression are upregulated upon the development of enzalutamide resistance and correlate with higher Gleason score, biochemical recurrence, and metastatic status, and with shortened disease-free survival duration. Blocking Wnt5a/FZD2 signal transduction not only diminished the activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, but also suppressed the constitutively activated androgen receptor (AR) and AR variants. Furthermore, we developed a novel bioengineered BERA-Wnt5a siRNA construct and demonstrated that inhibition of Wnt5a expression by the BERA-Wnt5a siRNA significantly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced enzalutamide treatment in vivo. These results indicate that Wnt5a/FZD2 signal pathway plays a critical role in promoting enzalutamide resistance, and targeting this pathway by BERA-Wnt5a siRNA can be developed as a potential therapy to treat advanced prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in men. Initially, it is androgen-dependent, but it eventually develops into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is incurable with current androgen receptor signaling target therapy and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy, specifically with immune checkpoint inhibitors, has brought hope for the treatment of this type of prostate cancer. Approaches such as vaccines, adoptive chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cells, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been employed to activate innate and adaptive immune responses to treat prostate cancer, but with limited success. Only Sipuleucel-T and the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab are approved by the US FDA for the treatment of limited prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer has a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) in which various immunosuppressive molecules and mechanisms coexist and interact. Additionally, prostate cancer is considered a \"cold\" tumor with low levels of tumor mutational burden, low amounts of antigen-presenting and cytotoxic T-cell activation, and high levels of immunosuppressive molecules including cytokines/chemokines. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of immunosuppressive signaling activation and immune evasion will help develop more effective treatments for prostate cancer. The purpose of this review is to summarize emerging advances in prostate cancer immunotherapy, with a particular focus on the molecular mechanisms that lead to immune evasion in prostate cancer. At the same time, we also highlight some potential therapeutic targets to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Sjogren's disease, well-described in people, is rarely identified in veterinary species. In people, Sjogren's disease is one of the most common systemic autoimmune disorders with an incidence of 0.5% in the female population. The hallmark histopathologic finding of primary Sjogren's disease is lymphomononuclear cell infiltrates aggregating as periductal infiltrate in salivary glands. Sjogren's-like disease has been reported in a domestic shorthair cat and golden retriever dog. However, both lacked positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers and the dog showed no clinical evidence of dry eye disease. The following case report describes the clinical and immunohistochemical findings suggestive of Sjogren's disease in a 3-year-old spayed female German shepherd cross that was presented for medically refractory absolute dry eye, xerostomia confirmed with oral atropine response tests, and bilateral mandibular salivary gland enlargement. Routine topical lacrostimulants, anti-inflammatories, heterologous serum, ocular lubrication, and oral pilocarpine failed to improve clinical signs or tear production. The ANA titer at 1:160 was interpreted as positive, while the complete blood count and serum biochemistry panels were unremarkable. Head and neck ultrasound revealed bilateral moderately enlarged mandibular salivary glands with a hypoechoic, mottled echotexture consistent with sialoadenitis and regional lymphadenomegaly; thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasonography were normal. In vivo confocal microscopy and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the cornea confirmed lipid keratopathy presumably secondary to corneal desiccation and steroid administration. Salivary gland histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses supported an immune-mediated etiology. Approximately 60% of the salivary section contained inflammatory cells replacing the glandular structures with a focus score of 12. Immunohistochemical markers CD3, CD204, CD79a, and CD20 were evaluated. The inflammatory infiltrate was a mixture of T-cells and macrophages with rare individual immunoreactive B-cells. CD3 and CD4+ T-cells were confirmed using immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR, respectively. Clinical signs including ocular discharge and mandibular salivary gland enlargement markedly improved following oral immunomodulatory therapy with prednisone (1 mg/kg/d, tapered over 2 months) and long-term leflunomide (2 mg/kg/d). Ocular discomfort improved dramatically decreasing the need for topical lubricants; however, tear production failed to improve likely due to extensive lacrimal gland atrophy. The aim of this report is to increase awareness of Sjogren's disease in dogs and interpret the pathology involved.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of vasodilator administration on CT angiography (CTA) prostatic artery diameter and peak opacification in dogs with prostatic carcinoma prior to prostatic artery embolization (PAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective clinical trial was performed. Ten dogs with naturally occurring prostatic carcinoma and no evidence of cardiovascular disease were enrolled. Each dog underwent multiphase CTA of the prostate before and after IV vasodilator (glyceryl trinitrate [GTN] or clevidipine butyrate [clevidipine]) administration, and cardiovascular parameters were monitored. PAE was performed the following day. Prostatic arterial anatomy was characterized by CTA. Prostatic artery lumen diameter and peak opacification were measured on pre- and post-vasodilator CTA by a blinded radiologist. The percent change of these measurements was calculated and assessed for significance. RESULTS: Glyceryl trinitrate and clevidipine were administered in 5 dogs each with subsequent blood pressure reduction documented in all dogs. No significant difference was detected in prostatic artery diameter or peak opacification between pre- vs. post-vasodilator CTA. Good agreement in prostatic arterial branch number, origin, and course was documented between pre- and post-vasodilator CTA images. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Study findings do not support the routine use of vasodilator administration during pre-PAE CTA in dogs, though larger sample sizes and protocol alterations may be needed to detect a clinically relevant utility.",

    "issued": "2024-04",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic cells capable of recognizing heterogeneous cancer targets without prior sensitization, making them promising prospects for use in cellular immunotherapy. Companion dogs develop spontaneous cancers in the context of an intact immune system, representing a valid cancer immunotherapy model. Previously, CD5 depletion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was used in dogs to isolate a CD5dim-expressing NK subset prior to co-culture with an irradiated feeder line, but this can limit the yield of the final NK product. This study aimed to assess NK activation, expansion, and preliminary clinical activity in first-in-dog clinical trials using a novel system with unmanipulated PBMCs to generate our NK cell product. METHODS: Starting populations of CD5-depleted cells and PBMCs from healthy beagle donors were co-cultured for 14 days, phenotype, cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion were measured, and samples were sequenced using the 3'-Tag-RNA-Seq protocol. Co-cultured human PBMCs and NK-isolated cells were also sequenced for comparative analysis. In addition, two first-in-dog clinical trials were performed in dogs with melanoma and osteosarcoma using autologous and allogeneic NK cells, respectively, to establish safety and proof-of-concept of this manufacturing approach. RESULTS: Calculated cell counts, viability, killing, and cytokine secretion were equivalent or higher in expanded NK cells from canine PBMCs versus CD5-depleted cells, and immune phenotyping confirmed a CD3-NKp46+ product from PBMC-expanded cells at day 14. Transcriptomic analysis of expanded cell populations confirmed upregulation of NK activation genes and related pathways, and human NK cells using well-characterized NK markers closely mirrored canine gene expression patterns. Autologous and allogeneic PBMC-derived NK cells were successfully expanded for use in first-in-dog clinical trials, resulting in no serious adverse events and preliminary efficacy data. RNA sequencing of PBMCs from dogs receiving allogeneic NK transfer showed patient-unique gene signatures with NK gene expression trends in response to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the use of unmanipulated PBMCs appears safe and potentially effective for canine NK immunotherapy with equivalent to superior results to CD5 depletion in NK expansion, activation, and cytotoxicity. Our preclinical and clinical data support further evaluation of this technique as a novel platform for optimizing NK immunotherapy in dogs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphoplasmacytic enteritis (LPE) and low-grade intestinal T cell lymphoma (LGITL) are common diseases in older cats, but their diagnosis and differentiation remain challenging. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the current literature on etiopathogenesis and diagnosis of LPE and LGITL in cats and provide guidance on the differentiation between LPE and LGITL in cats. To provide statements established using evidence-based approaches or where such evidence is lacking, statements based on consensus of experts in the field. ANIMALS: None. METHODS: A panel of 6 experts in the field (2 internists, 1 radiologist, 1 anatomic pathologist, 1 clonality expert, 1 oncologist) with the support of a human medical immunologist, was formed to assess and summarize evidence in the peer-reviewed literature and complement it with consensus recommendations. RESULTS: Despite increasing interest on the topic for clinicians and pathologists, few prospective studies were available, and interpretation of the pertinent literature often was challenging because of the heterogeneity of the cases. Most recommendations by the panel were supported by a moderate or low level of evidence. Several understudied areas were identified, including cellular markers using immunohistochemistry, genomics, and transcriptomic studies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: To date, no single diagnostic criterion or known biomarker reliably differentiates inflammatory lesions from neoplastic lymphoproliferations in the intestinal tract of cats and a diagnosis currently is established by integrating all available clinical and diagnostic data. Histopathology remains the mainstay to better differentiate LPE from LGITL in cats with chronic enteropathy.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if computed tomographic lymphangiography (CTL) after ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of intrahepatic iopamidol (Isovue 370) in healthy cats would safely and effectively lead to opacification of the hepatic lymphatics, cisterna chyli, and thoracic ducts (TDs). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective pilot study design with randomization of the sides of the liver injected. SAMPLE POPULATION: 6 purpose-bred cats. PROCEDURES: Cats were anesthetized and based on random assignment, and the left or right liver was injected with iodinated contrast material. CTL images were taken at 5, 10, and 15 minutes postinjection to determine the quality of opacification of the cisterna chyli and TDs. RESULTS: Eleven hepatic injections from 6 cats were available for review. One CT file was corrupted and unusable. Seven out of 11 hepatic contrast injections yielded a diagnostic study. Five out of 11 were graded as excellent, 0/11 were graded as good, and 2/11 were graded as fair. Opacification of the cisterna chyli and TDs was absent in 4/11 studies. Three out of 6 cats had mild to moderate increases in hepatocellular enzymes when assayed 3 months postprocedure. The hepatic lymphatics, cisterna chyli, and TDs were opacified in all studies deemed diagnostic. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Intrahepatic contrast injection offers a novel portal for thoracic duct lymphangiography that documents the hepatic contribution to the mesenteric lymphatics, cisterna chyli, and thoracic duct. The procedure may be helpful in the preoperative diagnostic evaluation of cats with chylothorax.",

The horse had a one-week history of weight loss and weakness before becoming recumbent and dying. Grossly, the liver had rounded edges and was mottled. There were ecchymoses on the gastric serosa, and a large amount of mucoid, pale, green-to-yellow content adhered to the mucosa of the small and large intestines. Microscopically, random areas in the liver were necrotic and infiltrated by large numbers of neutrophils, and fewer lymphocytes and plasma cells. Other changes in the liver included neutrophilic cholangitis with bile duct hyperplasia in portal areas, canalicular cholestasis, and mild portal fibrosis. The lamina propria, and occasionally the submucosa, of the small intestine and colon was infiltrated by large numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and there was multifocal crypt necrosis. C. jejuni was recovered in pure culture from the liver.",

    "abstract": "Transmissible viral proventriculitis (TVP) and chicken proventricular necrosis virus (CPNV) affect the broiler industry globally and are emerging diseases of economic importance. Here, we present the findings of TVP from processed broiler carcasses in Argentina following marked condemnation at the processing plant. We studied a total of 122 abnormally presenting proventriculi at processing from 42-to-50-day-old, male Cobb500™ broiler chicken carcasses from 11 farms belonging to the same company in 13 episodes of proventriculi-gizzards condemnation between December 2021 and April 2022. The proventriculi were enlarged and pale with a widened gastric isthmus. A histopathologic lesion score system was developed based on the presence of a combination of key microscopic findings, the distribution, and the severity of the lesions. Scoring of the affected proventriculi revealed 65% (79/122) with a score of 4, 23% (28/122) with a score of 3, and 12% (15/122) with a score of 2. Focal to multifocal immunoreactivity against the VP2-CPNV antigen within the necrotic glandular epithelial cells was noted in the affected proventriculi using immunohistochemistry. We found 84.4% (103/122) of the studied proventriculi with TVP lesions grossly and microscopically scored were positive for CPNV by RT-PCR. The sequencing results of the PCR product showed a high nucleotide sequence similarity (88.97%) to previously published VP1-CPNV sequences. We confirmed CPNV infection in most of the TVP affected proventriculi in all condemnation episodes at a broiler chicken processing plant in Argentina during the studied period. This study documents TVP associated with CPNV detection at processing plants in Argentina for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Confirmation of extracellular amyloid deposition across various animal species and tissue types has been a long-standing challenge in veterinary diagnostic pathology. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has historically been used to advance the understanding of amyloid fibril morphology and confirm amyloid fibril deposition when histologic methods provide unclear results. We assessed the feasibility of utilizing TEM for routine confirmation of amyloidosis as an addition to histology. We analyzed ex situ amyloid fibrils with direct, negative-contrast TEM and in situ amyloid fibrils with aldehyde-fixed, plastic-embedding TEM to confirm amyloidosis in a variety of cases in which amorphous extracellular amyloid deposits had been identified by H&E and Congo red staining. We compared the 2 TEM methods and documented amyloid fibril morphology and morphometry in 7 species (goat, guinea pig, kudu, fox, sheep, flamingo, and duck). Ex situ fibrils had helical morphology and widths of 15-18 nm across all species. Fibril crossover distances had more interspecies variation of 60-130 nm, and species could be grouped based on pitch (twist size). Twisting patterns of in situ fibrils could not be visualized, but in situ widths of 10 nm were measured across all species. In 4 different chicken cases, fibrils differing morphologically from amyloid were consistently detected via both TEM methods, suggesting the possibility of a non-amyloid deposit that is commonly diagnosed as amyloidosis based on its histologic appearance. When available, we recommend routine confirmation of amyloid fibril deposition by TEM.",

Although the association between yersiniosis and reproductive complications is known, systematic studies and case series on abortion in sheep and goats are scarce. Here we describe epidemiologic and pathologic findings in 34 cases of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis- and Y. enterocolitica-associated abortions in sheep and goats, contributing to the understanding of these zoonotic diseases in California. We conducted a 22-y retrospective study to examine microbiologic and pathologic findings in abortion submissions, as well as the geographic and seasonal distribution of the analyzed cases. Yersiniosis-induced abortion was diagnosed in 22 goats and 12 sheep, with all abortions occurring in the last third of gestation. Samples from lung, liver, placenta, and abomasal contents were submitted for aerobic culture; the highest recovery of Yersinia spp. was from abomasal contents. Microscopically, there was severe necrotizing and suppurative inflammation in the lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and, when present, the placenta, with intralesional bacterial colonies. All cases were received from northern and central California in the winter and spring. Our study provides epidemiologic and pathologic features of Yersinia spp.-induced abortions in small ruminants and provides critical data to pave the way for future research, surveillance, and preventive strategies.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine if patient variables were associated with intervention in pediatric patients presenting with high-grade renal injuries. METHODS: A retrospective review of pediatric patients presenting with grade IV/V renal injury between 2003 and 2021 at a Level 1 trauma center was performed. Renal injury grade was verified and updated based upon the 2018 American Association for the Surgery of Trauma injury scale. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (median age 13 years old, IQR 9-16) with Grade IV (n = 53) or Grade V (n = 22) injury were identified. 33% (25/75) had immediate renal intervention within 24 h of admission. Of the remaining 50 children who were observed, 47 had blunt trauma, and outcomes were analyzed. The median age of observed patients was 12 years (IQR 8-14) and 30% (14/47) had intervention. Delayed images on CT showed ureteral contrast was present in 87% (41/47) of observed patients. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the presence of contrast in the ureter is associated with significantly lower odds of intervention, OR 0.06 [0-0.73, 95% CI], p = 0.03. CONCLUSION: After grades IV and V blunt renal injury, for those children who are considered safe to observe, AAST grade of injury did not associate with procedural intervention. The presence of contrast in the ureter on delayed CT imaging was associated with a significantly lower odds of procedural intervention.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe goal was to elucidate and present the current landscape of bladder biosensor technology for urinary volume monitoring in the management of neurogenic bladder. The need for such technology in managing neurogenic bladder in the pediatric population is discussed, as well as the challenges researchers currently face in advancing individual technologies.MethodsA literature review including 43 articles discussing bladder biosensor and related technology for continuous urinary volume monitoring was conducted. Articles ranged from original research studies to systematic reviews.ResultsVarious continuous bladder urine volume monitoring devices have been proposed and evaluated. These devices utilize principles of ultrasound, electrical impedance tomography, near infrared spectroscopy, pressure biosensor implantation, microwave radar, and frequency modulated continuous wave radar. While several studies have shown promise in correlating device measurements to bladder urinary volume changes, ultimately researchers have not been able to surmount the challenges of optimizing configuration of device components and the impacts of dynamic position, posture, body habitus, bladder location, and urine biochemical properties that demonstrate high interpersonal variability.ConclusionThe need for developing bladder biosensor technology to provide continuous urine volume monitoring in patients with neurogenic bladder remains great. Transitioning from a time-based clean intermittent catheterization approach to a volume-based approach would possibly improve neurogenic bladder patients' quality of life. While technologies face limitations that have stalled translation to clinical practice, there is potential to build upon past work to address current challenges and meet this ever-pressing need.",

    "issued": "2023-06",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although hypospadias outcomes studies typically report a level or type of repair performed, these studies often lack applicability to each surgical practice due to technical variability that is not fully delineated. An example is the tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty procedure, for which modifications have been associated with significantly decreased complication rates in single center series. However, many studies fail to report specificity in techniques utilized, thereby limiting comparison between series. OBJECTIVE: With the goal of developing a surgical atlas of hypospadias repair techniques, this study examined 1) current techniques used by surgeons in our network for recording operative notes and 2) operative technical details by surgeon for two common procedures, tubularized incised plate (TIP) distal and proximal hypospadias repairs across a multi-institutional surgical network. STUDY DESIGN: A two-part study was completed. First, a survey was distributed to the network to assess surgeon volume and methods of recording hypospadias repair operative notes. Subsequently, an operative template or a representative de-identified operative note describing a TIP and/or proximal repair with urethroplasty was obtained from participating surgeons. Each was analyzed by at least two individuals for natural language that signified specified portions of the procedure. Procedural details from each note were tabulated and confirmed with each surgeon, clarifying that the recorded findings reflected their current practice techniques and instrumentation. RESULTS: Twenty-five surgeons from 12 institutions completed the survey. The number of primary distal hypospadias repairs performed per surgeon in the past year ranged from 1-10 to >50, with 40% performing 1-20. Primary proximal hypospadias repairs performed in the past year ranged from 1-30, with 60% performing 1-10. 96% of surgeons maintain operative notes within an electronic health record. Of these, 66.7% edited a template as their primary method of note entry; 76.5% of these surgeons reported that the template captures their operative techniques very or moderately well. Operative notes or templates from 16 surgeons at 10 institutions were analyzed. In 7 proximal and 14 distal repairs, parameters for chordee correction, urethroplasty suture selection and technique, tissue utilized, and catheter selection varied widely across surgeons. CONCLUSION: Wide variability in technical surgical details of categorically similar hypospadias repairs was demonstrated across a large surgical network. Surgeon-specific modifications of commonly described procedures are common, and further evaluation of short- and long-term outcomes accounting for these technical variations is needed to determine their relative influence.",

    "issued": "2023-06",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is controversy surrounding the association between caudal block and complication rates after hypospadias repair. Conflicting results have been reported mostly from single-center, low volume studies and those that did not include relevant variables. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that caudal block is not associated with increased rates of reoperation after primary repair and is associated with more complex hypospadias surgery. STUDY DESIGN: The Clinical Practice Solutions Center database was queried to identify patients who received a primary hypospadias repair between 2009 and 2010. Primary hypospadias repair was further categorized as meatal advancement and glanduloplasty, distal, one-stage proximal, or one-stage perineal repair. Anesthesia coding was evaluated to identify those who received a caudal block. Any revision surgery was captured between 2009 and 2019 and the types of revision surgeries were identified. Variables such as caudal block, age, insurance type, surgeon volume, and surgeon years in practice were analyzed with mixed effects multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: The dataset query identified 3343 pediatric males who had primary hypospadias repair. The procedures were performed by 50 surgeons at 27 hospitals. Primary surgeries included meatal advancement and glanduloplasty (23%), distal (69%), proximal (6.9%), and perineal repairs (1%). Caudal block was administered to 42% of patients. Utilization of caudal block was not associated with type of primary surgery (p = 0.21). Adjusting for all other variables, increased patient age was associated with decreased usage of caudal block (p < 0.001). Analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant association between utilization of caudal block with rates of revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This large, multi-institution study demonstrates that the use of caudal block was not associated with more complex hypospadias surgery nor statistically significantly associated with increased rates of revision surgery after primary hypospadias repair.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic abdominal surgery has become a mainstay of modern surgical practice. Postoperative analgesia is an integral component of recovery following laparoscopic abdominal surgery and may be improved by regional anesthesia or intravenous lidocaine infusion. There is inconsistent evidence supporting the use of interfascial plane blocks, such as transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks, for patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery as evidenced by variable patterns of local anesthetic spread and conflicting results from studies comparing TAP blocks to local anesthetic infiltration of laparoscopic port sites and multimodal analgesia. Quadratus lumborum (QL) and erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks may provide greater areas of somatic analgesia as well as visceral analgesia, which may translate to more significant clinical benefits. Aside from the locations of the surgical incisions, it is unclear what other factors should be considered when choosing one regional technique over another or deciding to infuse lidocaine intravenously. We reviewed the current literature in attempt to clarify the roles of various regional anesthesia techniques for patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery and present one possible approach to evaluating postoperative pain.",

    "issued": "2020-12",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cataract surgery is one of the most common procedures performed worldwide in the elderly. Various medications can provide effective anesthesia and analgesia for cataract surgery, but undesirable side effects limit the utility of each medication or combination of medications. Dexmedetomidine may serve as an anesthesia adjunct for outpatient cataract surgery in the elderly. METHODS: Searches were conducted in Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed for randomized clinical trials investigating the use of dexmedetomidine in adult patients undergoing outpatient, or ambulatory, cataract surgery with sedation and topical or peribulbar block. Ninety-nine publications were identified, of which 15 trials satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 914 patients were included in this review. The following data were collected: American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) physical status and age of study patients; method of blinding and randomization; medication doses and routes of administration; and intraoperative levels of sedation. We also recorded statistically significant differences between dexmedetomidine and other study medications or placebo with respect to the following outcomes: hemodynamic and respiratory parameters; pain; sedation; post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV); discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) or recovery times; patient satisfaction; surgeon satisfaction; and effects on intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Hypotension with or without bradycardia was reported following bolus doses of dexmedetomidine ranging from 0.5-1.0 mcg/kg with or without a continuous dexmedetomidine infusion. Delayed PACU discharge times were associated with the use of dexmedetomidine, but no clear association was identified between delayed recovery and higher levels of intraoperative sedation. Better analgesia and higher patient satisfaction were commonly reported with dexmedetomidine as well as reductions in IOP. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review demonstrates better analgesia, higher patient satisfaction, and reduced IOP with dexmedetomidine for outpatient cataract surgery when compared to traditional sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids. These benefits of dexmedetomidine, however, must be weighed against relative cardiovascular depression and delayed PACU discharge or recovery times. Therefore, the utility of dexmedetomidine for outpatient cataract surgery should be considered on a patient-by-patient basis.",

    "abstract": "With the growing popularity of cold brewed coffee comes a need for brewing efficiency while preserving the desirable flavor profile. Despite the wide use of full immersion brewing techniques, the effect of brew time on the dynamic sensory profiles of full immersion brewed coffee remains underexplored. Here, we investigated the relationship between coffee sensory quality and extraction dynamics, measured as Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Extraction (E) of full immersion brewed coffee at various roast levels, and brewing temperatures (4 °C, 22 °C and 92 °C), over brew time using a generic descriptive analysis method. Specifically, different brew time points were selected for different temperatures based on five targeted coffee extraction stages. Furthermore, the unique experimental design also explored a sensory-driven engineering research process. Roast level had the greatest impact on the sensory profile of the coffees, followed by brewing temperature, but brew time, especially the longer brew times as TDS plateaued, had subtler impacts than expected. Twenty-five of 28 sensory attributes were significantly different among the 30 coffee samples, indicating a single source green coffee blend can produce a wide range of complex sensory profiles using different combinations of roast level, temperature, and brew time. Specifically, the intensity of sweetness was negatively correlated with TDS, and 19 other attribute intensities were positively correlated with TDS. Interestingly, we found that certain long time cold brews had similar sensory profiles to those of some short time hot brews, suggesting the sensory profiles of certain hot brews and cold brews could possibly be matched through controlled preparation. Overall, our study demonstrated an approach of integrating food engineering and sensory analysis for product development, and our findings provide valuable insights into the extraction dynamics and sensory quality of full immersion brewed coffee and opens new brewing avenues for the coffee industry.",

    "abstract": "Coffee professionals have long known that the \"roast profile,\" i.e., the temperature versus time inside the roaster, strongly affects the flavor and quality of the coffee. A particularly important attribute of brewed coffee is the perceived sourness, which is known to be strongly correlated to the total titratable acidity (TA). Most prior work has focused on laboratory-scale roasters with little control over the roast profile, so the relationship between roast profile in a commercial-scale roaster and the corresponding development of TA to date remains unclear. Here we investigate roast profiles of the same total duration but very different dynamics inside a 5-kg commercial drum roaster, and we show that the TA invariably peaks during first crack and then decays to its original value by second crack. Although the dynamics of the TA development varied with roast profile, the peak TA surprisingly exhibited almost no statistically significant differences among roast profiles. Our results provide insight on how to manipulate and achieve desired sourness during roasting.",

We give a mathematical derivation of the experimentally determined dependence of mean velocity on the relative amplitudes of the two frequency modes, and the phase lag between the modes, when γ=2, and when the magnitude of plate acceleration is much larger than the magnitude of acceleration by static friction. The approach uses an analysis of the symmetry properties of the roots of trigonometric polynomials, without explicit determination of those roots. The behavior when γ=1/2, and specific phase lags that inhibit net velocity for general γ, are also determined.",

The direction and velocity of the granular flow are tuned by modulating the sign and amplitude, respectively, of the vibratory waveform, with typical pumping velocities of centimeters per second. Different granular materials are mixed by combining them at Y-shaped junctions, and mixtures of granules with different friction coefficients are separated along straight channels by judicious choice of the vibratory waveform. We demonstrate that the observed velocities accord with a theory valid for sufficiently large or fast vibrations, and we discuss the implications for using vibrational manipulation in conjunction with established microfluidic technologies to combine liquid and dry solid handling operations at sub-millimeter length scales.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate clinically relevant outcomes following suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injection in eyes with noninfectious uveitis. DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. METHODS: Sixty-one eyes (51 patients) who underwent suprachoroidal TA injection between January 1, 2022 and July 1, 2024 were included from a single institution. Main outcome measures included change in central subfield thickness (CST) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6, 12, and 24 weeks in eyes with macular edema and improvement in fluorescein angiography (FA) score at 6 weeks in eyes who underwent FA. RESULTS: Fifty-two eyes underwent suprachoroidal TA injection for uveitic macular edema. Mean CST improved from 437.61 microns at time of injection to 348.17 microns 6 weeks after (mean difference 89.44 microns, p < 0.0001, n = 47). Additional treatment for macular edema was required for 17% (8/48 eyes), 48% (14/29 eyes), and 41% (9/22 eyes) of eyes that returned for follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. Of the 17 eyes that returned for follow-up at all visits (6, 12, and 24 weeks), 41.2% (7/17 eyes) did not require any additional treatment during the 24-week follow-up period. Ten eyes underwent FA at time of injection and 6 weeks later. The mean FA score improved from 11.74 to 9.14 (mean difference 2.60, p = 0.047). No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Suprachoroidal TA resulted in significant improvement in outcome measures, including central subfield thickness in eyes with macular edema, and leakage on fluorescein angiography, with a favorable side effect profile in real-world clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe the ocular pathology of a patient with fungal endophthalmitis with features mimicking sympathetic ophthalmia. METHODS: Review of medical records and histopathology of a single patient. RESULTS: A 72-year-old man who sustained penetrating injury to the left eye with an agave plant presented to our clinic 16 months after the initial injury. Before presentation, the patient had developed endophthalmitis and had undergone anterior chamber washout, vitrectomy, and intravitreal steroids, antibiotics, antifungals, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. At presentation, the patient had a blind, painful eye and subsequently underwent enucleation. Histopathology demonstrated granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells in the iris and Dalen-Fuchs nodules with CD68-positive epithelioid histiocytes associated with the retinal pigment epithelium sparing the choriocapillaris. These findings were initially attributed to sympathetic ophthalmia. The fellow eye did not have any signs of inflammation, and Grocott methenamine silver stain was positive for filamentous fungal elements, leading to a diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal endophthalmitis may develop histopathologic features that are similar to those observed in sympathetic ophthalmia. Recognition of the overlap between the histopathologic features of these diseases may reduce the possibility of misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of the fellow eye.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report our real-world experience using intravitreal faricimab, a novel anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) previously treated with other anti-VEGF therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study of previously treated nAMD eyes treated with faricimab. RESULTS: In 88 eyes (73 patients), mean baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/63 (range 20/20 to CF) with mean anti-VEGF injection interval of 6.1+2.0 weeks. Mean baseline central subfield thickness (CST) was 291+73 µm. During mean follow-up of 30.1+13.5 (range 7.0 to 50.3) weeks on faricimab, the eyes received an average of 5.1+2.4 injections (range 1 to 11). Mean BCVA remained at 20/63 (p=0.11), but injection interval increased to 7.4+2.6 weeks (p<0.001), and CST decreased to 262+63 µm (p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that higher number of different anti-VEGF drugs used at baseline was associated with a lower decrease in CST on faricimab (p=0.04) while total number of anti-VEGF injections at baseline (p=0.56) and time on faricimab (p=0.68) were not associated. Faricimab was discontinued in 23 eyes (26.1%), including 8 eyes for poor response, 2 eyes for persistent new floaters and 4 eyes for new vision decrease which reversed after stopping faricimab. CONCLUSION: In previously treated nAMD eyes, intravitreal faricimab was associated with increased mean treatment interval and decreased CST but no improvement in mean BCVA. The benefit of faricimab on CST reduction may be diminished in eyes previously treated with multiple different types of anti-VEGF therapy.",

    "abstract": "Basic sciences form the foundation of medical knowledge and practice in medical schools. Since the 1910 Flexner Report, which led to the establishment of multiple basic science departments, faculty in these departments have been responsible for preclinical courses in the first 2 years of medical education. The basic science disciplines and their associated faculty have been crucial to medical education, fostering critical thinking and preparing physicians for rapid advancements in medicine. Importantly, they have grown as engines of innovation and influence to comprise hubs for fundamental and translational research. More recently, a convergence of influences, including the adoption of integrated curricula and other changes in the traditional medical education structure, as well as financial pressures and ongoing changes in research funding, has prompted many institutions to re-evaluate the organization of basic sciences, leading to a wave of departmental consolidations. While this may seem administratively and financially attractive, it could have the unintended consequence of consolidating scientific thought, with an attendant stifling of innovation. To sustain the institutional capacity for making the paradigm-shifting discoveries essential for transforming medicine in a shifting research landscape, we propose a new rationale for maintaining or even expanding the multi-departmental structure. Our model builds on recent research suggesting that thematic diversity and inter- and trans-disciplinary teams are fundamental features crucial for innovation. We propose a novel approach that involves the establishment of an institution-wide strategic theme, layered over a multi-departmental structure in which individual department chairs are recruited based on the extent to which their research agenda aligns with the strategic theme. This broad institutional strategy preserves the unique contributions of individual disciplines while fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, thereby maximizing thematic breadth and synergy. By balancing administrative efficiency with the imperative for innovative research, medical schools can establish a unique identity with an associated future vision. Importantly, the existing strengths that foster this vision provide the basis for explosive growth, with the capacity to shape the future of medical education while creating an environment conducive to groundbreaking discoveries and advancements in medical science.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a critical cofactor essential for various cellular processes. Abnormalities in NAD+ metabolism have also been associated with a number of metabolic disorders. The regulation and interconnection of NAD+ metabolic pathways are not yet completely understood. By employing an NAD+ intermediate-specific genetic system established in the model organism S. cerevisiae, we show that histone deacetylases (HDACs) Hst1 and Rpd3 link the regulation of the de novo NAD+ metabolism-mediating BNA genes with certain aspects of the phosphate (Pi)-sensing PHO pathway. Our genetic and gene expression studies suggest that the Bas1-Pho2 and Pho2-Pho4 transcription activator complexes play a role in this co-regulation. Our results suggest a model in which competition for Pho2 usage between the BNA-activating Bas1-Pho2 complex and the PHO-activating Pho2-Pho4 complex helps balance de novo activity with PHO activity in response to NAD+ or phosphate depletion. Interestingly, both the Bas1-Pho2 and Pho2-Pho4 complexes appear to also regulate the expression of the salvage-mediating PNC1 gene negatively. These results suggest a mechanism for the inverse regulation between the NAD+ salvage pathways and the de novo pathway observed in our genetic models. Our findings help provide a molecular basis for the complex interplay of two different aspects of cellular metabolism.",

    "abstract": "NAD+ is a cellular redox cofactor involved in many essential processes. The regulation of NAD+ metabolism and the signaling networks reciprocally interacting with NAD+-producing metabolic pathways are not yet fully understood. The NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) Hst1 has been shown to inhibit de novo NAD+ synthesis by repressing biosynthesis of nicotinic acid (BNA) gene expression. Here, we alternatively identify HDAC Rpd3 as a positive regulator of de novo NAD+ metabolism in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We reveal that deletion of RPD3 causes marked decreases in the production of de novo pathway metabolites, in direct contrast to deletion of HST1. We determined the BNA expression profiles of rpd3Δ and hst1Δ cells to be similarly opposed, suggesting the two HDACs may regulate the BNA genes in an antagonistic fashion. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Rpd3 and Hst1 mutually influence each other's binding distribution at the BNA2 promoter. We demonstrate Hst1 to be the main deacetylase active at the BNA2 promoter, with hst1Δ cells displaying increased acetylation of the N-terminal tail lysine residues of histone H4, H4K5, and H4K12. Conversely, we show that deletion of RPD3 reduces the acetylation of these residues in an Hst1-dependent manner. This suggests that Rpd3 may function to oppose spreading of Hst1-dependent heterochromatin and represents a unique form of antagonism between HDACs in regulating gene expression. Moreover, we found that Rpd3 and Hst1 also coregulate additional targets involved in other branches of NAD+ metabolism. These findings help elucidate the complex interconnections involved in effecting the regulation of NAD+ metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential metabolite with wide-ranging and significant roles in the cell. Defects in NAD+ metabolism have been associated with many human disorders; it is therefore an emerging therapeutic target. Moreover, NAD+ metabolism is perturbed during colonization by a variety of pathogens, either due to the molecular mechanisms employed by these infectious agents or by the host immune response they trigger. Three main biosynthetic pathways, including the de novo and salvage pathways, contribute to the production of NAD+ with a high degree of conservation from bacteria to humans. De novo biosynthesis, which begins with l-tryptophan in eukaryotes, is also known as the kynurenine pathway. Intermediates of this pathway have various beneficial and deleterious effects on cellular health in different contexts. For example, dysregulation of this pathway is linked to neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. Activation of the de novo pathway is also implicated in various infections and inflammatory signaling. Given the dynamic flexibility and multiple roles of NAD+ intermediates, it is important to understand the interconnections and cross-regulations of NAD+ precursors and associated signaling pathways to understand how cells regulate NAD+ homeostasis in response to various growth conditions. Although regulation of NAD+ homeostasis remains incompletely understood, studies in the genetically tractable budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae may help provide some molecular basis for how NAD+ homeostasis factors contribute to the maintenance and regulation of cellular function and how they are regulated by various nutritional and stress signals. Here we present a brief overview of recent insights and discoveries made with respect to the relationship between NAD+ metabolism and selected human disorders and infections, with a particular focus on the de novo pathway. We also discuss how studies in budding yeast may help elucidate the regulation of NAD+ homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "NAD+ is an essential metabolite participating in cellular biochemical processes and signaling. The regulation and interconnection among multiple NAD+ biosynthesis pathways are incompletely understood. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells lacking the N-terminal (Nt) protein acetyltransferase complex NatB exhibit an approximate 50% reduction in NAD+ levels and aberrant metabolism of NAD+ precursors, changes that are associated with a decrease in nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) protein levels. Here, we show that this decrease in NAD+ and Nmnat protein levels is specifically due to the absence of Nt-acetylation of Nmnat (Nma1 and Nma2) proteins and not of other NatB substrates. Nt-acetylation critically regulates protein degradation by the N-end rule pathways, suggesting that the absence of Nt-acetylation may alter Nmnat protein stability. Interestingly, the rate of protein turnover (t½) of non-Nt-acetylated Nmnats did not significantly differ from those of Nt-acetylated Nmnats. Accordingly, deletion or depletion of the N-end rule pathway ubiquitin E3 ligases in NatB mutants did not restore NAD+ levels. Next, we examined whether the status of Nt-acetylation would affect the translation of Nmnats, finding that the absence of Nt-acetylation does not significantly alter the polysome formation rate on Nmnat mRNAs. However, we observed that NatB mutants have significantly reduced Nmnat protein maturation. Our findings indicate that the reduced Nmnat levels in NatB mutants are mainly due to inefficient protein maturation. Nmnat activities are essential for all NAD+ biosynthesis routes, and understanding the regulation of Nmnat protein homeostasis may improve our understanding of the molecular basis and regulation of NAD+ metabolism.",

The cellular NAD+ pool is maintained by three biosynthesis pathways, which are largely conserved from bacteria to human. NAD+ metabolism is an emerging therapeutic target for several human disorders including diabetes, cancer, and neuron degeneration. Factors regulating NAD+ homeostasis have remained incompletely understood due to the dynamic nature and complexity of NAD+ metabolism. Recent studies using the genetically tractable budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified novel NAD+ homeostasis factors. These findings help provide a molecular basis for how may NAD+ and NAD+ homeostasis factors contribute to the maintenance and regulation of cellular function. Here we summarize major NAD+ biosynthesis pathways, selected cellular processes that closely connect with and contribute to NAD+ homeostasis, and regulation of NAD+ metabolism by nutrient-sensing signaling pathways. We also extend the discussions to include possible implications of NAD+ homeostasis factors in human disorders. Understanding the cross-regulation and interconnections of NAD+ precursors and associated cellular pathways will help elucidate the mechanisms of the complex regulation of NAD+ homeostasis. These studies may also contribute to the development of effective NAD+-based therapeutic strategies specific for different types of NAD+ deficiency related disorders.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Furosemide, a commonly used diuretic, activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in other species. Little is known about RAAS peptide activation in horses. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate equilibrium analysis as a practical method for RAAS quantification in horses and describe the RAAS response to a single dose of furosemide. We hypothesize that furosemide would cause transient increase in RAAS peptides in horses. ANIMALS: 14 healthy adult thoroughbreds from a university teaching herd. METHODS: Horses received either furosemide (1 mg/kg IV) or saline IV in a crossover study design. Protease-inhibited samples were compared with equilibrium analysis samples with Deming regression analysis. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones were evaluated at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 4, and 24 hours postadministration, via equilibrium analysis. Values were compared with a mixed effects model. RESULTS: Correlation between protease inhibition and equilibrium analysis was high for angiotensin I peptide (AngI) and angiotensin II peptide (AngII) (r = .92 and .95, respectively). Baseline RAAS peptide concentrations were below the limit of detection except AngII (median, 7.5 [range, 3.5-14.0] pmol/L). Furosemide administration resulted in an increase in AngI (8.0 [0.5-15.5] pmol/L, P = .03), AngII (33.7 [9.6-57.9] pmol/L, P = .0008), angiotensin III peptide (AngIII) (2.9 [0.9-4.9] pmol/L, P = .0005), angiotensin IV peptide (AngIV) (2.0 [0.6-3.4] pmol/L, P = .0005), and angiotensin 1-5 peptide (Ang1-5) (5.6 [1.2-5.9] pmol/L, P = .003) at 4 hours. Differences are reported as difference in the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Furosemide produced an increase in hormones associated with both the classical and alternative RAAS pathways. Serum equilibrium analysis is practical for RAAS analysis in horses.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Complications are a practical consideration for elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies performed under general anaesthesia but relatively little is known about their distribution and risk factors. OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of complications associated with MRI performed under general anaesthesia at a large referral facility and evaluate potential risk factors for these complications. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. METHODS: Patient information and details of the MRI procedure were collected retrospectively from medical records of all horses that had undergone an MRI under general anaesthesia at the University of Pennsylvania, New Bolton Center, between September 2005 and April 2012. Complications and categorical variables were examined by chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. A mixed-effects logistic regression approach was used to evaluate associations between explanatory variables and the outcome variable (complications or pyrexia). A univariable screen was used to select variables (likelihood ratio test p < 0.2) for inclusion in the multivariable analysis. Statistical significance was inferred when p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Complications were noted after MRI in 51 (17.4%) of 293 events eligible for inclusion. Complications included pyrexia (n = 35), pneumonia (n = 14), colic (n = 10), facial/nerve paralysis (n = 6), diarrhoea (n = 4), and other (n = 3). The odds of developing a post-anaesthetic complication were significantly decreased in horses that received peri-anaesthetic antimicrobials (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14-0.63, p = 0.002). Increased age (OR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.76-0.99, p = 0.03) and peri-anaesthetic antimicrobial administration (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.65, p = 0.005) were associated with a decreased odds of developing pyrexia. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Single centre retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: Potential complications including pyrexia, pneumonia and colic should be recognised when pursuing MRI under general anaesthesia. The administration of peri-anaesthetic antimicrobials decreased the odds of a complication and warrants consideration, particularly in horses that might be classified as high risk.",

    "abstract": "Gastric ulceration can be induced by athletic training and is a significant welfare concern. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of gastric ulcer induction on heart rate variability (HRV) in the horse. We hypothesized that induction of gastric ulcers would decrease HRV and increase low frequency fluctuations, consistent with increased sympathetic tone. A convenience sample of 8 horses in a larger study were enrolled. Horses were randomly assigned to receive water or 2 mg/kg omeprazole orally once daily for 28 days. Gastric ulcers were induced through intermittent feed withholding on days 21 to 28. Gastroscopy was performed and gastric ulcers were graded (0-IV) by three blinded reviewers on days 21 and 28. Continuous electrocardiograms were obtained for one hour at the start and end of ulcer induction. HRV was assessed in 1-hour recordings for time domain variables and 5 minute sections for frequency domain analysis. HRV and ulcer grade across treatments were compared by a mixed effect model, with treatment and time as fixed effects and horse as a random effect. Gastric ulcer grade increased with induction protocol (P < .0001) and decreased with omeprazole treatment (P = .0007). Omeprazole treatment increased R-R intervals (P = .01) and decreased ratio of low frequency/high frequency signal (P = .008) as compared to horses receiving water. This was attributable to decreasing low frequency fluctuations (P = .05). While limited by the small sample size (four horses/treatment), this study suggests that omeprazole treatment decreases heart rate, and LF/HF ratio during ulcer induction, consistent with a decrease in sympathetic tone.",

    "abstract": "Oxylipins are a group of bioactive fatty acid metabolites generated via enzymatic oxygenation. They are notably involved in inflammation, pain, vascular tone, hemostasis, thrombosis, immunity, and coagulation. Oxylipins have become the focus of therapeutic intervention since they are implicated in many conditions, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and aging. The liver plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and distribution throughout the organism. Long-term exposure to pesticides is suspected to contribute to hepatic carcinogenesis via notable disruption of lipid metabolism. Prometryn is a methylthio-s-triazine herbicide used to control the growth of annual broadleaf and grass weeds in many cultivated plants. The amounts of prometryn documented in the environment, mainly waters, soil and plants used for human and domestic consumption are significantly high. Previous research revealed that prometryn decreased liver development during zebrafish embryogenesis. To understand the mechanisms by which prometryn could induce hepatotoxicity, the effect of prometryn (185 mg/kg every 48 h for seven days) was investigated on hepatic and plasma oxylipin levels in mice. Using an unbiased LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics approach, prometryn was found to alter oxylipins metabolites that are mainly derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP) and lipoxygenase (LOX) in both mice liver and plasma. Lipidomic analysis revealed that the hepatotoxic effects of prometryn are associated with increased epoxide hydrolase (EH) products, increased sEH and mEH enzymatic activities, and induction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, 9-HODE and 13-HODE levels were significantly increased in prometryn treated mice liver, suggesting increased levels of oxidation products. Together, these results support that sEH may be an important component of pesticide-induced liver toxicity.",

Thus, there is an urgent need for new strategies to mitigate PDAC-associated cachexia; and the exploration of dietary interventions is a critical component. We previously observed that a ketogenic diet (KD) combined with gemcitabine enhances overall survival in the autochthonous LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53 R172H/+; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse model. In this study, we investigated the effect and cellular mechanisms of a KD in combination with gemcitabine on the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass in KPC mice. For this purpose, male and female pancreatic tumor-bearing KPC mice were allocated to a control diet (CD), a KD, a CD + gemcitabine (CG), or a KD + gemcitabine (KG) group. We observed that a KD or a KG-mitigated muscle strength declined over time and presented higher gastrocnemius weights compared CD-fed mice. Mechanistically, we observed sex-dependent effects of KG treatment, including the inhibition of autophagy, and increased phosphorylation levels of eIF2α in KG-treated KPC mice when compared to CG-treated mice. Our data suggest that a KG results in preservation of skeletal muscle mass. Additional research is warranted to explore whether this diet-treatment combination can be clinically effective in combating CAC in PDAC patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among one of the most commonly prescribed medications for pain and inflammation. Diclofenac (DIC) is a commonly prescribed NSAID that is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying its cardiotoxic effects remain largely unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that chronic exposure to DIC increases oxidative stress, which ultimately impairs cardiovascular function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were treated with DIC for 4 weeks and subsequently subjected to in vivo and in vitro functional assessments. Chronic DIC exposure resulted in not only systolic but also diastolic dysfunction. DIC treatment, however, did not alter blood pressure or electrocardiographic recordings. Importantly, treatment with DIC significantly increased inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as cardiac fibroblast activation and proliferation. There was increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cardiomyocytes from DIC-treated mice, which may contribute to the more depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced energy production, leading to a significant decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, Ca2+ transients, and sarcomere shortening. Using unbiased metabolomic analyses, we demonstrated significant alterations in oxylipin profiles towards inflammatory features in chronic DIC treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Together, chronic treatment with DIC resulted in severe cardiotoxicity, which was mediated, in part, by an increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress.",

One third of patients progress and chemotherapy is rarely used in this population. We questioned if addition of the immune-checkpoint-inhibitor (ICI) atezolizumab to standard-of-care SABR can improve outcomes. We initiated a multi-institutional single-arm phase I study (NCT02599454) enrolling twenty patients with the primary endpoint of maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy; and exploratory mechanistic correlatives. Treatment is well tolerated and full dose atezolizumab (1200 mg) is the MTD. Efficacy signals include early responses (after 2 cycles of ICI, before initiation of SABR) in 17% of patients. Biomarkers of functional adaptive immunity, including T cell activation in the tumor and response to ex-vivo stimulation by circulating T cells, are highly predictive of benefit. These results require validation and are being tested in a phase III randomized trial.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are no consensus guidelines for supplemental breast cancer screening with whole-breast ultrasound. However, criteria for women at high risk of mammography screening failures (interval invasive cancer or advanced cancer) have been identified. Mammography screening failure risk was evaluated among women undergoing supplemental ultrasound screening in clinical practice compared with women undergoing mammography alone. METHODS: A total of 38,166 screening ultrasounds and 825,360 screening mammograms without supplemental screening were identified during 2014-2020 within three Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries. Risk of interval invasive cancer and advanced cancer were determined using BCSC prediction models. High interval invasive breast cancer risk was defined as heterogeneously dense breasts and BCSC 5-year breast cancer risk ≥2.5% or extremely dense breasts and BCSC 5-year breast cancer risk ≥1.67%. Intermediate/high advanced cancer risk was defined as BCSC 6-year advanced breast cancer risk ≥0.38%. RESULTS: A total of 95.3% of 38,166 ultrasounds were among women with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts, compared with 41.8% of 825,360 screening mammograms without supplemental screening (p < .0001). Among women with dense breasts, high interval invasive breast cancer risk was prevalent in 23.7% of screening ultrasounds compared with 18.5% of screening mammograms without supplemental imaging (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.30-1.39); intermediate/high advanced cancer risk was prevalent in 32.0% of screening ultrasounds versus 30.5% of screening mammograms without supplemental screening (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound screening was highly targeted to women with dense breasts, but only a modest proportion were at high mammography screening failure risk. A clinically significant proportion of women undergoing mammography screening alone were at high mammography screening failure risk.",

    "abstract": "To determine Labyrinthin (LAB) expression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we immunostained and scored for LAB immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression on sections of tissue microarrays (TMAs) prepared from 256 archival tissue blocks of NSCLC. Propensity-score-weighted Kaplan-Meier curves and weighted Cox models were used to associate LAB expression with overall survival. LAB mRNA expression was assessed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and correlated with clinical phenotype and outcome. Positive LAB IHC expression (>5% of tumor cells) was detected in 208/256 (81.3%) of NSCLC samples, and found in both lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and lung squamous cell cancer (LUSC). LAB positivity was associated with poor overall survival (HR = 3.56, 95% CI: 2.3-5.4; p < 0.0001) and high tumor differentiation grade or metastasis compared with negative LAB expression. Univariant and multivariate survival analyses demonstrated LAB expression as an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC patients. LAB RNA expression in TCGA-LUAD was higher in primary and advanced-stage tumors than in normal tissue, and was associated with poorer overall survival. No significant differences or associations were found with LAB RNA expression in TCGA-LUSC. The LAB IHC assay is being used to identify candidate cancer patients for the first-in-human phase I trial evaluating the LAB vaccines (UCDCC#296, NCT051013560).",

    "abstract": "Structure learning is pivotal for causal discovery-driven root cause analysis (RCA). Causal discovery (CD) methods often face difficulties with datasets containing noise or missing information, resulting in causal graphs that may deviate from expert expectations, especially in scenarios with inconsistent or irregular data patterns. Conventional CD approaches frequently lack user-friendly explanatory tools, making it difficult for users to interpret outputs and iteratively enhance the inference process. Despite the inherently human-centric nature of CD, existing research has largely neglected methods that yield interpretable, expert-verifiable results while also promoting iterative collaboration between human experts and the system to refine causal inferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose an innovative framework for RCA that fosters a dynamic, two-way partnership between human expertise and AI. The approach incorporates a specialized visualization platform, allowing domain experts to navigate and analyze causal relationships effectively. Next, we introduce a mechanism for expert input to clarify variable relationships, significantly reducing ambiguity in the causal graphs produced. Furthermore, our method supports iterative model refinement through human feedback integration, allowing experts to influence RCA updates in real time. Notably, the framework facilitates the injection of domain knowledge at any stage of the process, whether proactively or reactively, ensuring seamless communication. Experiments using synthetic datasets highlight that this method not only samples causal graphs accurately but also achieves substantial improvements in inference quality with expert guidance.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative approach to 3D environmental mapping through the integration of a compact, handheld sensor package with a two-stage sensor fusion pipeline. The sensor package, incorporating LiDAR, IMU, RGB, and thermal cameras, enables comprehensive and robust 3D mapping of various environments. By leveraging Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and thermal imaging, our solution offers good performance in conditions where global positioning is unavailable and in visually degraded environments. The sensor package runs a real-time LiDAR-Inertial SLAM algorithm, generating a dense point cloud map that accurately reconstructs the geometric features of the environment. Following the acquisition of that point cloud, we post-process these data by fusing them with images from the RGB and thermal cameras and produce a detailed, color-enriched 3D map that is useful and adaptable to different mission requirements. We demonstrated our system in a variety of scenarios, from indoor to outdoor conditions, and the results showcased the effectiveness and applicability of our sensor package and fusion pipeline. This system can be applied in a wide range of applications, ranging from autonomous navigation to smart agriculture, and has the potential to make a substantial benefit across diverse fields.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires have the potential to cause severe damage to vegetation, property and most importantly, human life. In order to minimize these negative impacts, it is crucial that wildfires are detected at the earliest possible stages. A potential solution for early wildfire detection is to utilize unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are capable of tracking the chemical concentration gradient of smoke emitted by wildfires. A spatiotemporal model of wildfire smoke plume dynamics can allow for efficient tracking of the chemicals by utilizing both real-time information from sensors as well as future information from the model predictions. This study investigates a spatiotemporal modeling approach based on subspace identification (SID) to develop a data-driven smoke plume dynamics model for the purposes of early wildfire detection. The model was learned using CO2 concentration data which were collected using an air quality sensor package onboard a UAV during two prescribed burn experiments. Our model was evaluated by comparing the predicted values to the measured values at random locations and showed mean errors of 6.782 ppm and 30.01 ppm from the two experiments. Additionally, our model was shown to outperform the commonly used Gaussian puff model (GPM) which showed mean errors of 25.799 ppm and 104.492 ppm, respectively.",

However, existing co-design paradigms cannot deal with complex frequency temporal domain specifications. In this paper, we investigate the co-design problem for a class of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems with frequency temporal domain specifications. Firstly, the frequency temporal domain specifications are written in a formal language called spectral temporal logic (STL). Secondly, the satisfaction conditions of the spectral temporal logic specifications have been transformed into non-linear matrices inequality forms with necessary and sufficient conditions. Thirdly, the co-design problem is transformed into a non-convex optimisation problem with mixed-integer linear matrix inequalities (MILMIs) constraints, and then an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the co-design problem with semidefinite programming (SDP). Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the expressiveness of spectral temporal logic are illustrated with the applications to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).",

The energy efficiency of the robot is a critical aspect of its performance, determining the range and duration of missions that can be performed. This paper studies the energy-optimal planning of the multirotor, which aims at finding the optimal ordering of waypoints with the minimum energy consumption for missions in 3D space. The study is performed based on a previously developed model capturing first-principle energy dynamics of the multirotor. We found that in majority of the cases (up to 95%) the solutions of the energy-optimal planning are different from those of the traditional traveling salesman problem which minimizes the total distance. The difference can be as high as 14.9%, with the average at 1.6%-3.3% and 90th percentile at 3.7%-6.5% depending on the range and number of waypoints in the mission. We then identified and explained the key features of the minimum-energy order by correlating to the underlying flight energy dynamics. It is shown that instead of minimizing the distance, coordination of vertical and horizontal motion to promote aerodynamic efficiency is the key to optimizing energy consumption.",

The PPP provided participants with forgivable loans to pay employee salaries, increasing participants' financial flexibility during the pandemic. We examine the associations between nonprofits' prepandemic financial obligations (e.g., long-term debt and donor-restricted net assets) and PPP participation and participants' loan characteristics. First, we find nonprofit organizations participated at a lower rate than other small business industries and that nonprofits with greater financial obligations were more likely to participate in the program. Second, we find financial obligations were positively associated with the loan amount received as a percentage of total payroll costs. Last, although approximately 11% of nonprofits failed to obtain loan forgiveness, we find nonprofits with restricted net assets were more likely to have their loans forgiven. Our results suggest nonprofits with greater debt and donor obligations used the PPP to increase their financial flexibility.",

We also find some evidence that firms use incremental ETR changes to meet forecasts by key analysts. After controlling for the distance to the nearest forecast, our evidence shows that firms are more likely to beat an incremental forecast with a decrease in ETR compared to missing an incremental forecast with an increase in ETR.

Former partners affiliated with the external auditor and serving on the audit committee are a subset of audit committee members who can affect the audit. Consistent with social identity theory, we find that companies with an affiliated partner on their audit committee are less likely to dismiss the member’s former firm than companies without the affiliation. Further, we find improved audit quality and increased effectiveness of auditor effort when affiliated partners serve on the audit committee. Finally, this quality improvement occurs contemporaneously with a reduction in audit fees and time spent on fieldwork, suggesting increased efficiency. Our study provides evidence that affiliated former partners on audit committees extend the tenure of the auditor-client relationship while also improving audit processes and outcomes.",

These analysts are also more likely than analysts at other brokerages to downgrade a company’s stock after the receipt of unfavorable information about the firm. Importantly, we document that analysts at nonsanctioned brokerages also reduce the optimism of their stock recommendations when a peer analyst’s brokerage is sanctioned, consistent with spillovers as a result of routine regulatory monitoring.

    "abstract": "Here, we report the successful implementation of heritable virus-induced genome editing (VIGE) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). We generated three transgenic tomato lines expressing Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) under the control of Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (35S), S. lycopersicum ribosomal protein S5A (SlRPS5A), or S. lycopersicum YAO promoters (SlYAO). These three lines were tested for somatic and heritable editing using the tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based system carrying guide RNAs (gRNAs) fused with mobile RNA sequences. TRV with gRNA targeted to Phytoene desaturase (SlPDS) and Downy mildew resistance 6 (SlDMR6) genes fused to mobile RNA sequences showed significant somatic editing efficiency in all three tomato lines expressing SpCas9. However, the progenies from the SlYAO promoter-driven SpCas9 tomato infected with TRV with gRNA targeted to SlDMR6 fused to the mobile RNA sequence resulted in monoallelic mutations with a frequency of 3%. Optimization of environmental conditions, such as reduced light intensity, significantly increased heritable editing frequencies, from 0% to 86% at the SlPDS and from 3% to 100% at the SlDMR6, including biallelic mutations. These findings underscore the use of appropriate promoters to express Cas nucleases and optimized environmental conditions to enhance heritable genome editing efficiency in tomato using VIGE. Furthermore, our method enables the generation of mutants without additional tissue culture or transformation once a SpCas9-expressing tomato line is established.",

    "abstract": "Phytohormone levels are regulated through specialized enzymes, participating not only in their biosynthesis but also in post-signaling processes for signal inactivation and cue depletion. Arabidopsis thaliana (At) carboxylesterase 15 (CXE15) and carboxylesterase 20 (CXE20) have been shown to deplete strigolactones (SLs) that coordinate various growth and developmental processes and function as signaling molecules in the rhizosphere. Here, we elucidate the X-ray crystal structures of AtCXE15 (both apo and SL intermediate bound) and AtCXE20, revealing insights into the mechanisms of SL binding and catabolism. The N-terminal regions of CXE15 and CXE20 exhibit distinct secondary structures, with CXE15 characterized by an alpha helix and CXE20 by an alpha/beta fold. These structural differences play pivotal roles in regulating variable SL hydrolysis rates. Our findings, both in vitro and in planta, indicate that a transition of the N-terminal helix domain of CXE15 between open and closed forms facilitates robust SL hydrolysis. The results not only illuminate the distinctive process of phytohormone breakdown but also uncover a molecular architecture and mode of plasticity within a specific class of carboxylesterases.",

However, delivery of CRISPR/Cas-editing components into plant cells is still a major bottleneck and requires tissue culture-based approaches and regeneration of plants. To overcome this limitation, several plant viral vectors have recently been engineered to deliver single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targets into SpCas9-expressing plants. Here, we describe an optimized, step-by-step protocol based on the tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based vector system to deliver sgRNAs fused to mobile tRNA sequences for efficient heritable editing in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana model systems.

    "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor-mediated immunity includes rapid production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and transcriptional reprogramming, which is controlled by transcription factors (TFs). Although some TFs have been reported to participate in NLR-mediated immune response, most TFs are transcriptional activators, and whether and how transcriptional repressors regulate NLR-mediated plant defenses remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the Alfin-like 7 (AL7) interacts with N NLR and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Knockdown and knockout of AL7 compromise N NLR-mediated resistance against tobacco mosaic virus, whereas AL7 overexpression enhances defense, indicating a positive regulatory role for AL7 in immunity. AL7 binds to the promoters of ROS scavenging genes to inhibit their transcription during immune responses. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK), and wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK) directly interact with and phosphorylate AL7, which impairs the AL7-N interaction and enhances its DNA binding activity, which promotes ROS accumulation and enables immune activation. In addition to N, AL7 is also required for the function of other Toll interleukin 1 receptor/nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeats (TNLs) including Roq1 and RRS1-R/RPS4. Our findings reveal a hitherto unknown MAPK-AL7 module that negatively regulates ROS scavenging genes to promote NLR-mediated immunity.",

    "abstract": "The NLR (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat) class immune receptor Sw-5b confers resistance to Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV). Although Sw-5b is known to activate immunity upon recognition of the TSWV movement protein NSm, we know very little about the downstream events that lead to resistance. Here, we investigated the Sw-5b-mediated early transcriptomic changes that occur in response to mechanical and thrips-mediated inoculation of TSWV, using near-isogenic tomato lines CNPH-LAM 147 (Sw5b+/+) and Santa Clara (Sw-5b-/-). We observed earlier Sw-5b-mediated transcriptional changes in response to thrips-mediated inoculation compared with that in response to mechanical inoculation of TSWV. With thrips-mediated inoculation, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed at 12, 24, and 72 h postinoculation (hpi). Whereas with mechanical inoculation, DEGs were observed only at 72 hpi. Although some DEGs were shared between the two methods of inoculation, many DEGs were specific to either thrips-mediated or mechanical inoculation of TSWV. In response to thrips-mediated inoculation, an NLR immune receptor, cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase, G-type lectin S-receptor-like kinases, the ethylene response factor 1, and the calmodulin-binding protein 60 were induced. Fatty acid desaturase 2-9, cell death genes, DCL2b, RIPK/PBL14-like, ERF017, and WRKY75 were differentially expressed in response to mechanical inoculation. Our findings reveal Sw-5b responses specific to the method of TSWV inoculation. Although TSWV is transmitted in nature primarily by the thrips, Sw-5b responses to thrips inoculation have not been previously studied. Therefore, the DEGs we have identified in response to thrips-mediated inoculation provide a new foundation for understanding the mechanistic roles of these genes in the Sw-5b-mediated resistance.

    "abstract": "High-yielding varieties developed in the 1960s and 1970s at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and elsewhere benefited farmers and the public, ultimately increasing yields and reducing the cost of rice to consumers. Most of these varieties, however, did not have the optimum cooking quality that was possessed by many of the traditional varieties they replaced. In 1985, the IRRI-developed indica variety IR64 was released in the Philippines. In addition to its high yield, early maturity and disease resistance, it had excellent cooking quality, matching that of the best varieties available. These merits resulted in its rapid spread and cultivation on over 10 million ha in the two decades after it was released. It has intermediate amylose content and gelatinization temperature, and good taste. It is resistant to blast and bacterial blight diseases, and to brown planthopper. Because of its success as a variety, it has been used extensively in scientific studies and has been well-characterized genetically. Many valuable genes have been introduced into IR64 through backcross breeding and it has been used in thousands of crosses. Its area of cultivation has declined in the past 10 years, but it has been replaced by a new generation of high-quality varieties that are mostly its progeny or relatives. Continued basic studies on IR64 and related varieties should help in unraveling the complex genetic control of yield and other desirable traits that are prized by rice farmers and consumers.",

    "abstract": "Meeting the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited resources will require increasing the yield potential of staple crops, such as rice. Yet many high-yielding, intensive production systems have experienced slow rates of yield improvement in recent years despite a demonstrated increase in the yield potential of new crop cultivars. We analyzed experimental data from one such cropping system, i.e., California (CA) rice, in order to quantify improvements made in the genetic yield potential obtained through plant breeding. California rice systems are among the highest in the world and close to maximum yield potential. Specifically, the hypothesis was tested that if rice cultivar yields decline over time then apparent yield increases in side-by-side yield comparison tests will not reflect increases in yield potential. This hypothesis was tested using 33 years of experimental yield data from the California Cooperative Rice Research Foundation Rice Experiment Station. Based on side-by-side comparisons of old and new rice cultivars which do not consider yield decline over time, there was an apparent increase in yield. However, the yields of older cultivars were found to decline at an estimated rate of 29.3 kg ha−1 year−1 (90% credible interval −4.4 to −53.3) after initial selection. Once this effect was considered, the yield advantage of newer cultivars over old was uncertain (−3.3 kg ha−1 year−1, 90% credible interval −36.1 to 31.5). These results highlight (1) the importance of continuous crop improvement and deployment of new cultivars simply to maintain existing yields, and (2) to increase the genetic yield potential, higher yield targets are needed. Importantly, when breeding near the yield potential, despite the limited yield gains, significant advances in improving quality and reducing crop duration have been made.",

    "abstract": "Neuromusculoskeletal injuries including osteoarthritis, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury affect roughly 19% of the U.S. adult population. Standardized interventions have produced suboptimal functional outcomes due to the unique treatment needs of each patient. Strides have been made to utilize computational models to develop personalized treatments, but researchers and clinicians have yet to cross the \"valley of death\" between fundamental research and clinical usefulness. This article introduces the Neuromusculoskeletal Modeling (NMSM) Pipeline, two MATLAB-based toolsets that add Model Personalization and Treatment Optimization functionality to OpenSim. The two toolsets facilitate computational design of individualized treatments for neuromusculoskeletal impairments through the use of personalized neuromusculoskeletal models and predictive simulation. The Model Personalization toolset contains four tools for personalizing 1) joint structure models, 2) muscle-tendon models, 3) neural control models, and 4) foot-ground contact models. The Treatment Optimization toolset contains three tools for predicting and optimizing a patient's functional outcome for different treatment options using a patient's personalized neuromusculoskeletal model with direct collocation optimal control methods. Support for user-defined cost functions and model modification functions facilitate simulation of a vast number of possible treatments. An NMSM Pipeline use case is presented for an individual post-stroke with impaired walking function, where the goal was to predict how the subject's neural control could be changed to improve walking speed without increasing metabolic cost. First the Model Personalization toolset was used to develop a personalized neuromusculoskeletal model of the subject starting from a generic OpenSim full-body model and experimental walking data (video motion capture, ground reaction, and electromyography) collected from the subject at his self-selected speed. Next the Treatment Optimization toolset was used with the personalized model to predict how the subject could recruit existing muscle synergies more effectively to reduce muscle activation disparities between the paretic and non-paretic legs. The software predicted that the subject could increase his walking speed by 60% without increasing his metabolic cost per unit time by modifying existing muscle synergy recruitment. This hypothetical treatment demonstrates how NMSM Pipeline tools could allow researchers working collaboratively with clinicians to develop personalized neuromusculoskeletal models of individual patients and to perform predictive simulations for the purpose of designing personalized treatments that maximize a patient's post-treatment functional outcome.",

    "issued": "2024-08",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genetic association studies can reveal biology and treatment targets but have received limited attention for stroke recovery. STRONG (Stroke, Stress, Rehabilitation, and Genetics) was a prospective, longitudinal (1-year), genetic study in adults with stroke at 28 US stroke centers. The primary aim was to examine the association that candidate genetic variants have with (1) motor/functional outcomes and (2) stress-related outcomes. METHODS: For motor/functional end points, 3 candidate gene variants (ApoE ε4, BDNF [brain-derived neurotrophic factor], and a dopamine polygenic score) were analyzed for associations with change in grip strength (3 months-baseline), function (3-month Stroke Impact Scale-Activities of Daily Living), mood (3-month Patient Health Questionnaire-8), and cognition (12-month telephone-Montreal Cognitive Assessment). For stress-related outcomes, 7 variants (serotonin transporter gene-linked promoter region, ACE [angiotensin-converting enzyme], oxytocin receptor, FKBP5 [FKBP prolyl isomerase 5], FAAH [fatty acid amide hydrolase], BDNF, and COMT [catechol-O-methyltransferase]) were assessed for associations with posttraumatic stress disorder ([PTSD]; PTSD Primary Care Scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8) at 6 and 12 months; stress-related genes were examined as a function of poststroke stress level. Statistical models (linear, negative binomial, or Poisson regression) were based on response variable distribution; all included stroke severity, age, sex, and ancestry as covariates. Stroke subtype was explored secondarily. Data were Holm-Bonferroni corrected. A secondary replication analysis tested whether the rs1842681 polymorphism (identified in the GISCOME study [Genetics of Ischaemic Stroke Functional Outcome]) was related to 3-month modified Rankin Scale score in STRONG. RESULTS: The 763 enrollees were 63.1±14.9 (mean±SD) years of age, with a median initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 4 (interquartile range, 2-9); outcome data were available in n=515 at 3 months, n=500 at 6 months, and n=489 at 12 months. At 1 year poststroke, the rs6265 (BDNF) variant was associated with poorer cognition (0.9-point lower telephone-Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, P=1×10-5). For stress-related outcomes, rs4291 (ACE) and rs324420 (FAAH) were risk factors linking increased poststroke stress with higher 1-year depression and PTSD symptoms (P<0.05), while rs4680 (COMT) linked poststroke stress with lower 1-year depression and PTSD. Findings were unchanged when considering stroke subtype. STRONG replicated GISCOME: rs1842681 was associated with lower 3-month modified Rankin Scale score (P=3.2×10-5). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified genetic associations with cognitive function, depression, and PTSD 1 year poststroke. Genetic susceptibility to PTSD and depressive symptoms varied according to the amount of poststroke stress, underscoring the critical role of lived experiences in recovery. Together, the results suggest that genetic association studies provide insights into the biology of stroke recovery in humans.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A common framework is needed to assess walking impairments in older adults and individuals with stroke. This study develops an Assessment of Bilateral Locomotor Efficacy (ABLE) that is a straightforward indicator of walking function. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can we develop a clinically accessible index of walking function that summarizes gait dysfunction secondary to stroke? METHODS: The ABLE index was developed using a retrospective sample of 14 community-dwelling older adults. Data from 33 additional older adults and 105 individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis were used to validate the index by factor analysis of the score components and correlation with multiple common assessments of lower extremity impairment and function. RESULTS: The ABLE consists of four components summed for a maximum possible score of 12. The components include self-selected walking speed (SSWS), speed change from SSWS to fastest speed, non-paretic leg step length change from SSWS to fastest speed, and peak paretic leg ankle power. The ABLE revealed good concurrent validity with all recorded functional assessments. Factor analysis suggested that the ABLE measures two factors: one for forward progression and another for speed adaptability. SIGNIFICANCE: The ABLE offers a straightforward, objective measure of walking function in adults, including individuals with chronic stroke. The index may also prove useful as a screening tool for subclinical pathology in community-dwelling older adults, but further testing is required. We encourage utilization of this index and reproduction of findings to adapt and refine the instrument for wider use and eventual clinical application.",

    "issued": "2023",
    "abstract": "Muscle forces and joint moments estimated by electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal models are sensitive to the wrapping surface geometry defining muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms. Despite this sensitivity, wrapping surface properties are typically not personalized to subject movement data. This study developed a novel method for personalizing OpenSim cylindrical wrapping surfaces during EMG-driven model calibration. To avoid the high computational cost of repeated OpenSim muscle analyses, the method uses two-level polynomial surrogate models. Outer-level models specify time-varying muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms as functions of joint angles, while inner-level models specify time-invariant outer-level polynomial coefficients as functions of wrapping surface parameters. To evaluate the method, we used walking data collected from two individuals post-stroke and performed four variations of EMG-driven lower extremity model calibration: 1) no calibration of scaled generic wrapping surfaces (NGA), 2) calibration of outer-level polynomial coefficients for all muscles (SGA), 3) calibration of outer-level polynomial coefficients only for muscles with wrapping surfaces (LSGA), and 4) calibration of cylindrical wrapping surface parameters for muscles with wrapping surfaces (PGA). On average compared to NGA, SGA reduced lower extremity joint moment matching errors by 31%, LSGA by 24%, and PGA by 12%, with the largest reductions occurring at the hip. Furthermore, PGA reduced peak hip joint contact force by 47% bodyweight, which was the most consistent with published in vivo measurements. The proposed method for EMG-driven model calibration with wrapping surface personalization produces physically realistic OpenSim models that reduce joint moment matching errors while improving prediction of hip joint contact force.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke is a sudden-onset, uncontrollable event; stroke-related stress may impede rehabilitation and recovery. Lifetime stress may sensitize patients to experiencing greater stroke-related stress and indirectly affect outcomes. We examine lifetime stress as predictor of poststroke acute stress and examine lifetime and acute stress as predictors of 3- and 12-month functional status. We also compare acute stress and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale as predictors of poststroke functional status. METHODS: Between 2016 and 2020 the STRONG Study (Stroke, Stress, Rehabilitation, and Genetics) enrolled adults with new radiologically confirmed stroke 2 to 10 days poststroke onset at 28 acute care US hospitals. Participants were interviewed 3 times: acute admission (acute stress; Acute Stress Disorder Interview), 3 months (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity motor impairment [Fugl-Meyer Upper Arm Assessment; N=431], modified Rankin Scale [3 months; N=542], Stroke Impact Scale-Activities of Daily Living [3 months; N=511], Lifetime Stress Exposure Inventory), and 12 months (modified Rankin Scale, N=533; Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 Activities of Daily Living; N=485; Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment; N=484) poststroke. Structural equation models examined whether acute stress predicted 3- and 12-month functional outcomes, and mediated an association between lifetime stress and outcomes controlling for demographics and initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Standardized betas are reported. RESULTS: Sample (N=763) was 19 to 95 years old (mean=63; SD=14.9); 448 (58.7%) were male. Acute stress scores ranged from 0 to 14 (mean, 3.52 [95% CI, 3.31-3.73]). Controlling for age, gender, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and race and ethnicity, higher lifetime stress predicted higher acute stress (β=0.18, P<0.001), which predicted lower 3-month Fugl-Meyer Upper Arm Assessment scores (β=-0.19, P<0.001), lower Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 Activities of Daily Living scores at 3 months (β=-0.21, P<0.001) and 12 months (β=-0.21, P<0.001), higher modified Rankin Scale scores at 3 months (β=0.23, P<0.001) and 12 months (β=0.22, P<0.001), and lower 12-month Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (β=-0.20, P<0.001). Acute stress predicted 12-month tMoCA (χ2[1]=5.29, P=0.022) more strongly, 3-month and 12-month modified Rankin Scale and SIS scores as strongly (all Ps>0.18), but Fugl-Meyer scores (χ2[1]=7.01, P=0.008) less strongly than baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime stress/trauma is associated with more poststroke acute stress, which is associated with greater motor and cognitive impairment and disability 3 and 12 months poststroke. Poststroke interventions for acute stress may help mitigate stroke-related disability.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a proposed risk factor for multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. However, the molecular mechanisms through which MIA imparts risk remain poorly understood. A recently developed nonhuman primate model of exposure to the viral mimic poly:ICLC during pregnancy shows abnormal social and repetitive behaviors and elevated striatal dopamine, a molecular hallmark of human psychosis, providing an unprecedented opportunity for studying underlying molecular correlates. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing across psychiatrically relevant brain regions (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, hippocampus) and primary visual cortex for comparison from 3.5- to 4-year-old male MIA-exposed and control offspring-an age comparable to mid adolescence in humans. RESULTS: We identify 266 unique genes differentially expressed in at least one brain region, with the greatest number observed in hippocampus. Co-expression networks identified region-specific alterations in synaptic signaling and oligodendrocytes. Although we observed temporal and regional differences, transcriptomic changes were shared across first- and second-trimester exposures, including for the top differentially expressed genes-PIWIL2 and MGARP. In addition to PIWIL2, several other regulators of retrotransposition and endogenous transposable elements were dysregulated following MIA, potentially connecting MIA to retrotransposition. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results begin to elucidate the brain-level molecular processes through which MIA may impart risk for psychiatric disease.",

    "abstract": "There is substantial evidence that both N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction and dysfunction of GABAergic neurotransmission contribute to schizophrenia, though the relationship between these pathophysiological processes remains largely unknown. Although models using cell-type-specific genetic deletion of NMDARs have been informative, they display overly pronounced phenotypes extending beyond those of schizophrenia. Here, we used the serine racemase knockout (SRKO) mice, a model of reduced NMDAR activity rather than complete receptor elimination, to examine the link between NMDAR hypofunction and decreased GABAergic inhibition. The SRKO mice, in which there is a >90% reduction in the NMDAR coagonist d-serine, exhibit many of the neurochemical and behavioral abnormalities observed in schizophrenia. We found a significant reduction in inhibitory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal neurons in the SRKO mice. This reduction increases the excitation/inhibition balance resulting in enhanced synaptically driven neuronal excitability without changes in intrinsic excitability. Consistently, significant reductions in inhibitory synapse density in CA1 were observed by immunohistochemistry. We further show, using a single-neuron genetic deletion approach, that the loss of GABAergic synapses onto pyramidal neurons observed in the SRKO mice is driven in a cell-autonomous manner following the deletion of SR in individual CA1 pyramidal cells. These results support a model whereby NMDAR hypofunction in pyramidal cells disrupts GABAergic synapses leading to disrupted feedback inhibition and impaired neuronal synchrony.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Recently, disruption of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance has become an area of considerable interest for psychiatric research. Here, we report a reduction in inhibition in the serine racemase knockout mouse model of schizophrenia that increases E/I balance and enhances synaptically driven neuronal excitability. This reduced inhibition was driven cell-autonomously in pyramidal cells lacking serine racemase, suggesting a novel mechanism for how chronic NMDA receptor hypofunction can disrupt information processing in schizophrenia.",

Animal models provide an opportunity to identify mechanisms driving neuropathology associated with MIA. We performed time-course transcriptional profiling of mouse cortical development following induced MIA via poly(I:C) injection at E12.5. MIA-driven transcriptional changes were validated via protein analysis, and parallel perturbations to cortical neuroanatomy were identified via imaging. MIA-induced acute upregulation of genes associated with hypoxia, immune signaling, and angiogenesis, by 6 hr following exposure. This acute response was followed by changes in proliferation, neuronal and glial specification, and cortical lamination that emerged at E14.5 and peaked at E17.5. Decreased numbers of proliferative cells in germinal zones and alterations in neuronal and glial populations were identified in the MIA-exposed cortex. Overall, paired transcriptomic and neuroanatomical characterization revealed a sequence of perturbations to corticogenesis driven by mid-gestational MIA.",

    "issued": "2020-08",
    "abstract": "Despite the potential of rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA) to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic interventions for a range of psychiatric disorders, current approaches using these models ignore two of the most important aspects of this risk factor for human disease: (i) most pregnancies are resilient to maternal viral infection and (ii) susceptible pregnancies can lead to different combinations of phenotypes in offspring. Here, we report two new sources of variability-the baseline immunoreactivity (BIR) of isogenic females prior to pregnancy and differences in immune responses in C57BL/6 dams across vendors-that contribute to resilience and susceptibility to distinct combinations of behavioral and biological outcomes in offspring. Similar to the variable effects of human maternal infection, MIA in mice does not cause disease-related phenotypes in all pregnancies and a combination of poly(I:C) dose and BIR predicts susceptibility and resilience of pregnancies to aberrant repetitive behaviors and alterations in striatal protein levels in offspring. Even more surprising is that the intermediate levels of BIR and poly(I:C) dose are most detrimental to offspring, with higher BIR and poly(I:C) doses conferring resilience to measured phenotypes in offspring. Importantly, we identify the BIR of female mice as a biomarker before pregnancy that predicts which dams will be most at risk as well as biomarkers in the brains of newborn offspring that correlate with changes in repetitive behaviors. Together, our results highlight considerations for optimizing MIA protocols to enhance rigor and reproducibility and reveal new factors that drive susceptibility of some pregnancies and resilience of others to MIA-induced abnormalities in offspring.",

Asynchronous work, in combination with group interaction and problem solving, differentiates collaborative learning from other interactive teaching methods. In this study, three professors and five student participants individually reflected on a past collaborative learning experience that they considered successful. Reflections were coded using thematic analysis. Themes that emerged from participant’s descriptions of successful collaborative learning were: (a) familiarity with collaborative learning, (b) relationships, (c) benefits, (d) motivations, and (e) design and process. Furthermore, a phenomenographic theoretical framework revealed that a participant’s prior experiences generated significant variation in what characteristics they described as promoting success in collaborative learning. Past experiences that can generate this variation include training in educational theory, participation in and familiarity with related research, the individual’s role, prior experience with collaborative learning as a student, and advocacy by one’s professor before participation in collaborative learning. Our findings can inform educational practice, improving the implementation of collaborative learning pedagogies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mobilization is safe and associated with improved outcomes in critically ill adults, but little is known about mobilization of critically ill children. OBJECTIVE: To implement a standardized mobilization therapy protocol in a pediatric intensive care unit and improve mobilization of patients. METHODS: A goal-directed mobilization protocol was instituted as a quality improvement project in a 20-bed cardiac and medical-surgical pediatric intensive care unit within an academic tertiary care center. The mobilization goal was based on age and severity of illness. Data on severity of illness, ordered activity limitations, baseline functioning, mobilization level, complications of mobilization, and mobilization barriers were collected. Goal mobilization was defined as a ratio of mobilization level to severity of illness of 1 or greater. RESULTS: In 9 months, 567 patient encounters were analyzed, 294 (52%) of which achieved goal mobilization. The mean ratio of mobilization level to severity of illness improved slightly but nonsignificantly. Encounters that met mobilization goals were in younger (P = .04) and more ill (P < .001) patients and were less likely to have barriers (P < .001) than encounters not meeting the goals. Complication rate was 2.5%, with no difference between groups (P = .18). No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary, multiprofessional, goal-directed mobilization protocol achieved goal mobilization in more than 50% of patients in this pediatric intensive care unit. Undermobilized patients were older, less ill, and more likely to have mobilization barriers at the patient and provider level.",

    "abstract": "Management of Monilinia laxa, the causal agent of brown rot blossom blight in almond (Prunus dulcis), relies heavily on the use of chemical fungicides during bloom. However, chemical fungicides can have nontarget effects on beneficial arthropods, including pollinators, and select for resistance in the pathogen of concern. Almond yield is heavily reliant on successful pollination by healthy honey bees (Apis mellifera); thus, identifying sustainable, effective, and pollinator-friendly control methods for blossom blight during bloom is desirable. Flower-inhabiting microbes could provide a natural, sustainable form of biocontrol for M. laxa, while potentially minimizing costly nontarget effects on almond pollinators and the services they provide. As pollinators are sensitive to floral microbes and their associated taste and scent cues, assessing effects of prospective biocontrol species on pollinator attraction is also necessary. Here, our objective was to isolate and identify potential biocontrol microbes from an array of agricultural and natural flowering hosts and test their efficacy in suppressing M. laxa growth in culture. Out of an initial 287 bacterial and fungal isolates identified, 56 were screened using a dual culture plate assay. Most strains reduced M. laxa growth in vitro. Ten particularly effective candidate microbes were further screened for their effect on honey bee feeding. Of the 10, nine were found to both strongly suppress M. laxa growth in culture and not reduce honey bee feeding. These promising results suggest a number of strong candidates for augmentative microbial biocontrol of brown rot blossom blight in almond with potentially minimal effects on honey bee pollination.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Approximately half of ischemic strokes (IS) in cancer patients are cryptogenic, with many presumed cardioembolic. We evaluated whether there were specific miRNA and mRNA transcriptome architectures in peripheral blood of IS patients with and without comorbid cancer, and between cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic IS etiologies in comorbid cancer. METHODS: We studied patients with cancer and IS (CS; n = 42), stroke only (SO; n = 41), and cancer only (n = 28), and vascular risk factor-matched controls (n = 30). mRNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data, analyzed with linear regression models, identified differentially expressed genes in CS versus SO and in cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic CS, and miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs. Network-level analyses identified stroke etiology-specific responses in CS. RESULTS: A total of 2,085 mRNAs and 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed between CS and SO. In CS, 122 and 35 miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs, and 5 and 3 coexpressed gene modules, were associated with cardioembolic and noncardioembolic CS, respectively. Complement, growth factor, and immune/inflammatory pathways showed differences between IS etiologies in CS. A 15-gene biomarker panel assembled from a derivation cohort (n = 50) correctly classified 81% of CS and 71% of SO participants in a validation cohort (n = 33). Another 15-gene panel correctly identified etiologies for 13 of 13 CS-cardioembolic and 11 of 11 CS-noncardioembolic participants upon cross-validation; 11 of 16 CS-cryptogenic participants were predicted cardioembolic. INTERPRETATION: We discovered unique mRNA and miRNA transcriptome architecture in CS and SO, and in CS with different IS etiologies. Cardioembolic and noncardioembolic etiologies in CS showed unique coexpression networks and potential master regulators. These may help distinguish CS from SO and identify IS etiology in cryptogenic CS patients. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:565-581.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Theories of amygdala function are central to our understanding of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, limited knowledge of the molecular and cellular composition of the amygdala impedes translational research aimed at developing new treatments and interventions. The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the composition of amygdala cells to help bridge the gap between preclinical models and human psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. METHODS: Tissue was dissected from multiple amygdala subnuclei in both humans (N=3, male) and rhesus macaques (N=3, male). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed to characterize the transcriptomes of individual nuclei. RESULTS: The results reveal substantial heterogeneity between regions, even when restricted to inhibitory or excitatory neurons. Consistent with previous work, the data highlight the complexities of individual marker genes for uniquely targeting specific cell types. Cross-species analyses suggest that the rhesus monkey model is well-suited to understanding the human amygdala, but also identify limitations. For example, a cell cluster in the ventral lateral nucleus of the amygdala (vLa) is enriched in humans relative to rhesus macaques. Additionally, the data describe specific cell clusters with relative enrichment of disorder-related genes. These analyses point to the human-enriched vLa cell cluster as relevant to autism spectrum disorder, potentially highlighting a vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders that has emerged in recent primate evolution. Further, a cluster of cells expressing markers for intercalated cells is enriched for genes reported in human genome-wide association studies of neuroticism, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings shed light on the composition of the amygdala and identify specific cell types that can be prioritized in basic science research to better understand human psychopathology and guide the development of potential treatments.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            MicroRNA (miRNA) expression is altered following ischemic stroke. Advances in RNA sequencing and bioinformatic tools allow study of isomiRs, isoforms of miRNA, which can have altered regulatory actions from canonical parent miRNA due to base modifications within the molecule or on the flanking regions. Here, we characterize isomiRs in the blood of ischemic stroke patients compared to vascular risk factor controls (VRFCs) and elucidate diversity of the post-stroke miRNA environment. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood of 47 ischemic stroke patients and 31 VRFCs using PAXgene protocol. Small RNA libraries were prepared using QIAseq miRNA Library Kit and sequenced to 14±2 M 1x75 bp reads. Raw sequence reads were trimmed, de-duplicated, and profiled using\n            <jats:italic>isomiRmap</jats:italic>\n            , which separates isomiRs from canonical miRNA sequences based on 3’ and 5’ miRNA modifications. Analysis of differentially expressed isomiRs was performed with DESeq2. A total of 74,562 unique isomiRs were identified, the majority expressed at very low level. Filtering for low abundance left 2,133 isomiRs (from 335 canonical miRNA) expressed in all subjects. Of these, 505 isomiRs (from 129 canonical miRNA) were differentially expressed (LFC &gt; |0.5|, p\n            <jats:sub>adj</jats:sub>\n            &lt; 0.05) between stroke and VRFCs. These isomiRs represent significant elevations in 3’ modifications (68.3% of DE isomiRs), 5’ modifications (20.2%) and non-template additions (34.3%). miRNA previously implicated in stroke had diverse isomiR profiles including cases where all isomiRs within a miRNA group were differentially expressed (e.g. let-7i) and cases where multiple isomiRs were present but not differentially expressed (e.g. miR-363). Four of 28 differentially expressed let-7i isomiRs have changes to the seed region that interacts with mRNA. Thus, miRNA-mRNA interactions distinct from the canonical let-7i seed may exist and play an altered role in stroke pathology and neuroinflammation. Analysis of small noncoding RNA sensitive to base-specific variations detects many differentially expressed isomiRs and highlights the complexity of the post-stroke miRNA environment. Further study of these isomiRs within mRNA regulatory networks will deepen our understanding of stroke related neuroinflammation and neural repair.\n          </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been tested in multiple clinical trials to treat peripheral artery disease, especially the more severe form called critical limb ischemia. However, MSCs have often not met the expected efficacy endpoints. We developed a more potent therapeutic by genetically modifying MSCs to overexpress Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A165). Here, we report preclinical studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of our Investigational New Drug submission package. In vitro studies included the characterization of cell banks, transcriptome and secretome analysis, and in vitro potency assays. In vivo studies using immune-deficient NSG mice include dose-finding efficacy studies using a Matrigel plug model, cell retention studies, measurements of circulating VEGF, and toxicology studies to rule out severe adverse events. Our results suggest both the safety and efficacy of MSC/VEGF and support a first-in-human clinical trial to test this new combined cell/gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS), the most common form of primary bone cancer in young adults, has had no improvements in clinical outcomes in 50 years. This highlights a critical need to advance mechanistic understanding of OS to further therapeutic discovery, which will only be possible with accurate models of the disease. Compared to traditional monolayer studies and preclinical models, in vitro models that better replicate the three-dimensional (3D) bone marrow microenvironment will facilitate methodical investigations of the events and factors that drive OS progression. Herein, we use fibrin-alginate interpenetrating network (FA IPN) hydrogels to model the hematological bone marrow environment. We interrogated the effects of oxygen tension, 3D culture, and macrophage phenotype on OS behavior and specifically examine the immunomodulatory crosstalk between OS and macrophages. We observe that OS is more sensitive to oxygen tension when cultured in 3D. Specifically, both highly and less metastatic OS exhibit decreased changes in DNA content over time in 3D, but then demonstrate diverging behaviors in heterotypic culture with macrophages. OS response to macrophages differs as a function of metastatic potential, where highly metastatic OS shows increased immunosuppression that varies with oxygen tension but relies on direct coculture conditions. To our knowledge, this is among the first work to report the effects of 3D culture on the interplay between OS and macrophages in a coculture microenvironment. Together, these data introduce FA IPNs as a promising platform for cancer research and emphasize the importance of novel models for the mechanistic study of OS.",

    "abstract": "Despite the well-known relevance of polyamines to many forms of life, little is known about how polyamines regulate osteogenesis and skeletal homeostasis. Here, we report a series of in vitro studies conducted with human-bone-marrow-derived pluripotent stromal cells (MSCs). First, we show that during osteogenic differentiation, mRNA levels of most polyamine-associated enzymes are relatively constant, except for the catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), which is strongly increased at both mRNA and protein levels. As a result, the intracellular spermidine to spermine ratio is significantly reduced during the early stages of osteoblastogenesis. Supplementation of cells with exogenous spermidine or spermine decreases matrix mineralization in a dose-dependent manner. Employing N-cyclohexyl-1,3-propanediamine (CDAP) to chemically inhibit spermine synthase (SMS), the enzyme catalyzing conversion of spermidine into spermine, also suppresses mineralization. Intriguingly, this reduced mineralization is rescued with DFMO, an inhibitor of the upstream polyamine enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1). Similarly, high concentrations of CDAP cause cytoplasmic vacuolization and alter mitochondrial function, which are also reversible with the addition of DFMO. Altogether, these studies suggest that excess polyamines, especially spermidine, negatively affect hydroxyapatite synthesis of primary MSCs, whereas inhibition of polyamine synthesis with DFMO rescues most, but not all of these defects. These findings are relevant for patients with Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS), as the presenting skeletal defects-associated with SMS deficiency-could potentially be ameliorated by treatment with DFMO.",

    "abstract": "Purpose of Review: Describe the rationale for preconditioning MSCs prior to use as therapy and the state-of-the-art of using preconditioning of MSCs in clinical settings. Recent Findings: Mounting preclinical data supports preconditioning of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. Most research has focused on cytokine priming and hypoxic preconditioning, while other approaches, such as glycoengineering, remain relatively understudied. Despite strong preclinical data, clinical evidence supporting preconditioning strategies are limited to six Phase I clinical trials (most of them in progress). Summary: Here, we succinctly discuss the rationale for preconditioning using cytokines, hypoxia, and glycoengineering, while elaborating on the respective clinical experiences. Overall, we note that preconditioning is highly dependent on the desired application, and therefore requires elucidating the mechanism of action of the MSCs used for therapy. Preconditioning may also help mitigate heterogeneity of MSC lots. Based on the remarkable safety profile of MSCs, even when used in allogeneic settings, the role of preconditioning prior to their final formulation might be the key to reach expected therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Science-informed decisions are best guided by the objective synthesis of the totality of evidence around a particular question and assessing its trustworthiness through systematic processes. However, there are major barriers and challenges that limit science-informed food and nutrition policy, practice, and guidance. First, insufficient evidence, primarily due to acquisition cost of generating high-quality data, and the complexity of the diet-disease relationship. Furthermore, the sheer number of systematic reviews needed across the entire agriculture and food value chain, and the cost and time required to conduct them, can delay the translation of science to policy. Artificial intelligence offers the opportunity to (i) better understand the complex etiology of diet-related chronic diseases, (ii) bring more precision to our understanding of the variation among individuals in the diet-chronic disease relationship, (iii) provide new types of computed data related to the efficacy and effectiveness of nutrition/food interventions in health promotion, and (iv) automate the generation of systematic reviews that support timely decisions. These advances include the acquisition and synthesis of heterogeneous and multimodal datasets. This perspective summarizes a meeting convened at the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The purpose of the meeting was to examine the current state and future potential of artificial intelligence in generating new types of computed data as well as automating the generation of systematic reviews to support evidence-based food and nutrition policy, practice, and guidance.",

    "abstract": "When grapes are exposed to wildfire smoke, certain smoke-related volatile phenols (VPs) can be absorbed into the fruit, where they can be then converted into volatile-phenol (VP) glycosides through glycosylation. These volatile-phenol glycosides can be particularly problematic from a winemaking standpoint as they can be hydrolyzed, releasing volatile phenols, which can contribute to smoke-related off-flavors. Current methods for quantitating these volatile-phenol glycosides present several challenges, including the requirement of expensive capital equipment, limited accuracy due to the molecular complexity of the glycosides, and the utilization of harsh reagents. To address these challenges, we proposed an enzymatic hydrolysis method enabled by a tailored enzyme cocktail of novel glycosidases discovered through genome mining, and the generated VPs from VP glycosides can be quantitated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The enzyme cocktails displayed high activities and a broad substrate scope when using commercially available VP glycosides as the substrates for testing. When evaluated in an industrially relevant matrix of Cabernet Sauvignon wine and grapes, this enzymatic cocktail consistently achieved a comparable efficacy of acid hydrolysis. The proposed method offers a simple, safe, and affordable option for smoke taint analysis.",

    "abstract": "Automated generation of knowledge graphs that accurately capture published information can help with knowledge organization and access, which have the potential to accelerate discovery and innovation. Here, we present an integrated pipeline to construct a large-scale knowledge graph using large language models in an active learning setting. We apply our pipeline to the association of raw food, ingredients, and chemicals, a domain that lacks such knowledge resources. By using an iterative active learning approach of 4120 manually curated premise-hypothesis pairs as training data for ten consecutive cycles, the entailment model extracted 230,848 food-chemical composition relationships from 155,260 scientific papers, with 106,082 (46.0 %) of them never been reported in any published database. To augment the knowledge incorporated in the knowledge graph, we further incorporated information from 5 external databases and ontology sources. We then applied a link prediction model to identify putative food-chemical relationships that were not part of the constructed knowledge graph. Validation of the 443 hypotheses generated by the link prediction model resulted in 355 new food-chemical relationships, while results show that the model score correlates well (R2 = 0.70) with the probability of a novel finding. This work demonstrates how automated learning from literature at scale can accelerate discovery and support practical applications through reproducible, evidence-based capture of latent interactions of diverse entities, such as food and chemicals.",

Herein, we investigate the role of IL-23 in the activation of myeloid cell subsets that contribute to skin inflammation in mice and man. IL-23 gene transfer in WT, IL-23RGFP reporter mice and subsequent analysis with spectral cytometry show that IL-23 regulates early innate immune events by inducing the expansion of a myeloid MDL1+CD11b+Ly6G+ population that dictates epidermal hyperplasia, acanthosis, and parakeratosis; hallmark pathologic features of psoriasis. Genetic ablation of MDL-1, a major PU.1 transcriptional target during myeloid differentiation exclusively expressed in myeloid cells, completely prevents IL-23-pathology. Moreover, we show that IL-23-induced myeloid subsets are also capable of producing IL-17A and IL-23R+MDL1+ cells are present in the involved skin of psoriasis patients and gene expression correlations between IL-23 and MDL-1 have been validated in multiple patient cohorts. Collectively, our data demonstrate a novel role of IL-23 in MDL-1-myelopoiesis that is responsible for skin inflammation and related pathologies. Our data open a new avenue of investigations regarding the role of IL-23 in the activation of myeloid immunoreceptors and their role in autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical models are ubiquitous and essential for drug discovery, yet our understanding of how well they translate to clinical outcomes is limited. In this study, we investigate the translational success of treatments for Clostridium difficile infection from animal models to human patients. Our analysis shows that only 36% of the preclinical and clinical experiment pairs result in translation success. Univariate analysis shows that the sustained response endpoint is correlated with translation failure (SRC = -0.20, p-value = 1.53 × 10-54), and explainability analysis of multi-variate random forest models shows that both sustained response endpoint and subject age are negative predictors of translation success. We have developed a recommendation system to help plan the right preclinical study given factors such as drug dosage, bacterial dosage, and preclinical/clinical endpoint. With an accuracy of 0.76 (F1 score of 0.71) and by using only 7 features (out of 68 total), the proposed system boosts translational efficiency by 25%. The method presented can extend to any disease and can serve as a preclinical to clinical translation decision support system to accelerate drug discovery and de-risk clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In animal contests, winners of previous contests often keep winning and losers keep losing. This coupling of previous experiences to future success, referred to as the winner–loser effect, plays a key role in stabilizing the resulting dominance hierarchies. Despite their importance, the cognitive mechanisms through which these effects occur are unknown. Identifying the mechanisms behind winner–loser effects requires identifying plausible models and generating predictions that can be used to test these alternative hypotheses. Winner–loser effects are often accompanied by a change in the aggressiveness of experienced individuals, which suggests individuals may be adjusting their self-assessment of their abilities after each contest. This updating of a prior estimate can be effectively described by Bayesian updating, and here we implement an agent-based model with continuous Bayesian updating to explore whether this is a plausible explanation of winner–loser effects. We first show that Bayesian updating reproduces known empirical results of typical dominance interactions. We then provide a series of testable predictions that can be used in future empirical work to distinguish Bayesian updating from simpler mechanisms. Our work demonstrates the utility of Bayesian updating as a mechanism to explain and ultimately predict changes in behaviour after salient social experiences.",

    "issued": "2024",
    "abstract": "Predation threat is a major driver of behavior in many prey species. Animals can recognize their relative risk of predation based on cues in the environment, including visual and/or chemical cues released by a predator or from its prey. When threat of predation is high, prey often respond by altering their behavior to reduce their probability of detection and/or capture. Here, we test how a clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), behaviorally responds to predation cues. We measured aggressive and social behaviors both under 'risk', where chemical cues from predatory fish and injured conspecifics were present, and control contexts (no risk cues present). We predicted that mollies would exhibit reduced aggression towards a simulated intruder and increased sociability under risk contexts as aggression might increase their visibility to a predator and shoaling should decrease their chance of capture through the dilution effect. As predicted, we found that Amazon mollies spent more time with a conspecific when risk cues were present, however they did not reduce their aggression. This highlights the general result of the 'safety in numbers' behavioral response that many small shoaling species exhibit, including these clonal fish, which suggests that mollies may view this response as a more effective anti-predator response compared to limiting their detectability by reducing aggressive conspecific interactions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the maintenance of individual differences in behavior and physiology is a fundamental goal in ecology and evolution. The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis is often invoked to explain the maintenance of such within-population variation. This hypothesis predicts that behavioral traits are part of a suite of correlated traits that collectively determine an individual's propensity to prioritize reproduction or survival. A key assumption of this hypothesis is that these traits are underpinned by genetic trade-offs among life-history traits: genetic variants that increase fertility, reproduction and growth might also reduce lifespan. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence for the existence of genetic trade-offs between five key life-history traits: survival, growth rate, body size, maturation rate, and fertility. Counter to our predictions, we found an overall positive genetic correlation between survival and other life-history traits and no evidence for any genetic correlations between the non-survival life-history traits. This finding was generally consistent across pairs of life-history traits, sexes, life stages, lab vs. field studies, and narrow- vs. broad-sense correlation estimates. Our study highlights that genetic trade-offs may not be as common, or at least not as easily quantifiable, in animals as often assumed.",

    "abstract": "Collective behaviours, such as flocking in birds or decision making by bee colonies, are some of the most intriguing behavioural phenomena in the animal kingdom. The study of collective behaviour focuses on the interactions between individuals within groups, which typically occur over close ranges and short timescales, and how these interactions drive larger scale properties such as group size, information transfer within groups and group-level decision making. To date, however, most studies have focused on snapshots, typically studying collective behaviour over short timescales up to minutes or hours. However, being a biological trait, much longer timescales are important in animal collective behaviour, particularly how individuals change over their lifetime (the domain of developmental biology) and how individuals change from one generation to the next (the domain of evolutionary biology). Here, we give an overview of collective behaviour across timescales from the short to the long, illustrating how a full understanding of this behaviour in animals requires much more research attention on its developmental and evolutionary biology. Our review forms the prologue of this special issue, which addresses and pushes forward understanding the development and evolution of collective behaviour, encouraging a new direction for collective behaviour research. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Collective behaviour through time'.",

    "abstract": "Variation between individuals is a key component of selection and hence evolutionary change. Social interactions are important drivers of variation, potentially making behaviour more similar (i.e., conform) or divergent (i.e., differentiate) between individuals. While documented across a wide range of animals, behaviours and contexts, conformity and differentiation are typically considered separately. Here, we argue that rather than independent concepts, they can be integrated onto a single scale that considers how social interactions drive changes in interindividual variance within groups: conformity reduces variance within groups while differentiation increases it. We discuss the advantages of placing conformity and differentiation at different ends of a single scale, allowing for a deeper understanding of the relationship between social interactions and interindividual variation.",

Previous studies of Taravana syndrome in Polynesian pearl divers, which have similarities to decompression illness following breath-hold diving, and of Chiyamai in Japanese breath-hold divers, which have symptoms like panic disorder, show what modern medicine can learn from the wisdom of tradition. Among Japanese traditional breath-hold divers, known as Ama, in the Shima region, there is frightening folklore about something called Tomokazuki, a phantom-like figure that appears to an Ama in life-threatening situations. Although Tomokazuki may be a medically explainable phenomenon, to date it has not been analyzed scientifically. We review neuropsychiatric manifestations in traditional breath-hold divers, with a particular focus on Iwata Junichi's Ama of Shima, published in 1939, which records the traditional fishing practices of the Ama and includes 12 orally passed down episodes concerning Tomokazuki. Seven of the 12 Tomokazuki episodes were self-like visions, four were visions of others, and the remaining one was an auditory experience of a voice. Three episodes described feelings of being separated by a netlike membrane (similar to mosquito netting). Hypothermia, loss of consciousness due to hypoxia, sensory deprivation, isolation, and exhaustion were presumed to relate to the hallucinatory events both individually and in combination. The contents of hallucinations in similar occupational, sport, and clinical situations have not been well researched. Tomokazuki deserves attention from sociological and medical perspectives.",

    "issued": "2024-06",
    "abstract": "Earthquake nowcasting has been proposed as a means of tracking the change in large earthquake potential in a seismically active area. The method was developed using observable seismic data, in which probabilities of future large earthquakes can be computed using Receiver Operating Characteristic methods. Furthermore, analysis of the Shannon information content of the earthquake catalogs has been used to show that there is information contained in the catalogs, and that it can vary in time. So an important question remains, where does the information originate? In this paper, we examine this question using stochastic simulations of earthquake catalogs. Our catalog simulations are computed using an Earthquake Rescaled Aftershock Seismicity (“ERAS”) stochastic model. This model is similar in many ways to other stochastic seismicity simulations, but has the advantage that the model has only 2 free parameters to be set, one for the aftershock (Omori-Utsu) time decay, and one for the aftershock spatial migration away from the epicenter. Generating a simulation catalog and fitting the two parameters to the observed catalog such as California takes only a few minutes of wall clock time. While clustering can arise from random, Poisson statistics, we show that significant information in the simulation catalogs arises from the “non-Poisson” power-law aftershock clustering, implying that the practice of de-clustering observed catalogs may remove information that would otherwise be useful in forecasting and nowcasting. We also show that the nowcasting method provides similar results with the ERAS model as it does with observed seismicity.",

    "abstract": "Advancing the capabilities of earthquake nowcasting, the real-time forecasting of seismic activities, remains crucial for reducing casualties. This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, the existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures; each focuses on a different aspect of data, such as spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovative approaches called Multi Foundation Quake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California. Earthquake time series are generated using the logarithm energy released by quakes, spanning 1986 to 2024. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a novel method, Multi Foundation Quake, that achieves the best overall performance by combining a bespoke pattern with Foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams.",

    "abstract": "The Geysers geothermal field in California is experiencing land subsidence due to the seismic and geothermal activities taking place. This poses a risk not only to the underlying infrastructure but also to the groundwater level which would reduce the water availability for the local community. Because of this, it is crucial to monitor and assess the surface deformation occurring and adjust geothermal operations accordingly. In this study, we examine the correlation between the geothermal injection and production rates as well as the seismic activity in the area, and we show the high correlation between the injection rate and the number of earthquakes. This motivates the use of this data in a machine learning model that would predict future deformation maps. First, we build a model that uses interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images that have been processed and turned into a deformation time series using LiCSBAS, an open-source InSAR time series package, and evaluate the performance against a linear baseline model. The model includes both convolutional neural network (CNN) layers as well as long short-term memory (LSTM) layers and is able to improve upon the baseline model based on a mean squared error metric. Then, after getting preprocessed, we incorporate the geothermal data by adding them as additional inputs to the model. This new model was able to outperform both the baseline and the previous version of the model that uses only InSAR data, motivating the use of machine learning models as well as geothermal data in assessing and predicting future deformation at The Geysers as part of hazard mitigation models which would then be used as fundamental tools for informed decision making when it comes to adjusting geothermal operations.",

    "abstract": "The last 12 months have provided further evidence of the potential for cascading ecological and socio-political crises that were warned of 12 months ago. Then a consensus statement from the Regional Action on Climate Change Symposium warned: \"the Earth's climatic, ecological, and human systems are converging towards a crisis that threatens to engulf global civilization within the lifetimes of children now living.\" Since then, the consequences of a broad set of extreme climate events (notably droughts, floods, and fires) have been compounded by interaction with impacts from multiple pandemics (including COVID-19 and cholera) and the Russia-Ukraine war. As a result, new connections are becoming visible between climate change and human health, large vulnerable populations are experiencing food crises, climate refugees are on the move, and the risks of water, food, and climate disruption have been visibly converging and compounding. Many vulnerable populations now face serious challenges to adapt. In light of these trends, this year, RACC identifies a range of measures to be taken at global and regional levels to bolster the resilience of these populations in the face of such emerging crises. In particular, at all scales, there is a need for globally available local data, reliable analytic techniques, community capacity to plan adaptation strategies, and the resources (scientific, technical, cultural, and economic) to implement them. To date, the rate of growth of the support for climate change resilience lags behind the rapid growth of cascading and converging risks. As an urgent message to COP27, it is proposed that the time is now right to devote much greater emphasis, global funding, and support to the increasing adaptation needs of vulnerable populations.",

    "issued": "2023-02",
    "abstract": "Yes. Plain Language Summary The question of whether earthquake occurrence is random in time, or perhaps chaotic with order hidden in the chaos, is of major importance to the determination of risk from these events. It was shown many years ago that if aftershocks are removed from the earthquake catalogs, what remains are apparently events that occur at random time intervals, and therefore not predictable in time. In the present work, we enlist machine learning methods using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. With these methods, probabilities of large events and their associated information value can be computed. Here information value is defined using Shannon entropy, shown by Claude Shannon to define the surprise value of a communication such as a string of computer bits. Random messages can be shown to have high entropy, surprise value, or uncertainty, whereas low entropy is associated with reduced uncertainty and high reliability. An earthquake nowcast probability associated with reduced uncertainty and greater reliability is most desirable. Examples of the latter could be the statements that there is a 90% probability of a major earthquake within 3 years, or a 5% chance of a major earthquake within 1 year. Despite the random intervals between major earthquakes, we find that it is possible to make low uncertainty, high reliability statements on current hazard by the use of machine learning methods using catalog data from 1970-present.",

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: NMDARs are glutamate-gated cation channels that are key regulators of neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity and unique in their requirement for binding of a co-agonist (e.g. d -serine) in order for the channel to open. NMDARs have been found to drive synaptic plasticity via non-ionotropic (ion flux-independent) signaling upon the binding of glutamate in the absence of co-agonist, though conflicting results have led to controversy. Here, we found that d -serine inhibits non-ionotropic NMDAR-mediated LTD and LTD-associated spine shrinkage. Thus, a major source of the contradictory findings might be attributed to experimental variability in d -serine availability. In addition, the developmental regulation of d -serine levels suggests a role for non-ionotropic NMDAR plasticity during critical periods of plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelic compounds have displayed antidepressant potential in both humans and rodents. Despite their promise, psychedelics can induce undesired effects that pose safety concerns and limit their clinical scalability. The rational development of optimized psychedelic-related medicines will require a full mechanistic understanding of how these molecules produce therapeutic effects. While the hallucinogenic properties of psychedelics are generally attributed to activation of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs), it is currently unclear if these receptors also mediate their antidepressant effects as several nonhallucinogenic analogues of psychedelics with antidepressant-like properties have been developed. Moreover, many psychedelics exhibit promiscuous pharmacology, making it challenging to identify their primary therapeutic target(s). Here, we use a combination of pharmacological and genetic tools to demonstrate that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is essential for tryptamine-based psychedelics to produce antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Our results suggest that psychedelic tryptamines can induce hallucinogenic and therapeutic effects through activation of the same receptor.",

    "abstract": "The proper development and function of telencephalic GABAergic interneurons is critical for maintaining the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in cortical circuits. Glutamate contributes to cortical interneuron (CIN) development via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). NMDAR activation requires the binding of a co-agonist, either glycine or D-serine. D-serine (co-agonist at many mature forebrain synapses) is racemized by the neuronal enzyme serine racemase (SR) from L-serine. We utilized constitutive SR knockout (SR-/-) mice to investigate the effect of D-serine availability on the development of CINs and inhibitory synapses in the prelimbic cortex (PrL). We found that most immature Lhx6 + CINs expressed SR and the obligatory NMDAR subunit NR1. At embryonic day 15, SR-/- mice had an accumulation of GABA and increased mitotic proliferation in the ganglionic eminence and fewer Gad1 + (glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 kDa; GAD67) cells in the E18 neocortex. Lhx6 + cells develop into parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (Sst+) CINs. In the PrL of postnatal day (PND) 16 SR-/- mice, there was a significant decrease in GAD67+ and PV+, but not SST + CIN density, which was associated with reduced inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. These results demonstrate that D-serine availability is essential for prenatal CIN development and postnatal cortical circuit maturation.",

    "abstract": "Signaling via N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is critical for the maturation of glutamatergic synapses, partly through a developmental switch from immature synapses expressing primarily GluN2B- and GluN3A-containing subtypes to GluN2A-rich mature ones. This subunit switch is thought to underlie the synaptic stabilization of NMDARs necessary for neural network consolidation. However, the cellular mechanisms controlling the NMDAR exchange remain unclear. Using a combination of single-molecule and confocal imaging and biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we show that surface GluN3A-NMDARs form a highly diffusive receptor pool that is loosely anchored to synapses. Remarkably, changes in GluN3A subunit expression selectively alter the surface diffusion and synaptic anchoring of GluN2A- but not GluN2B-NMDARs, possibly through altered interactions with cell surface receptors. The effects of GluN3A on NMDAR surface diffusion are restricted to an early time window of postnatal development in rodents, allowing GluN3A subunits to control the timing of NMDAR signaling maturation and neuronal network refinements.",

    "abstract": "The effective reproduction number serves as a metric of population-wide, time-varying disease spread. During the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, this metric was primarily derived from case data, which has varied in quality and representativeness due to changes in testing volume, test-seeking behavior, and resource constraints. Deriving nowcasting estimates from alternative data sources such as wastewater provides complementary information that could inform future public health responses. We estimated county-aggregated, sewershed-restricted wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction numbers from May 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 for five counties in California with heterogeneous population sizes, clinical testing rates, demographics, wastewater coverage, and sampling frequencies. We used two methods to produce sewershed-restricted effective reproduction numbers, both based on smoothed and deconvolved wastewater concentrations. We then population-weighted and aggregated these sewershed-level estimates to arrive at county-level effective reproduction numbers. Using mean absolute error (MAE), Spearman's rank correlation (ρ), confusion matrix classification, and cross-correlation analyses, we compared the timing and trajectory of our two wastewater-based models to: (1) a publicly available, county-level ensemble of case-based estimates, and (2) county-aggregated, sewershed-restricted case-based estimates. Both wastewater models demonstrated high concordance with the traditional case-based estimates, as indicated by low mean absolute errors (MAE ≤ 0.09), significant positive Spearman correlation (ρ ≥ 0.66), and high confusion matrix classification accuracy (≥ 0.81). The relative timings of wastewater- and case-based estimates were less clear, with cross-correlation analyses suggesting strong associations for a wide range of temporal lags that varied by county and wastewater model type. This methodology provides a generalizable, robust, and operationalizable framework for estimating county-level wastewater-based effective reproduction numbers. Our retrospective evaluation supports the potential usage of real-time wastewater-based nowcasting as a complementary epidemiological tool for surveillance by public health agencies at the state and local levels. Based on this research, we produced publicly available wastewater-based nowcasts for the California Communicable diseases Assessment Tool (calcat.cdph.ca.gov).",

This study compares levels of non-specific VLPs across a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with levels of somatic coliphage, (F+) specific coliphage, Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), CrAssphage (CrAss), and Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV). All targets were quantified in influent, secondary-treated effluent, and tertiary-treated effluent at the University of California, Davis Wastewater Treatment Plant (UCDWWTP) over 11 weeks. We established an FVM-gating boundary for VLPs using bacteriophages T4 and ϕ6 as well as four phages isolated from wastewater. We then utilize T4 alongside three submicron beads as quality controls in the FVM assay. Coliphage was measured by standard plaque assays, and genome copies of PMMoV, CrAss, and ToBRFV were measured by digital droplet (dd)PCR. FVM results for wastewater revealed distinct microbial profiles at each treatment stage. However, correlations between VLPs and targeted viruses were poor. Trends for virus inactivation and removal, observed for targeted viruses during wastewater treatment, were consistent with expectations. Conversely, VLP counts were elevated in the WWTP effluent relative to the influent. Additional sampling revealed a decrease in VLP counts during the filtration treatment step following secondary treatment but a substantial increase in VLPs following ultraviolet disinfection. Defining application boundaries remain crucial to ensuring meaningful data interpretation as flow cytometry and virometry take on greater significance in water quality monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.1/BA.1.1) variant was declared a variant of concern (VOC) on November 26, 2021 and rapidly became the dominant lineage globally. Monitoring for VOCs is a public health priority, but standard case-based surveillance requires a robust, local whole genome sequencing (WGS) network and results may take weeks. Wastewater monitoring of VOCs is appealing as a potentially sensitive and timely approach to VOC monitoring that could provide complementary information to case-based WGS and a more complete picture of VOC circulation. However, wastewater VOC monitoring through PCR assays and WGS each have unique advantages and disadvantages that are not well characterized. The California Department of Public Health collaborated with academic partners to conduct wastewater VOC monitoring during the emergence of Omicron BA.1./BA.1.1 in late 2021. Wastewater monitoring was conducted via RT-PCR assays targeting specific mutations and via wastewater sequencing. Wastewater data was analyzed within the context of case-based WGS data to track the emergence of Omicron in California. In most locations across California, wastewater PCR provided early identification of the emergence and subsequent dominance of Omicron BA.1./BA.1.1. These results were then corroborated and confirmed as case-based WGS results became available. These data helped guide real-time public health response during the Omicron surge. Wastewater monitoring of VOC's provides a timely, accurate, and sensitive methodology for VOC monitoring. Successful implementation of wastewater VOC monitoring requires wastewater surveillance infrastructure as well as ongoing investment and research to support the development and deployment of assays and sequencing methodologies for emerging variants.",

    "issued": "2024-04",
    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and regions investigated the potential use of wastewater-based disease surveillance as an early warning system. Initially, methods were created to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Investigators have since conducted extensive studies to examine the link between viral concentration in wastewater and COVID-19 cases in areas served by sewage treatment plants over time. However, only a few reports have attempted to create predictive models for hospitalizations at a county-level based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater. This study implemented a linear mixed-effects model that evaluates the association between levels of virus in wastewater and county-level hospitalizations. The model was then utilized to predict short-term county-level hospitalization trends in 21 counties in California based on data from March 21, 2022, to May 21, 2023. The modeling framework proposed here permits repeated measurements, as well as fixed and random effects. The model that incorporated wastewater data as an input variable rather than cases or test positivity rate exhibited robust performance and effectively captured discernible trends in hospitalizations. Additionally, the model allows for the prediction of SARS CoV-2 hospitalizations two weeks ahead. Forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations could provide crucial information for hospitals to better allocate resources and prepare for potential surges in patient numbers.",

    "abstract": "Sub-city, or sub-sewershed, wastewater monitoring for infectious diseases offers a data-driven strategy to inform local public health response and complements city-wide data from centralized wastewater treatment plants. Developing strategies for equitable representation of diverse populations in sub-city wastewater sampling frameworks is complicated by misalignment between demographic data and sampling zones. We address this challenge by: (1) developing a geospatial analysis tool that probabilistically assigns demographic data for subgroups aggregated by race and age from census blocks to sub-city sampling zones; (2) evaluating representativeness of subgroup populations for COVID-19 wastewater-based disease surveillance in Davis, California; and (3) demonstrating scenario planning that prioritizes vulnerable populations. We monitored SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater as a proxy for COVID-19 incidence in Davis (November 2021-September 2022). Daily city-wide sampling and thrice-weekly sub-city sampling from 16 maintenance holes covered nearly the entire city population. Sub-city wastewater data, aggregated as a population-weighted mean, correlated strongly with centralized treatment plant data (Spearman's correlation 0.909). Probabilistic assignment of demographic data can inform decisions when adapting sampling locations to prioritize vulnerable groups. We considered four scenarios that reduced the number of sampling zones from baseline by 25% and 50%, chosen randomly or to prioritize coverage of >65-year-old populations. Prioritizing representation increased coverage of >65-year-olds from 51.1% to 67.2% when removing half the zones, while increasing coverage of Black or African American populations from 67.5% to 76.7%. Downscaling had little effect on correlations between sub-city and centralized data (Spearman's correlations ranged from 0.875 to 0.917), with strongest correlations observed when prioritizing coverage of >65-year-old populations.",

    "abstract": "In the early twentieth century, musicology was established as an academic discipline in the United States. Nonetheless, with the exception of Iberian medieval and Renaissance repertories, U.S. scholars largely overlooked the music of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world. Why should this have been the case, especially in light of Spain’s strong historical presence in the United States? This autobiographical essay examines this question by tracing the career of an individual musicologist, the Hispanist musicologist Carol A. Hess. Evaluated here are disciplinary shifts in U.S. musicology —methodological, philosophical, and ideological— over the past thirty years. These transformations have combined to make this repertory a viable field of study today. Musicologists in the United States can now make their careers by specializing in Iberian and Latin American music, as well as the music of the Hispanic diaspora. They research topics ranging from the avant-garde composer Llorenç Barber to the rapper Nach Scratch or the popular bandleader Xavier Cugat and his U.S. audiences of the 1940s, while others also pursue the time-tested areas of medieval and Renaissance music. Iberian and Latin American music is regularly offered in postsecondary institutions while instructors now have a variety of textbooks and other pedagogical resources from which to choose. All add up to a disciplinary freedom that would have been unthinkable only a few decades ago.",

Yet none has considered the tour in musical terms, nor taken into account Spanish reaction. Drawing on coverage in the Republican press, along with recent work on vocality and identity, I argue that the tour challenged prior notions of blackness in Spain. Spanish journalists addressed Robeson’s singing from the standpoint of the ‘suspect whiteness of Spain’ (to borrow Fra-Molinero’s apt description) while Robeson himself linked blackness and flamenco and reformulated the ‘sorrow song,’ as W. E. B. Du Bois called the spiritual. I also analyse Robeson’s performances of ‘Ol’ Man River’ from the musical Show Boat in terms of Republic ideology. In sum, Robeson challenged Franco’s vision of ‘blood purity’ (limpieza de sangre) while calling for racial justice worldwide.",

    "abstract": "To accommodate ever-growing traffic, network operators are actively deploying high-degree reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) to build large-capacity optical networks. High-degree ROADM-based optical networks have multiple parallel fibers between ROADM nodes, requiring the adoption of ROADM nodes with a large number of inter-/intra-node components. However, this large number of inter-/intra-node optical components in high-degree ROADM networks increases the likelihood of multiple failures simultaneously, and calls for novel methods for accurate localization of multiple failed components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the problem of multi-failure localization for high-degree ROADM-based optical networks. To solve this problem, we first provide a description of the failures affecting both inter-/intra-node components, and we consider different deployments of optical power monitors (OPMs) to obtain information (i.e., optical power) to be used for automated multi-failure localization. Then, as our main and original contribution, we propose a novel method based on a rules-informed neural network (RINN) for multi-failure localization, which incorporates the benefits of both rules-based reasoning and artificial neural networks (ANN). Through extensive simulations and experimental demonstrations, we show that our proposed RINN algorithm can achieve up to around 20% higher localization accuracy compared to baseline algorithms, incurring only around 4.14 ms of average inference time.",

    "abstract": "Multi-layer computing power networks (CPNs) are emerging as important information infrastructures and potential revenue streams for network operators. They support the exponential growth in computing demand by integrating ubiquitous computing resources within their IP/optical multi-layer networks. Efficient network slicing is essential for multi-layer CPNs. It enables multiple tenants (operators) to share resources flexibly and cost-effectively while fulfilling specific isolation criteria for service function chain (SFC) requests within each slice. The critical challenge here is making an efficient network slicing to share resources with tenants and simultaneously meet diverse SFC requirements. In this paper, we investigate a strategy for allocating slice resources among tenants with varying contributions. First, a contribution-weighted optimization (CWO) mechanism is introduced to hierarchically execute weighted optimization based on the contribution ratios of the tenants while fulfilling specific requirements. Second, an incremental request-oriented slice deployment framework, Once-For-All (OFA) is proposed to implement the CWO mechanism and dynamically construct slices by sequential decisions on the deployment of SFC requests. By applying an auxiliary cube (AC) to model the entire SFC deployment process in multi-layer CPNs, OFA enables the joint optimization of the deployment of all virtual nodes and links for each SFC. Furthermore, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to adaptively adjust the AC, accompanied by a heterogeneous graph attention network (HGAT) perceptron that distinguishes between rented and potential resources, thereby realizing the OFA-HGAT algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the proposed OFA-HGAT significantly benefits operators by reducing the contribution-weighted average power consumption by 15.8%, and enhancing the deployment performance for requests. Additionally, we show that OFA-HGAT exhibits robust generalization across various requests and networks.",

All-optical switching network has been promising for improving network flexibility and reducing resource waste. However, selecting optical circuit switching technology for diverse traffic may result in resource waste, whereas selecting optical timeslot switching may increase the network controlling costs. To solve this problem, we propose a traffic pattern identification and switching granularity selection scheme in network access interface using multiple switching granularities to fit the dynamic traffic pattern. Experiments show that the proposed scheme could decrease the number of wavelengths used by 10% and packet loss by 35%.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) rely on a large number of parameters and complex network structures, which require significant computational costs, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. In order to address the problems of lightweight deployment, we propose a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image recognition network based on graph neural networks. At first, we effectively reduce the computational cost of the network by designing the construction method of the graph structure and the aggregation formula of the graph network. Subsequently, a node-based attention mechanism is designed to extract structural features of the graph and enhance the network's recognition performance. Experimental results show that our proposed network achieves an accuracy improvement of 8.51 % compared to existing graph neural networks. Besides, compared to CNN and ViT, our network's training time is only 1/6, the number of parameters is 1/285, the FLOPs are 1/152, and the GPU memory usage is 1/5 with a decrease in accuracy of 0.84 %.

    "abstract": "This commentary highlights the limitations of many existing population-based studies examining the utility of the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised/Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F) in screening for autism. We expound on three major factors: (a) the limited number of screen-negative children who undergo diagnostic evaluations, (b) the substantial number of children who screen positive and were subsequently lost to follow-up (i.e. without further diagnostic evaluations), and (c) the sizeable number of children who did not complete the full two-stage screening process as intended. Each of these factors can lead to erroneous estimates of the psychometric properties, specifically, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value. Hence, we emphasize the need for future studies to increase the number of children who screen negative and receive a diagnostic evaluation and ensure that these children are selected at random without a higher likelihood for the presence of autism. It is also imperative that concrete steps are taken to minimize the number of screen-positive children who are lost to follow-up both within and after the screening process. Both of these will play a major role in ensuring more robust results from empirical research that can guide the clinical implementation of the M-CHAT-R/F.",

    "abstract": "The identification of novel genes underlying complex mouse behavioral traits remains an important step in understanding normal brain function and its dysfunction in mental health disorders. To identify dominant mutations that influence locomotor activity, we performed a mouse N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) forward mutagenesis screen and mapped several loci as quantitative traits. Here we describe the fine-mapping and positional cloning of a hyperactivity locus mapped to the medial portion of mouse chromosome four. We employed a modified recombinant progeny testing approach to fine-map the confidence interval from ≈20 Mb down to ≈5 Mb. Whole exome resequencing of all exons in this region revealed a single missense mutation in the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2 (Bai2). This mutation, R619W, is located in a critical extracellular domain that is a hotspot for mutations in this receptor class. We find that in two different mammalian cell lines, surface expression of Bai2 R619W is markedly reduced relative to wild-type Bai2, suggesting that R619W is a loss-of-function mutation. Our results highlight the powerful combination of ENU mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing to identify specific mutations that manifest as subtle behavioral phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Canine mammary tumours (CMT) are common in female dogs, often associated with malignancy and limited responses to conventional therapies. This study explores the potential of Auranofin (AF) in malignant CMT, focusing on its ability to induce distinct cell deaths. AF inhibited thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity, cell proliferation, and colony formation across malignant CMT cell lines, demonstrating significant anticancer effects. In AF-sensitive cell lines (CMT-U27, CHMm, and CHMp), 0.5-2 μM AF induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis, while concentrations above 3 μM caused near-complete cell death via additional proteasome inhibition. However, in AF-resistant cell lines (CIPp and CIPm), AF concentrations required for near-complete cell death were higher, expected to be challenging to achieve clinically. Therefore, we combined sublethal doses of AF (~2 μM) with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Bz) in these cells. The combination exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity and induced extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation. Live-cell staining revealed the ER origin of vacuoles, and cycloheximide pretreatment inhibited both vacuolation and AF + Bz-induced cell death, indicating features of paraptosis. While apoptosis could not be excluded, it was classified as paraptosis-like cell death occurring concurrently with apoptosis. Further analysis supported that this cell death is related to enhanced ER stress from AF-induced TrxR inhibition and Bz-induced proteasome inhibition. Based on these findings, we propose AF alone or combined with Bz as a promising therapeutic strategy for malignant CMT. Our findings highlight AF's potential to induce ER stress-mediated apoptosis and paraptosis-like cell death in canine cancer cells, expanding therapeutic options for targeting cancers in dogs.",

    "issued": "2025-04-01",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, treatments, complications, and outcomes in dogs with nasal planum squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) undergoing local treatment. METHODS: A retrospective, multi-institutional study was performed. Medical records were searched to identify dogs diagnosed with nasal planum SCC. Variables were recorded from medical records and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: 89 dogs were included. The most common presenting complaint was a visible mass on the nasal planum (89%). Metastasis was detected in 12% of dogs at the time of local therapy. Local therapy consisted of surgical excision alone in 63 of 89 dogs (71%) and radiation therapy alone in 20 of 89 dogs (22%); 6 dogs had multiple local therapies. Tumor size decreased in 12 dogs (60%) undergoing radiation therapy alone. Local recurrence was reported in 19 of 89 dogs (21%), including 16 of 63 dogs (25%) treated with surgery alone. Median survival time of all dogs was 452 days (95% CI, 285 to 576). Median survival time among 33 dogs with documented disease progression was 336 days (95% CI, 189 to 458), versus 685 days (95% CI, 334 to 1,042) in 56 dogs that did not have documented disease progression, which was significantly different (P = .038). Documented disease progression was significantly associated with hazard of death (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.63; P = .041). CONCLUSIONS: Dogs undergoing local treatment of nasal planum SCC had a favorable prognosis. Metastasis at the time of treatment was uncommon. Long-term survival was possible, particularly in cases without disease progression. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Aggressive local therapy, particularly surgical resection, should be considered in dogs with nasal planum SCC.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in long-lived human populations have led to identification of variants associated with Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease, the latter being the most common cause of mortality in people worldwide. In contrast, naturally occurring cancer represents the leading cause of death in pet dogs, and specific breeds like the Golden Retriever (GR) carry up to a 65% cancer-related death rate. We hypothesized that GWAS of long-lived GRs might lead to the identification of genetic variants capable of modifying longevity within this cancer-predisposed breed. A GWAS was performed comparing GR dogs ≥ 14 years to dogs dying prior to age 12 which revealed a significant association to ERBB4, the only member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family capable of serving as both a tumor suppressor gene and an oncogene. No coding variants were identified, however, distinct haplotypes in the 5'UTR were associated with reduced lifespan in two separate populations of GR dogs. When all GR dogs were analyzed together (n = 304), the presence of haplotype 3 was associated with shorter survival (11.8 years vs. 12.8 years, p = 0.024). GRs homozygous for haplotype 3 had the shortest survival, and GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 had the longest survival (11.6 years vs. 13.5 years, p = 0.0008). Sub-analyses revealed that the difference in lifespan for GRs carrying at least 1 copy of haplotype 3 was specific to female dogs (p = 0.009), whereas survival remained significantly different in both male and female GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 or haplotype 3 (p = 0.026 and p = 0.009, respectively). Taken together, these findings implicate a potential role for ERBB4 in GR longevity and provide evidence that within-breed canine lifespan studies could serve as a mechanism to identify favorable or disease-modifying variants important to the axis of aging and cancer.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously showed worse outcomes among lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups following metabolic/bariatric surgery (MBS). In light of healthcare changes in response to COVID-19, this study aims to evaluate post-pandemic MBS outcomes and determine if prior socioeconomic disparities persisted in the post-COVID era. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between 2015 and 2022 was performed. Patients were stratified into pre- and post-COVID groups. Post-COVID cohort was further stratified into high (HT) and low (LT) tier status based on Distressed Communities Index, a geocoded composite measure of SES. Preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared between pre- and post-COVID cohorts, as well as between post-COVID HT and LT groups. RESULTS: Of 709 patients, 82.9% were pre-COVID and 17.1% were post-COVID. Post-COVID cohort had greater rate of public insurance (46% vs. 37%, p < 0.001), longer wait time to surgery (mean 358 ± 609.8 days vs 241.9 ± 368.5 days, p = 0.045), and were more likely to undergo RYGB (69% vs. 56%, p = 0.010). Post-COVID patients also had lower risk of any complications on multivariable analysis (OR 0.599, 95% CI 0.372-0.963), had higher follow-up rates at post-discharge (95.8% vs 79.7%, p < 0.005), 6-month (93% vs. 82%, p < 0.001) and 12-month visits (75% vs. 63%, p = 0.005), and lost more weight at 12 months (67% excess weight loss (%EWL) vs. 58%EWL, p = 0.002). Among post-COVID HT and LT cohorts, previously seen disparities in complications were no longer seen. Finally, there were no differences in weight or follow-up rates between post-COVID HT and LT. CONCLUSIONS: Post-COVID changes to MBS care have resulted in improved short-term outcomes and reduced disparities for patients of lower SES. Further studies are needed to identify these positive factors to perpetuate practice patterns that optimize care for patients of all socioeconomic status.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES) is multifactorial, and its effect on post-bariatric weight recurrence is unclear. Distressed Community Index (DCI) is a composite SES score measuring community economic well-being. This study aims to evaluate the effect of DCI on long-term post-bariatric weight outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy between 2015 and 2020 was performed. All weights in the electronic medical record (EMR), including non-bariatric visits, were captured. Patients were stratified into low tier (LT) and high tier (HT) DCI groups. RESULTS: Of 583 patients, 431 (73.9%) were HT and 152 (26.1%) were LT. Average bariatric follow up was 1.78 ± 1.6 years and average postoperative weight in the EMR was 3.96 ± 2.26 years. Rates of bariatric follow up within the last year were similar (13.8% LT vs 16.2% HT, p = 0.47). LT had higher percent total body weight loss (%TWL; 26% LT vs 23% HT, p < 0.01) and percent excess weight loss (%EWL; 62% vs 57%, p = 0.04) at 1 year on univariate analysis. On multivariate linear regression adjusting for baseline characteristics and surgery type, there were no differences in %EWL between groups at 1 year (p = 0.22), ≥ 3 years (p = 0.53) or ≥ 5 years (p = 0.34) postop. While on univariate analysis LT only trended towards greater percentage of patients with > 15% increase from their 1-year weight (33.3% LT vs 21.0% HT, p = 0.06), on multivariate analysis this difference was significant (OR 2.0, LT 95%CI 1.41-2.84). There were no differences in the percentage of patients with > 15% decrease in %EWL from 1 to 3 + years postop between groups (OR 0.98, LT 95% CI 0.72-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: While low tier patients had similar weight loss at 1 year, they were twice as likely to have weight recurrence at ≥ 3 years. Further studies are needed to identify factors contributing to greater weight recurrence among this population.",

A promising alternative strategy for DNA targeting is the direct biosensing of user-defined sequences at single copy with single-cell resolution. Our recently described DNA biosensing approach using a dual fusion protein biosensor comprised of two independently optimized fragments of NanoLuc luciferase (NLuc) directionally fused to dCas9 paired with user-defined single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) could allow users to sensitively detect unique copies of a target sequence in individual living cells using common laboratory equipment such as a microscope or a luminescence-equipped microplate reader.

This study investigates N2G's role in nucleocytoskeletal coupling, a process critical for cellular function and development. We uncover multiple roles for N2G, including its activity as an F-actin bundler, an adapter that activates kinesin-1 motors, and a mediator of cytoskeletal cross-talk. Notably, N2G directly links kinesin-1 to F-actin, enabling the transport of actin filaments along microtubule tracks, establishing active cross-talk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. These findings provide crucial insights into nuclear movement, advancing our understanding of fundamental cellular processes and their implications in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear migration through narrow constrictions is important for development, metastasis, and proinflammatory responses. Studies performed in tissue culture cells have implicated linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes, microtubule motors, the actin cytoskeleton, and nuclear envelope repair machinery as important mediators of nuclear movements through constricted spaces. However, little is understood about how these mechanisms operate to move nuclei in vivo. In Caenorhabditis elegans larvae, six pairs of hypodermal P cells migrate from lateral to ventral positions through a constricted space between the body wall muscles and the cuticle. P-cell nuclear migration is mediated in part by LINC complexes using a microtubule-based pathway and by an independent CDC-42/actin-based pathway. However, when both LINC complex and actin-based pathways are knocked out, many nuclei still migrate, suggesting the existence of additional pathways. Here, we show that FLN-2 functions in a third pathway to mediate P-cell nuclear migration. The predicted N-terminal actin-binding domain in FLN-2 that is found in canonical filamins is dispensable for FLN-2 function; this and structural predictions suggest that FLN-2 does not function as a filamin. The immunoglobulin-like repeats 4-8 of FLN-2 were necessary for P-cell nuclear migration. Furthermore, in the absence of the LINC complex component unc-84, fln-2 mutants had an increase in P-cell nuclear rupture. We conclude that FLN-2 functions to maintain the integrity of the nuclear envelope in parallel with the LINC complex and CDC-42/actin-based pathways to move P-cell nuclei through constricted spaces.",

In budding yeast, pairing depends on the formation of 150-200 Spo11-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are distributed among 16 homolog pairs, but it is not known if all, or only a subset of these DSBs, contribute to the close juxtaposition of homologs. Having established a system to measure the position of fluorescently tagged chromosomal loci in 3D space over time, we analyzed locus trajectories to determine how frequently, and how long, loci spend colocalized or apart. Continuous imaging revealed highly heterogeneous cell-to-cell behavior of foci, with the majority of cells exhibiting a “mixed” phenotype where foci move into and out of proximity, even at late stages of prophase, suggesting that the axial structures of the synaptonemal complex may be more dynamic than anticipated. The observed plateaus of the mean-squared change in distance (MSCD) between foci informed the development of a biophysical model of two diffusing polymers that captures the loss of centromere linkages as cells enter meiosis, nuclear confinement, and the formation of Spo11-dependent linkages. The predicted number of linkages per chromosome in our theoretical model closely approximates the small number (~2-4) of estimated synapsis-initiation sites, suggesting that excess DSBs have negligible effects on the overall juxtaposition of homologs. These insights into the dynamic in-terchromosomal behavior displayed during homolog pairing demonstrate the power of combining time-resolved<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>analysis with modeling at the granular level.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title><jats:p>Essential for sexual reproduction, meiosis is a specialized cell division required for the production of haploid gametes.

Here, we reveal that random diffusion and the placement of a small number of linkages are sufficient to establish the apparent “pairing” of homologs. We also show that colocalization between any two loci is more dynamic than anticipated.

    "abstract": "The Hsp90 molecular chaperones are ATP-dependent enzymes that maintain protein homeostasis and regulate many essential cellular processes. Higher eukaryotes have organelle-specific Hsp90 paralogs that are adapted to each subcellular environment. The mitochondrial Hsp90, TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), supports the folding and activity of electron transport components and is increasingly appreciated as a critical player in mitochondrial signaling. Calcium plays a well-known and important regulatory role in mitochondria where it can accumulate to much higher concentrations than in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, we found here that calcium can replace magnesium, the essential enzymatic cofactor, to support TRAP1 ATPase activity. Anomalous X-ray diffraction experiments revealed a calcium-binding site within the TRAP1 nucleotide-binding pocket located near the ATP α-phosphate and completely distinct from the magnesium-binding site adjacent to the β- and γ-phosphates. In the presence of magnesium, ATP hydrolysis by TRAP1, as with other Hsp90s, was noncooperative, whereas calcium binding resulted in cooperative hydrolysis by the two protomers within the Hsp90 dimer. The structural data suggested a mechanism for this cooperative behavior. Because of the cooperativity, at high ATP concentrations, ATPase activity was higher with calcium, whereas the converse was observed at low ATP concentrations. Integrating these observations, we propose a model in which the divalent cation choice can control switching between noncooperative and cooperative TRAP1 ATPase mechanisms in response to varying ATP concentrations. This switching may facilitate coordination between cellular energetics, mitochondrial signaling, and protein homeostasis via alterations in the TRAP1 ATP-driven cycle and its consequent effects on different mitochondrial clients.",

    "issued": "2017-01-20",
    "abstract": "Colloidal aggregates of small molecules are the most common artifact in early drug discovery, sequestering and inhibiting target proteins without specificity. Understanding their structure and mechanism has been crucial to developing tools to control for, and occasionally even exploit, these particles. Unfortunately, their polydispersity and transient stability have prevented exploration of certain elementary properties, such as how they pack. Dye-stabilized colloidal aggregates exhibit enhanced homogeneity and stability when compared to conventional colloidal aggregates, enabling investigation of some of these properties. By small-angle X-ray scattering and multiangle light scattering, pair distance distribution functions suggest that the dye-stabilized colloids are filled, not hollow, spheres. Stability of the coformulated colloids enabled investigation of their preference for binding DNA, peptides, or folded proteins, and their ability to purify one from the other. The coformulated colloids showed little ability to bind DNA. Correspondingly, the colloids preferentially sequestered protein from even a 1600-fold excess of peptides that are themselves the result of a digest of the same protein. This may reflect the avidity advantage that a protein has in a surface-to-surface interaction with the colloids. For the first time, colloids could be shown to have preferences of up to 90-fold for particular proteins over others. Loaded onto the colloids, bound enzyme could be spun down, resuspended, and released back into buffer, regaining most of its activity. Implications of these observations for colloid mechanisms and utility will be considered.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We have evidence-based strategies such as remote patient monitoring and digital health tools to improve hypertension outcomes. Still, we lack large-scale studies focusing on disseminating these practices into routine clinical care. This is especially important to study within safety-net healthcare settings that disproportionately care for marginalized patient populations. METHODS: We will conduct a hybrid type 1 implementation trial (2 × 2 factorial design) with 25 safety-net clinics across three of California's public healthcare delivery systems, enrolling 2500 English- and Spanish-speaking patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Clinics will be randomized to receive baseline training on best practices in remote monitoring for hypertension management vs. training plus ongoing practice facilitation to support its implementation. Patients within these clinics will be randomized to receive cellular-enabled blood pressure monitors and automatic text message reminders to check their blood pressure at home vs. receipt of the same monitors as well as additional support via individually tailored text message feedback and support for hypertension management. RESULTS: The primary outcome will be a change in systolic blood pressure collected during routine office visits. Secondary outcomes include changes in home blood pressure and patient-reported assessments of clinical care and medication adherence. Given the hybrid type I trial implementation, the primary implementation outcomes will be the adoption of intervention at the patient and clinic levels. DISCUSSION: The evidence from this trial will advance implementation-focused research on hypertension management, such as the essential combination of both patient- and clinic-facing intervention strategies.

    "issued": "2019-03",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient portals are becoming ubiquitous. Previous research has documented substantial barriers, especially among vulnerable patient subgroups such as those with lower socioeconomic status or limited health literacy (LHL). We tested the effectiveness of delivering online, video-based portal training to patients in a safety net setting. METHODS: We created an online video curriculum about accessing the San Francisco Health Network portal, and then randomized 93 English-speaking patients with 1+ chronic diseases to receive 1) an in-person tutorial with a research assistant, or 2) a link to view the videos on their own. We also examined a third, nonrandomized usual care comparison group. The primary outcome was portal log-in (yes/no) 3 to 6 months post-training, assessed via the electronic health record. Secondary outcomes were self-reported attitudes and skills collected via baseline and follow-up surveys. RESULTS: Mean age was 54 years, 51% had LHL, 60% were nonwhite, 52% were female, 45% reported fair/poor health, and 76% reported daily Internet use. At followup, 21% logged into the portal, with no differences by arm (P = .41), but this was higher than the overall clinic rate of 9% (P < .01) during the same time period. We found significant prepost improvements in self-rated portal skills (P = .03) and eHealth literacy (P < .01). Those with LHL were less likely to log in post-training (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both modalities of online training were comparable, and neither mode enabled a majority of vulnerable patients to use portals, especially those with LHL. This suggests that portal training will need to be more intensive or portals need improved usability to meaningfully increase use among diverse patients.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of out-of-pocket (OOP) cost on nonadherence to classes of cardiometabolic medications among patients with diabetes. DATA SOURCES/SETTING: Electronic health records from a large, health care delivery system for 223,730 patients with diabetes prescribed 842,899 new cardiometabolic medications during 2006-2012. STUDY DESIGN: Observational, new prescription cohort study of the effect of OOP cost on medication initiation and adherence. DATA COLLECTION: Adherence and OOP costs were based on pharmacy dispensing records and benefits. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Primary nonadherence (never dispensed) increased monotonically with OOP cost after adjusting for demographics, neighborhood socioeconomic status, Medicare, medical financial assistance, OOP maximum, deductibles, mail order pharmacy incentive and use, drug type, generic or brand, day's supply, and comorbidity index; 7 percent were never dispensed the new medication when OOP cost ≥$11, 5 percent with OOP cost of $1-$10, and 3 percent when the medication was free of charge (p < .0001). Higher OOP cost was also strongly associated with inadequate secondary adherence (≥20 percent of time without adequate medication). There was no clinically significant or consistent relationship between OOP costs and early nonpersistence (dispensed once, never refilled) or later stage nonpersistence (discontinued within 24 months). CONCLUSIONS: Cost-sharing may deter clinically vulnerable patients from initiating essential medications, undermining adherence and risk factor control.",

    "abstract": "Current eukaryotic replication models postulate that leading and lagging DNA strands are replicated predominantly by dedicated DNA polymerases. The catalytic subunit of the leading strand DNA polymerase ε, Pol2, consists of two halves made of two different ancestral B-family DNA polymerases. Counterintuitively, the catalytically active N-terminal half is dispensable, while the inactive C-terminal part is required for viability. Despite extensive studies of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains lacking the active N-terminal half, it is still unclear how these strains survive and recover. We designed a robust method for constructing mutants with only the C-terminal part of Pol2. Strains without the active polymerase part show severe growth defects, sensitivity to replication inhibitors, chromosomal instability, and elevated spontaneous mutagenesis. Intriguingly, the slow-growing mutant strains rapidly accumulate fast-growing clones. Analysis of genomic DNA sequences of these clones revealed that the adaptation to the loss of the catalytic N-terminal part of Pol2 occurs by a positive selection of mutants with improved growth. Elevated mutation rates help generate sufficient numbers of these variants. Single nucleotide changes in the cell cycle-dependent kinase gene, CDC28, improve the growth of strains lacking the N-terminal part of Pol2, and rescue their sensitivity to replication inhibitors and, in parallel, lower mutation rates. Our study predicts that changes in mammalian homologs of cyclin-dependent kinases may contribute to cellular responses to the leading strand polymerase defects.",

    "abstract": "Cancer genomes harbor numerous genomic alterations and many cancers accumulate thousands of nucleotide sequence variations. A prominent fraction of these mutations arises as a consequence of the off-target activity of DNA/RNA editing cytosine deaminases followed by the replication/repair of edited sites by DNA polymerases (pol), as deduced from the analysis of the DNA sequence context of mutations in different tumor tissues. We have used the weight matrix (sequence profile) approach to analyze mutagenesis due to Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) and two error-prone DNA polymerases. Control experiments using shuffled weight matrices and somatic mutations in immunoglobulin genes confirmed the power of this method. Analysis of somatic mutations in various cancers suggested that AID and DNA polymerases η and θ contribute to mutagenesis in contexts that almost universally correlate with the context of mutations in A:T and G:C sites during the affinity maturation of immunoglobulin genes. Previously, we demonstrated that AID contributes to mutagenesis in (de)methylated genomic DNA in various cancers. Our current analysis of methylation data from malignant lymphomas suggests that driver genes are subject to different (de)methylation processes than non-driver genes and, in addition to AID, the activity of pols η and θ contributes to the establishment of methylation-dependent mutation profiles. This may reflect the functional importance of interplay between mutagenesis in cancer and (de)methylation processes in different groups of genes. The resulting changes in CpG methylation levels and chromatin modifications are likely to cause changes in the expression levels of driver genes that may affect cancer initiation and/or progression.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant neoplasm of terminally differentiated immunoglobulin-producing B lymphocytes called plasma cells. MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy, and it poses a heavy economic and social burden because it remains incurable and confers a profound disability to patients. Despite current progress in MM treatment, the disease invariably recurs, even after the transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (ASCT). Biological processes leading to a pathological myeloma clone and the mechanisms of further evolution of the disease are far from complete understanding. Genetically, MM is a complex disease that demonstrates a high level of heterogeneity. Myeloma genomes carry numerous genetic changes, including structural genome variations and chromosomal gains and losses, and these changes occur in combinations with point mutations affecting various cellular pathways, including genome maintenance. MM genome instability in its extreme is manifested in mutation kataegis and complex genomic rearrangements: chromothripsis, templated insertions, and chromoplexy. Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat MM add another level of complexity because many of them exacerbate genome instability. Genome abnormalities are driver events and deciphering their mechanisms will help understand the causes of MM and play a pivotal role in developing new therapies.",

    "abstract": "Cancer genomes accumulate nucleotide sequence variations that number in the tens of thousands per genome. A prominent fraction of these mutations is thought to arise as a consequence of the off-target activity of DNA/RNA editing cytosine deaminases. These enzymes, collectively called activation induced deaminase (AID)/APOBECs, deaminate cytosines located within defined DNA sequence contexts. The resulting changes of the original C:G pair in these contexts (mutational signatures) provide indirect evidence for the participation of specific cytosine deaminases in a given cancer type. The conventional method used for the analysis of mutable motifs is the consensus approach. Here, for the first time, we have adopted the frequently used weight matrix (sequence profile) approach for the analysis of mutagenesis and provide evidence for this method being a more precise descriptor of mutations than the sequence consensus approach. We confirm that while mutational footprints of APOBEC1, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3G are prominent in many cancers, mutable motifs characteristic of the action of the humoral immune response somatic hypermutation enzyme, AID, are the most widespread feature of somatic mutation spectra attributable to deaminases in cancer genomes. Overall, the weight matrix approach reveals that somatic mutations are significantly associated with at least one AID/APOBEC mutable motif in all studied cancers.",

    "abstract": "Multiple lines of correlative evidence support a role for ANGEL2, a novel cancer-relevant RNA-binding protein, in the modulation of chemoresistance and cancer patient survival. However, to date, no study has determined a mechanism by which ANGEL2 modulates cancer progression, nor its role in chemoresistance. Herein, we demonstrate that loss of ANGEL2 leads to a substantial decrease of the key tumor suppressor protein TP53. We show that ANGEL2 directly interacts with EIF4E, the rate limiting protein in cap-dependent translation. This interaction abrogates the ability for the TP53 translation repressor RBM38 to interact with EIF4E thereby enhancing TP53 translation. Loss of ANGEL2 in cancer cell lines resulted in increased 2D and 3D spheroid cell growth, and resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide. With therapeutic potential, treatment with Pep7, a seven amino-acid peptide derived from ANGEL2, rescued wildtype TP53 expression and sensitized cancer cells to doxorubicin. Together, we conclude that ANGEL2 modulates the EIF4E-RBM38 complex to enhance wildtype TP53 translation, and further, the Pep7 peptide may be explored as a therapeutic strategy for cancers which harbor wildtype TP53 expression. Implications: Loss of ANGEL2 contributes to decreased wildtype TP53 translation promoting doxorubicin resistance which can be rescued via an ANGEL2-derived peptide.",

    "abstract": "Reintroduction of tumor-suppressive microRNA-7-5p (miR-7) that is depleted in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a new therapeutic approach, whereas previous studies mainly used miR-7 mimics chemoengineered in vitro. Here we aim to establish the pharmacological actions and therapeutic potential of novel bioengineered RNA bearing a payload miR-7 (BioRNA/miR-7) molecule produced in vivo. First, through confocal imaging and immunoblot studies, we revealed that BioRNA/miR-7 altered NSCLC cell mitochondrial morphology accompanied by the downregulation of known target genes, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitochondrial solute carrier family 25A37 (SLC25A37), and import inner membrane translocase subunit (TIM50). Second, through luciferase reporter and immunoblot studies, we validated mitochondrial acylglycerol kinase (AGK) as a new direct target for miR-7. Third, through real-time live-cell analyses, we revealed BioRNA/miR-7 to modulate mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic capacity. Fourth, live-cell and endpoint viability studies demonstrated that the combination of BioRNA/miR-7 with pemetrexed (PEM) elicited a strong synergistic effect to inhibit NSCLC cell growth, associated with an increased intracellular PEM accumulation, as quantified by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Finally, through in vivo therapy study using NSCLC patient-derived xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of BioRNA/miR-7 monotherapy and combination therapy with PEM to control tumor progression. Our collective works establish a role for miR-7 in NSCLC metabolism and PEM disposition and support our novel, in vivo produced BioRNA/miR-7-5p for molecular pharmacological research. Our findings further illustrate the potential of BioRNA/miR-7 plus PEM combination as a potential treatment to combat NSCLC tumor progression. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: MiR-7 is a tumor-suppressive microRNA depleted in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and in vitro chemoengineered miR-7 mimics were shown to inhibit tumor growth in NSCLC cell-derived xenograft mice. Here, a novel in vivo bioengineered miR-7 molecule, namely BioRNA/miR-7, was used to effectively control target gene expression and NSCLC cell metabolism. Furthermore, BioRNA/miR-7 was demonstrated to remarkably improve pemetrexed antitumor activity in NSCLC patient-derived tumor mice, supporting the role of miR-7 in NSCLC metabolism and potential for BioRNA/miR-7 to improve NSCLC therapy.",

    "abstract": "In prostate cancer (PCa), androgens upregulate tumorigenesis, whereas in benign tissue, the revival of androgen receptor (AR) signaling suppresses aggressive behaviors, suggesting therapeutic potential. Dogs, natural PCa models, often lack AR in PCa. We restored AR in dog PCa to investigate resultant characteristics. Three AR-null canine PCa lines (1508, Leo, 1258) were transfected with canine wild-type AR and treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In 1508, AR restoration decreased clonogenicity (p = 0.03), viability (p = 0.004), migration (p = 0.03), invasion (p = 0.01), and increased expression of the tumor suppressor NKX3.1, an AR transcriptional target (p = 0.001). In Leo, AR decreased clonogenicity (p = 0.04) and the expression of another AR transcriptional target FOLH1 (p < 0.001) and increased the expression of NKX3.1 (p = 0.01). In 1258, AR increased migration (p = 0.006) and invasion (p = 0.03). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker (Vimentin, N-cadherin, SNAIL1) expression increased with AR restoration in Leo and 1258 but not 1508; siRNA vimentin knockdown abrogated AR-induced 1258 migration only. Overall, 1508 showed AR-mediated tumor suppression; AR affected proliferation in Leo but not migration or invasion; and EMT and AR regulated migration and invasion in 1258 but not proliferation. This study highlights the heterogeneous nature of PCa in dogs and cell line-specific effects of AR abrogation on aggressive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The multifaceted chemo-immune resistance is the principal barrier to achieving cure in cancer patients. Identifying a target that is critically involved in chemo-immune-resistance represents an attractive strategy to improve cancer treatment. iRhom1 plays a role in cancer cell proliferation and its expression is negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration. Here we show that iRhom1 decreases chemotherapy sensitivity by regulating the MAPK14-HSP27 axis. In addition, iRhom1 inhibits the cytotoxic T-cell response by reducing the stability of ERAP1 protein and the ERAP1-mediated antigen processing and presentation. To facilitate the therapeutic translation of these findings, we develop a biodegradable nanocarrier that is effective in codelivery of iRhom pre-siRNA (pre-siiRhom) and chemotherapeutic drugs. This nanocarrier is effective in tumor targeting and penetration through both enhanced permeability and retention effect and CD44-mediated transcytosis in tumor endothelial cells as well as tumor cells. Inhibition of iRhom1 further facilitates tumor targeting and uptake through inhibition of CD44 cleavage. Co-delivery of pre-siiRhom and a chemotherapy agent leads to enhanced antitumor efficacy and activated tumor immune microenvironment in multiple cancer models in female mice. Targeting iRhom1 together with chemotherapy could represent a strategy to overcome chemo-immune resistance in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology constitutes a scientific domain focused on intentional redesign of organisms to confer novel functionalities or create new products through strategic engineering of their genetic makeup. Leveraging the inherent capabilities of nature, one may address challenges across diverse sectors including medicine. Inspired by this concept, we have developed an innovative bioengineering platform, enabling high-yield and large-scale production of biological small interfering RNA (BioRNA/siRNA) agents via bacterial fermentation. Herein, we show that with the use of a new tRNA fused pre-miRNA carrier, we can produce various forms of BioRNA/siRNA agents within living host cells. We report a high-level overexpression of nine target BioRNA/siRNA molecules at 100% success rate, yielding 3-10 mg of BioRNA/siRNA per 0.25 L of bacterial culture with high purity (>98%) and low endotoxin (<5 EU/μg RNA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that three representative BioRNA/siRNAs against GFP, BCL2, and PD-L1 are biologically active and can specifically and efficiently silence their respective targets with the potential to effectively produce downstream antiproliferation effects by PD-L1-siRNA. With these promising results, we aim to advance the field of synthetic biology by offering a novel platform to bioengineer functional siRNA agents for research and drug development.",

To test the protective nature of SAN ECMs under strain, rSANHTs and rLVHTs were transplanted onto the murine thoracic diaphragm to undergo constant cyclic strain. All strained-rSANHTs preserved automaticity, whereas 66% of strained-rLVHTs lost their automaticity. In contrast to the strained-rLVHTs, PCMs in strained-rSANHTs maintained high expression of key pacemaker genes (HCN4, TBX3, and TBX18).

Current differentiation protocols yield a heterogeneous cell population that includes pluripotent stem cells and different cardiac subtypes (pacemaking and contractile cells). The ability to purify these cells and obtain well-defined, controlled cell compositions is important for many downstream applications; however, there is currently no established and reliable method to identify hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and their subtypes. Here, we demonstrate that second harmonic generation (SHG) signals generated directly from the myosin rod bundles can be a label-free, intrinsic optical marker for identifying hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. A direct correlation between SHG signal intensity and cardiac subtype is observed, with pacemaker-like cells typically exhibiting ~70% less signal strength than atrial- and ventricular-like cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that pacemaker-like cells can be separated from the heterogeneous population by choosing an SHG intensity threshold criteria. This work lays the foundation for developing an SHG-based high-throughput flow sorter for purifying hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and their subtypes.",

However, the ArcLight expression, in all cases, relied on a high number of lentiviral vector-mediated random genome integrations (8-12 copy/cell), raising concerns such as gene disruption and alteration of global and local gene expression, as well as loss or silencing of reporter genes after differentiation. Here, we report the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 nuclease technique to develop a hiPSC line stably expressing ArcLight from the AAVS1 safe harbor locus. The hiPSC line retained proliferative ability with a growth rate similar to its parental strain. Optical recording with conventional epifluorescence microscopy allowed the detection of APs as early as 21 days postdifferentiation, and could be repeatedly monitored for at least 5 months. Moreover, quantification and analysis of the APs of ArcLight-CMs identified two distinctive subtypes: a group with high frequency of spontaneous APs of small amplitudes that were pacemaker-like CMs and a group with low frequency of automaticity and large amplitudes that resembled the working CMs. Compared with FluoVolt voltage-sensitive dye, although dimmer, the ArcLight reporter exhibited better optical performance in terms of phototoxicity and photostability with comparable sensitivities and signal-to-noise ratios. The hiPSC line with targeted ArcLight engineering design represents a useful tool for studying cardiac development or hiPSC-derived cardiac disease models and drug testing.",

    "abstract": "The cost of taking a drug to market can exceed $2 billion dollars. The escalating cost of drug discovery is a major motivating factor for seeking new methods to predict the safety and efficacy of new compounds as early as possible in the drug development process to avoid drug attrition during late phases of clinical trials or even the withdrawal of approved drugs. Cardiotoxicity accounts for nearly 30% of US post-marketing drug withdrawal and remains a major concern to the point where the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is focused on in vitro cardiotoxicity screening to minimize cardiac risks associated with drugs. A technique that can directly quantify interactions between drugs and cardiomyocytes without the interference from exogenous genetic or chemical labels would be highly beneficial for directly screening these new drugs. Our group has previously shown that second harmonic generation (SHG) signals generated from myosin filaments in cardiomyocytes can be used as a robust label-free optical technique for recording cell shortening dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution due to the ability of the myosin rod domains in heart muscle cells to emit the frequency-doubled light. The dynamics is recorded without adding any fluorescent labels that may otherwise affect and modify the natural cell contractility of the cell. In this study, we investigated the use of SHG microscopy for measuring drug-induced changes in cardiac cell contractility and discuss its feasibility as a tool for screening drugs and evaluating cardiotoxicity.",

In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of NODAL signaling by a specific NODAL inhibitor (SB431542) in the cardiac mesoderm differentiation stage downregulated PITX2c, a transcription factor that is known to inhibit the formation of the sinoatrial node in the left atrium during cardiac development. The resulting hiPSC-CMs were smaller in cell size, expressed higher pro-pacemaking transcription factors, TBX3 and TBX18, and exhibited pacemaking-like electrophysiological characteristics compared to control hiPSC-CMs differentiated from established Wnt-based protocol. The pacemaker-like subtype increased up to 2.4-fold in hiPSC-CMs differentiated with the addition of SB431542 relative to the control. Hence, Nodal inhibition in the cardiac mesoderm stage promoted pacemaker-like CM differentiation from hiPSCs. Improving the yield of human pacemaker-like CMs is a critical first step in the development of functional human cell-based biopacemakers.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and pilot the Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Services Fidelity Scale (CHRPS-FS). METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify evidence-based treatments for individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHRP). These findings were compared with the First-Episode Psychosis Services Fidelity Scale (FEPS-FS). Common items were retained, and others were added, modified, or deleted. Next, the Delphi process was conducted with 17 clinical and academic experts in CHRP care to determine consensus on the importance and validity of each item. Concurrently, the preliminary tool was piloted in eight coordinated specialty care (CSC) clinics serving individuals with CHRP. RESULTS: The literature review identified two components of CHRP care that were not detailed in the FEPS-FS and were added to the CHRPS-FS; furthermore, one FEPS-FS item was modified and six were removed. In the Delphi process, clinical and academic experts achieved a consensus of >80% in two rounds, with some changes in item wording and the addition of one item (stepped care approach). A CHRPS-FS assessment was successfully piloted in eight CSC clinics. The mean CHRPS-FS rating score was 3.96 (range 3.75-4.23), and the median proportion of items rated at good to high fidelity was 72% (range 66%-78%). CONCLUSIONS: The CHRP-FS is feasible to implement, has face validity based on expert consensus, can be completed in conjunction with a FEPS-FS assessment or alone, and captures variability across programs. The CHRPS-FS measures service delivery and is suitable for clinical trials, learning health care systems, and quality improvement efforts.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A prolonged first episode of psychosis (FEP) without adequate treatment is a predictor of poor clinical, functional, and health outcomes and significant economic burden. Team-based \"coordinated specialty care\" (CSC) for early psychosis (EP) has established effectiveness in promoting clinical and functional recovery. However, California's CSC program implementation has been unsystematic and could benefit from standardizing its processes and data collection infrastructure. To address this, we established a consortium of EP clinics across the state via a Learning Health Care Network (LHCN) framework to develop the Early Psychosis Intervention Network of California (EPI-CAL). EPI-CAL's LHCN developed a core battery of evidence-based measures for service users and family members and linked them together using a unique data collection and visualization application, Beehive. METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: EPI-CAL's LHCN collects, visualizes, and aggregates data at the individual and clinic level for EP programs across California via Beehive. Beehive was designed to: (1) collect outcomes data from service users receiving care at EP programs and their support persons, (2) provide the data to providers on a secure web-based dashboard to support measurement-based care, and (3) allow data to be used for program or research analysis. We will (1) determine the feasibility of implementing an LHCN across a diverse, decentralized network of early psychosis programs, (2) determine if the implementation of an LHCN increases the delivery of measurement-based care, and (3) determine if the implementation of measurement-based care is associated with significant improvements in key service user outcomes. EPI-CAL's network will contribute data to the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET) program. DISCUSSION: The current study aims to establish an LHCN of EP clinics in California that implements harmonized data collection using Beehive and assesses the feasibility of establishing such a network. Our goal is for this harmonized data collection approach to be used to inform decisions and develop learning opportunities for service users, staff, and administrators, and to improve outcomes for service users and their supporters in CSC care. Further, the data will enable programs and research teams to examine what elements of care lead to program success and improved treatment outcomes for service users.

    "abstract": "Peer support specialists (PSs) have mental health recovery experience and are hired to assist others with similar challenges. This study is among the first to characterize stress among PSs, compared to data on other groups. Seven hundred and thirty-eight PSs working in U.S. mental health settings completed a cross-sectional online survey that included the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Participants' scores were compared with those obtained in prior samples of nonreferred adults and nonpeer clinicians. Comparisons are stratified by PSs' level of current symptoms, assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory. As a group, PSs experienced low to moderate levels of general and work-related stress. PSs endorsed modestly lower levels of general stress (d = -.25) than a normative sample of community residents. Although PSs endorsed lower levels of secondary trauma (d = -.15) than social workers and greater emotional exhaustion (d = .13) than nonpeer clinicians, effect sizes are \"smaller than small.\" A small subgroup (21.6%) of PSs with significant current symptoms experienced substantially greater general stress, secondary trauma, and emotional exhaustion than comparisons (d = 0.77, 1.04, and 1.12, respectively); despite having work conditions similar to other PSs respondents. Overall, PSs appear no more susceptible to general stress and work-related stress than relevant comparison groups of community residents and clinicians. A small subgroup of PSs experience both significant stress and symptoms-as is the case in other populations, given the well-established association between these constructs. Implications for supporting PSs and other clinicians with periods of work stress are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Outpatient civil commitment (OCC) provisions, community treatment orders (CTOs) in Australia and Commonwealth nations, are part of mental health law worldwide. This study considers whether and by what means OCC provides statutorily required \"needed-treatment\" addressing two aspects of its legal mandate to protect the safety of self (exclusive of deliberate-self-harm) and others. METHOD: Over a 12.4-year period, records of hospitalized-psychiatric-patients, 11,424 with CTO-assignment and 16,161 without CTO-assignment were linked to police-records. Imminent-safety-threats included perpetrations and victimizations by homicides, rapes, assaults/abductions, and robberies. \"Need for treatment\" determinations were validated independently by Health of the Nations Scale (HoNOS) severity-score-profiles. Logistic regressions, with propensity-score- adjustment and control for 46 potential confounding-factors, were used to evaluate the association of CTO-assignment with occurrence-risk of perpetrations and victimizations. RESULTS: CTO-assignment was associated with reduced safety-risk: 17% in initial-perpetrations, 11% in initial-victimizations, and 22% for repeat-perpetrations. Each ten-community-treatment-days in interaction with CTO-assignment was associated with a 3.4% reduced-perpetration-risk. CTO-initiated-re-hospitalization was associated with a 13% reduced-initial-perpetration-risk, a 17% reduced-initial-victimization-risk, and a 22% reduced-repeat-victimization-risk. All risk-estimates appear to be the unique contributions of the CTO, CTO-initiated-re-hospitalization, or the provision of ten-community-treatment-days-i.e. after accounting for the influence of prior crimes and victimizations, ethnic-bias, neighborhood disadvantage and other between-group differences in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: CTO assignment's association with reduced criminal-victimization and perpetration-risk, in conjunction with requiring participation in needed-treatment via re-hospitalization and community-service, adds support to the conclusion that OCC is to some extent fulfilling its legal objectives related to protecting safety of self (exclusive of deliberate-self-harm), and others.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Advanced maternal age (AMA) is a known risk factor for pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism. However, it is unclear if underlying differences exist in the maternal coagulation profiles of AMA vs non-AMA women. The aim of this prospective observational study was to compare peripartum thromboelastography parameters of AMA and non-AMA women undergoing elective Cesarean delivery (CD). METHODS: We compared the peripartum thromboelastographic profiles of healthy AMA women (age > 35 yr) and non-AMA women (age ≤ 35 yr) undergoing elective CD under neuraxial anesthesia. Blood samples were drawn prior to CD and at 24 hr and 72 hr post-CD. At each time point, we assessed thromboelastographic and other standard laboratory coagulation indices. We used a linear mixed-effects regression model (SAS(®) PROC MIXED) to assess between-group differences for individual thromboelastographic and laboratory coagulation parameters. RESULTS: The median [interquartile range] ages of women were 38 [37-41] yr and 29 [25-34] yr in the AMA and non-AMA groups, respectively (P < 0.001). We observed no statistically significant effect of study group on any thromboelastographic or laboratory coagulation parameters. No statistically significant correlations were found between any thromboelastographic parameter and maternal age. Peripartum thromboelastography and coagulation profiles of healthy AMA and healthy non-AMA women up to 72 hr post-CD were also similar. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that maternal thromboelastographic profiles of healthy AMA and non-AMA women undergoing elective CD are similar. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01416454).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A massive transfusion protocol may offer major advantages for management of postpartum hemorrhage. The etiology of postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion outcomes and laboratory indices in obstetric cases requiring the massive transfusion protocol were retrospectively evaluated in a tertiary obstetric center. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of obstetric patients requiring the massive transfusion protocol over a 31-month period. Demographic, obstetric, transfusion, laboratory data and adverse maternal outcomes were abstracted. RESULTS: Massive transfusion protocol activation occurred in 31 patients (0.26% of deliveries): 19 patients (61%) had cesarean delivery, 10 patients (32%) had vaginal delivery, and 2 patients (7%) had dilation and evacuation. Twenty-six patients (84%) were transfused with blood products from the massive transfusion protocol. The protocol was activated within 2h of delivery for 17 patients (58%). Median [IQR] total estimated blood loss value was 2842 [800-8000]mL. Median [IQR] number of units of red blood cells, plasma and platelets from the massive transfusion protocol were: 3 [1.75-7], 3 [1.5-5.5], and 1 [0-2.5] units, respectively. Mean (SD) post-resuscitation hematologic indices were: hemoglobin 10.3 (2.4)g/dL, platelet count 126 (44)×10(9)/L, and fibrinogen 325 (125)mg/dL. The incidence of intensive care admission and peripartum hysterectomy was 61% and 19%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our massive transfusion protocol provides early access to red blood cells, plasma and platelets for patients experiencing unanticipated or severe postpartum hemorrhage. Favorable hematologic indices were observed post resuscitation. Future outcomes-based studies are needed to compare massive transfusion protocol and non-protocol based transfusion strategies for the management of hemorrhage.",

    "issued": "2011-10",
    "abstract": "Morphine is a drug commonly administered via the epidural or intrathecal route, and is regarded by many as the 'gold-standard' single-dose neuraxial opioid due to its postoperative analgesic efficacy and prolonged duration of action. However, respiratory depression is a recognized side effect of neuraxial morphine administered in the perioperative setting. We conducted an extensive review of articles published since 1945 that examine respiratory depression or failure associated with perioperative intrathecal or epidural morphine use. Respiratory depression was previously thought to result from the interaction of opioid in the cerebrospinal fluid with ventral medullary opioid receptors. More recently, the preBötzinger complex located in the medulla has been identified as the site responsible for the decrease in respiratory rate following systemic administration of opioids. Neurons in the preBötzinger complex expressing neurokinin-1 receptors are selectively inhibited by opioids, and therefore are the mediators of opioid-induced respiratory depression. Epidural, intrathecal and plasma pharmacokinetics of opioids are complex, vary between neuraxial compartments, and can even differ within the epidural space itself depending upon level of insertion. Caution should be exercised when prescribing systemic opioids (intravenous or oral) in addition to neuraxial morphine as this can compound the potential for early or delayed respiratory depression. There is a wide range of incidences for respiratory depression following neuraxial morphine in a perioperative setting. Disparity of definitions used for the diagnosis of respiratory depression in the literature precludes identification of the exact incidence of this rare event. The optimal neuraxial opioid dose is a balance between the conflicting demands of providing optimal analgesia while minimizing dose-related adverse effects. Dose-response studies show that neuraxial morphine appears to have an analgesic efficacy 'ceiling'. The optimal 'single-shot' intrathecal dose appears to be 0.075-0.15 mg and the ideal 'single-shot' epidural morphine dose is 2.5-3.75 mg. Analgesic efficacy studies have not been adequately powered to show differences in the incidence of clinically significant respiratory depression. Opioid antagonists such as naloxone to prevent or treat opioid-induced respiratory depression have a number of limitations. Researchers have recently focused on non-opioid drugs such as serotonin receptor agonists. Early evidence suggests that ampakine (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid [AMPA]) receptor modulators may be effective at reducing opioid-induced respiratory depression while maintaining analgesia. Sodium/proton exchanger type 3 (NHE3) inhibitors, which act centrally on respiratory pathways, also warrant further study.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE(S): The authors have developed an alternative dosing schedule for tranexamic acid that incorporates the effects of renal function on tranexamic acid concentrations. The objectives of this study were to determine if this new dosing schedule can achieve the desired plasma concentration of tranexamic acid and reduce intra- and interpatient variability in tranexamic acid plasma concentrations relative to the current dosing schedule. DESIGN: A prospective randomized trial. SETTING: A tertiary referral medical center hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Cardiac surgery patients. INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac surgery patients were randomly assigned to receive the authors' standard tranexamic acid loading dosage of 10 mg/kg given over 20 minutes, followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h (9 patients), or the new drug dosage schedule described later (11 patients). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Perioperative plasma tranexamic acid concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. From repeated-measures analysis of variance, a significant (p < 0.001) time-by-treatment interaction effect was detected indicating that differences in mean tranexamic acid concentration between treatment groups were dependent on time period. Among patients receiving the standard dosing regimen, those with renal insufficiency had lower tranexamic acid concentration at 5 minutes on cardiopulmonary bypass (p = 0.003). For patients receiving the experimental regimen, the mean tranexamic acid concentration did not differ significantly at any time point between patients with and without renal insufficiency (p > 0.20 at all time points). CONCLUSIONS: The new dosing protocol for tranexamic acid resulted in more consistent blood concentrations of tranexamic acid, but not stable tranexamic acid levels >20 microg/mL on cardiopulmonary bypass.",

    "issued": "2022-09-01",
    "abstract": "This Essay analyzes how aggressive activism in a California mountain town at the tail end of the nineteenth century commenced a chain reaction resulting in state and ultimately national anti-Chinese immigration laws. The constitutional immunity through which the Supreme Court upheld those laws deeply affected the future trajectory of U.S. immigration law and policy. Responding to sustained political pressure from the West, Congress in 1882 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, an infamous piece of unabashedly racist legislation that commenced a long process of barring immigration from all of Asia to the United States. In upholding the Act, the Supreme Court in an extraordinary decision that jars modern racial sensibilities declared that Congress possessed “plenary power”—absolute authority—over immigration and that racist immigration laws were immune from judicial review of their constitutionality. The bedrock of U.S. immigration jurisprudence for more than a century and never overruled by the Supreme Court, the plenary power doctrine permits the treatment of immigrants in racially discriminatory ways consistent with the era of Jim Crow but completely at odds with modern constitutional law. The doctrine enabled President Trump, a fierce advocate of tough-as-nails immigration measures, to pursue the most extreme immigration program of any modern president, with devastating impacts on noncitizens of color. As the nation attempts to grapple with the Trump administration’s brutal treatment of immigrants, it is an especially opportune historical moment to reconsider the plenary power doctrine. Ultimately, the commitment to remove systemic racism from the nation’s social fabric requires the dismantling of the doctrine and meaningful constitutional review of the immigration laws. That, in turn, would open the possibilities to the removal of systemic racial injustice from immigration law and policy.",

    "abstract": "Peptide hormones are essential signaling molecules with therapeutic importance. Identifying regulatory factors that drive their activity gives important insight into their mode of action and clinical development. In this work, we demonstrate the combined impact of Cu(II) and the serum protein albumin on the activity of C-peptide, a 31-mer peptide derived from the same prohormone as insulin. C-peptide exhibits beneficial effects, particularly in diabetic patients, but its clinical use has been hampered by a lack of mechanistic understanding. We show that Cu(II) mediates the formation of ternary complexes between albumin and C-peptide and that the resulting species depend on the order of addition. These ternary complexes notably alter peptide activity, showing differences from the peptide or Cu(II)/peptide complexes alone in redox protection as well as in cellular internalization of the peptide. In standard clinical immunoassays for measuring C-peptide levels, the complexes inflate the quantitation of the peptide, suggesting that such adducts may affect biomarker quantitation. Altogether, our work points to the potential relevance of Cu(II)-linked C-peptide/albumin complexes in the peptide's mechanism of action and application as a biomarker.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical manifestations of Wilson disease (WD) are related to copper accumulation in the liver and the brain, but little is known about other tissue involvement regarding metabolic changes in WD. In vitro studies suggested that the loss of intestinal ATP7B affects metabolic dysregulation in WD. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the gut microbiota and lipidome in 2 mouse models of WD and by characterizing a new mouse model with a targeted deletion of Atp7b in the intestine. METHODS: Cecal content 16S sequencing and untargeted hepatic and plasma lipidome analyses in the Jackson Laboratory toxic-milk and the Atp7b null global knockout mouse models of WD were profiled and integrated. Intestine-specific Atp7b knockout mice (Atp7bΔIEC) were generated and characterized using targeted lipidome analysis following a high-fat diet challenge. RESULTS: Gut microbiota diversity was reduced in animal models of WD. Comparative prediction analysis revealed amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism functions to be dysregulated in the WD gut microbial metagenome. Liver and plasma lipidomic profiles showed dysregulated triglyceride and diglyceride, phospholipid, and sphingolipid metabolism in WD models. However, Atp7bΔIEC mice did not show gut microbiome differences compared to wild type. When challenged with a high-fat diet, Atp7bΔIEC mice exhibited profound alterations to fatty acid desaturation and sphingolipid metabolism pathways as well as altered APOB48 distribution in intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiome and lipidome underlie systemic metabolic manifestations in murine WD. Intestine-specific ATP7B deficiency affected both intestinal and systemic response to a high-fat challenge but not the microbiome profile, at least at early stages. WD is a systemic disease in which intestinal-specific ATP7B loss and diet influence the phenotype and the lipidome profile.",

    "abstract": "Copper is an essential redox-active metal that plays integral roles in biology ranging from enzymatic catalysis to mitochondrial respiration. However, if not adequately regulated, this redox activity has the potential to cause oxidative stress through the production of reactive oxygen species. Indeed, the dysregulation of copper has been associated with a variety of disease states including diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and multiple cancers. While increasing tools are being developed for illuminating labile intracellular copper pools and the trafficking pathways in which they are involved, significantly less attention has been given to the analogous extracellular labile pool. To address this gap, we have developed a bioluminescence-based imaging probe, picolinic ester caged-diphenylterazine (pic-DTZ) for monitoring labile, extracellular copper using a coelenterazine-like imidazopyrazinone and the genetically-engineered, marine-based luciferase, nanoluciferase. Unlike the more commonly-used firefly luciferase, nanoluciferase does not require ATP, allowing its application to the extracellular milieu. pic-DTZ demonstrates high metal and oxidation state selectivity for Cu(ii) in aqueous buffer as well as selectivity for labile pools over coordinatively inaccessible protein-bound Cu(ii). We demonstrate the potential of pic-DTZ as a diagnostic tool in human serum and plasma for copper-associated diseases. Additionally, we apply pic-DTZ to lend insight into the extracellular copper dynamic in anticancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury has faced numerous challenges in drug development, primarily due to the difficulty of effectively delivering drugs to the brain. However, there is a potential solution in targeted drug delivery methods involving antibody-drug conjugates or nanocarriers conjugated with targeting antibodies. Following a TBI, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) becomes permeable, which can last for years and allow the leakage of harmful plasma proteins. Consequently, an appealing approach for TBI treatment involves using drug delivery systems that utilize targeting antibodies and nanocarriers to help restore BBB integrity. In our investigation of this strategy, we examined the efficacy of free antibodies and nanocarriers targeting a specific endothelial surface marker called vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is known to be upregulated during inflammation. In a mouse model of TBI utilizing central fluid percussion injury, free VCAM-1 antibody did not demonstrate superior targeting when comparing sham vs. TBI brain. However, the administration of VCAM-1-targeted nanocarriers (liposomes) exhibited a 10-fold higher targeting specificity in TBI brain than in sham control. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that VCAM-1 liposomes were primarily taken up by brain endothelial cells post-TBI. Consequently, VCAM-1 liposomes represent a promising platform for the targeted delivery of therapeutics to the brain following traumatic brain injury.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug overdose-related deaths continue to increase globally. Testing demands have likewise increased, prompting healthcare facilities to adopt a range of methods, from simple point-of-care immunoassays to comprehensive chromatographic and mass spectrometry-based techniques. Each of these testing methods has trade-offs related to cost, performance, speed, and convenience, requiring healthcare facilities to carefully determine the best options to meet their clinical needs. Unfortunately, current testing practices may result in unnecessary costs and certain methods, such as immunoassays, have significant limitations that affect their clinical utility. As such, the goal of this review is to frame the current state of drug testing and related cost-effectiveness and patient centered approaches to address this evolving public health challenge. CONTENT: This review discusses the current state of substance use mortality/morbidity, the economic impact of substance use disorders, provides an overview of testing methods and their relative cost-benefit, solutions to improve test utilization and cost-effectiveness, and finally, future threats and new opportunities that can improve the clinical utility of these tests. SUMMARY: The cost-effectiveness of drugs of abuse testing revolves around proper test utilization, including understanding what test is being ordered, its limitations, understanding results, and ordering testing when it can provide actionable information. Fundamental principles of test utilization such as education, clinical informatics, and optimizing test panels remain essential. Future threats in this space include new compounds and regulatory changes. However, novel solutions such as new noninvasive sample types, automation, and artificial intelligence can play a significant role in improving overall test utilization practices.",

    "abstract": "While current systems for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are safe and effective, there is a high degree of variability between readings within and across CGM systems. In current CGM performance studies, device readings are compared with glucose concentrations obtained with a comparator (\"reference\") measurement procedure (usually capillary or venous glucose). However, glucose concentrations from capillary and venous samples can systematically differ, often by as much as 5 to 10%. Different comparator methods have shown biases of up to 8%, and comparator devices of the same brand can systematically differ by more than 5%. To address these issues, the Working Group on CGM of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC WG-CGM) recommends standardizing study procedures and the comparator measurement process in CGM performance studies. The majority of IFCC WG-CGM members recommend the use of capillary samples as reference, mainly because CGM readings will then be aligned better with results from self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Even with factory-calibrated CGM systems, manufacturers require CGM users to perform SMBG in some situations, eg, manual calibration, confirmation of extreme readings, discordance between CGM readings and symptoms of hyper- or hypoglycemia, or intermittent signal loss. Comparator devices should meet defined analytical performance specifications for bias and imprecision. Comparator bias can be reduced by retrospective correction of comparator values based on measurements with a method or materials of higher metrological order. Once manufacturers align CGM readings of their systems with comparator results using standardized procedures, variability across CGM systems will be reduced.",

    "abstract": "Critical asthma syndrome represents the most severe subset of asthma exacerbations, and the critical asthma syndrome is an umbrella term for life-threatening asthma, status asthmaticus, and near-fatal asthma. According to the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines, a life-threatening asthma exacerbation is marked by an inability to speak, a reduced peak expiratory flow rate of  < 25 % of a patient's personal best, and a failed response to frequent bronchodilator administration and intravenous steroids. Almost all critical asthma syndrome cases require emergency care, and most cases require hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit. Among asthmatics, those with the critical asthma syndrome are difficult to manage and there is little room for error. Patients with the critical asthma syndrome are prone to complications, they utilize immense resources, and they incite anxiety in many care providers. Managing this syndrome is anything but routine, and it requires attention, alacrity, and accuracy. The specific management strategies of adults with the critical asthma syndrome in the hospital with a focus on intensive care are discussed. Topics include the initial assessment for critical illness, initial ventilation management, hemodynamic issues, novel diagnostic tools and interventions, and common pitfalls. We highlight the use of critical care ultrasound, and we provide practical guidelines on how to manage deteriorating patients such as those with pneumothoraces. When standard asthma management fails, we provide experience-driven recommendations coupled with available evidence to guide the care team through advanced treatment. Though we do not discuss medications in detail, we highlight recent advances.",

    "abstract": "Urgent visits to the clinic and emergency department for acute severe asthma exacerbations are all too frequent. Existing national guidelines do not present consistent or specific recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of individual asthma patients in respiratory distress. In this vein, we propose the term \"critical asthma syndrome\" (CAS) to describe any child or adult who is at high risk for fatal asthma. Acute severe asthma, refractory asthma, status asthmaticus, and near-fatal asthma all describe CAS where physical exhaustion from the overwhelming work of breathing leads to respiratory arrest and death from hypoxia or related complications. The authors of this supplement seek to emphasize the importance of early recognition, prompt and coordinated evaluation, and treatment of CAS in the emergency department, hospital, and intensive care units by experienced healthcare provider teams. CAS is not severe persistent asthma where control of symptoms and prevention of exacerbations are targets of chronic disease management in the outpatient setting. The authors address the distinctions between the two entities throughout the supplement, and elaborate on the considerations important in the care of a critically ill patient, including the common errors to avoid. In addition, gaps in knowledge and clinical experience in regards to critical asthma are highlighted. Knowledge gaps include a lack of understanding of how to recognize CAS, how to coordinate and integrate hospital and outpatient resources, when to further phenotype patients with critical asthma in order to facilitate effective treatment, and how to prevent future acute exacerbations. Lastly, CAS is complicated by the fact that asthma care in diverse healthcare settings is haphazard. We recommend that primary care physicians refer patients promptly to an asthma specialist for consultation to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and prevent the development of CAS.",

    "abstract": "The critical asthma syndrome (CAS) encompasses the most severe, persistent, refractory asthma patients for the clinician to manage. Personalized pharmacotherapy is necessary to prevent the next acute severe asthma exacerbation, not just the control of symptoms. The 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel 3 provides guidelines for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma. The patient’s response to recommended pharmacotherapy is highly variable which risks poor asthma control leading to frequent exacerbations that can deteriorate into CAS. Controlling asthma symptoms and preventing acute exacerbations may be two separate clinical activities with their own unique demands. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of asthma medications available but must concurrently be aware of potential drug toxicities some of which can paradoxically worsen asthma control. Medications normally prescribed for COPD can potentially be useful in the CAS patient, particularly those with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome. Immunomodulation with drugs like omalizumab in IgE-mediated asthma syndromes is one important approach. New and emerging drugs address unique aspects of airway inflammation and biology but at a significant financial cost. The pharmacology and toxicities of the agents that may be used in the treatment of CAS to control asthma symptoms and prevent severe exacerbations are reviewed.",

Yet, the efficacy of alternating electrical current stimulation in animal models of AD is unknown, and prior research has not addressed intensity-dependent effects. METHODS: The intensity-dependent effect of gamma electrical stimulation (GES) with a sinusoidal alternating current at 40 Hz on Aβ clearance and microglia modulation were assessed in 5xFAD mouse hippocampus and cortex, as well as the behavioral performance of the animals with the Morris Water Maze. RESULTS: One hour of epidural GES delivered over a month significantly (1) reduced Aβ load in the AD brain, (2) increased microglia cell counts, decreased cell body size, increased length of cellular processes of the Iba1 + cells, and (3) improved behavioral performance (learning & memory). All these effects were most pronounced when a higher stimulation current was applied. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of GES on the reduction of AD pathology and the intensity-dependent feature provide guidance for the development of this promising therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurogenesis is significantly impaired in the brains of both human patients and experimental animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although deep brain stimulation promotes neurogenesis, it is an invasive technique that may damage neural circuitry along the path of the electrode. To circumvent this problem, we assessed whether intracranial electrical stimulation to the brain affects neurogenesis in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used Ki67, Nestin, and doublecortin (DCX) as markers and determined that neurogenesis in both the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus were significantly reduced in the brains of 4-month-old 5xFAD mice. Guided by a finite element method (FEM) computer simulation to approximately estimate current and electric field in the mouse brain, electrodes were positioned on the skull that were likely to deliver stimulation to the SVZ and hippocampus. After a 4-week program of 40-Hz intracranial alternating current stimulation (iACS), neurogenesis indicated by expression of Ki67, Nestin, and DCX in both the SVZ and hippocampus were significantly increased compared to 5xFAD mice who received sham stimulation. The magnitude of neurogenesis was close to the wild-type (WT) age-matched unmanipulated controls. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that iACS is a promising, less invasive technique capable of effectively stimulating the SVZ and hippocampus regions in the mouse brain. Importantly, iACS can significantly boost neurogenesis in the brain and offers a potential treatment for AD.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) can be an effective non-invasive neuromodulation procedure. Unfortunately, the considerable variation in reported treatment outcomes, both within and between studies, has made the procedure unreliable for many applications. To determine if individual differences in cranium morphology and tissue conductivity can account for some of this variation, the electrical density at two cortical locations (temporal and frontal) directly under scalp electrodes was modeled using a validated MRI modeling procedure in 23 subjects (12 males and 11 females). Three different electrode configurations (non-cephalic, bi-cranial, and ring) commonly used in tES were modeled at three current intensities (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mA). The aims were to assess the effects of configuration and current intensity on relative current received at a cortical brain target directly under the stimulating electrode and to characterize individual variation. The different electrode configurations resulted in up to a ninefold difference in mean current densities delivered to the brains. The ring configuration delivered the least current and the non-cephalic the most. Female subjects showed much less current to the brain than male subjects. Individual differences in the current received and differences in electrode configurations may account for significant variability in current delivered and, thus, potentially a significant portion of reported variation in clinical outcomes at two commonly targeted regions of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Low current transcranial electrical stimulation (tCS) is an effective but somewhat inconsistent tool for augmenting neuromodulation. In this study, we used 3D MRI guided electrical transcranial stimulation modeling to estimate the range of current intensities received at cortical brain tissues. Combined T1, T2, and proton density MRIs from 24 adult subjects (12 male and 12 female) were modeled with virtual electrodes placed at F3, F4, C3, and C4. Two sizes of electrodes 20 mm round and 50 mm × 45 mm were examined at 0.5, 1, and 2 mA input currents. The intensity of current received was sampled in a 1-cm sphere placed at the cortex directly under each scalp electrode. There was a 10-fold difference in the amount of current received by individuals. A large gender difference was observed with female subjects receiving significantly less current at targeted parietal cortex than male subjects when stimulated at identical current levels (P < 0.05). Larger electrodes delivered somewhat larger amounts of current than the smaller ones (P < 0.01). Electrodes in the frontal regions delivered less current than those in the parietal region (P < 0.05). There were large individual differences in current levels that the subjects received. Analysis of the cranial bone showed that the gender difference and the frontal parietal differences are due to differences in cranial bone. Males have more cancelous parietal bone and females more dense parietal bone (P < 0.01). These differences should be considered when planning tCS studies and call into question earlier reports of gender differences due to hormonal influences.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Megavoltage radiotherapy to irregular superficial targets is challenging due to the skin sparing effect. We developed a three-dimensional bolus (3DB) program to assess the clinical impact on dosimetric and patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Planar commercial bolus (PCB) and 3DB density, clarity, and net bolus effect were rigorously evaluated prior to clinical implementation. After IRB approval, patients with cutaneous or locally advanced malignancies deemed to require bolus for radiotherapy treatment were treated with custom 3DB. RESULTS: The mean density of 3DB and PCB was of 1.07 g/cm 3 and 1.12 g/cm3, respectively. 3DB optic clarity was superior versus PCB at any material thickness. Phantom measurements of superficial dose with 3DB and PCB showed excellent bolus effect for both materials. 3DB reduced air gaps compared with PCB - particularly in irregular areas such as the ear, nose, and orbit. A dosimetric comparison of 3DB and PCB plans showed equivalent superficial homogeneity for 3DB and PCB (3DB median HI 1.249, range 1.111-1.300 and PCB median HI 1.165, range 1.094-1.279), but better conformity with 3DB (3DB median CI 0.993, range 0.962-0.993) versus PCB (PCB median CI 0.977, range 0.601-0.991). Patient dose measurements using 3DB confirm the delivered superficial dose was within 1% of the intended prescription (95% CI 97-102%; P = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: 3DB improves radiotherapy plan conformity, reduces air gap volume in irregular superficial areas which could affect superficial dose delivery, and provides excellent dose coverage to irregular superficial targets.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Palliation of advanced disease using radiotherapy can create difficult clinical situations where standard computed tomography simulation and immobilization techniques are not feasible. We developed a linear accelerator-based radiotherapy simulation technique using nonstandard patient positioning for head and neck palliation using on-board kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography for 3-D volumetric planning and rapid treatment. Material and Methods: We proved cone-beam computed tomography simulation feasibility for semi-upright patient positioning using an anthropomorphic phantom on a clinical Elekta-Synergy linear accelerator. Cone-beam computed tomography imaging parameters were optimized for high-resolution image reconstruction and to ensure mechanical clearance. The patient was simulated using a cone-beam computed tomography-based approach and the cone-beam computed tomography digital imaging and communications in medicine file was imported to the treatment planning software to generate radiotherapy target volumes. Rapid planning was achieved by using a 3-level bulk density correction for air, soft tissue, and bone set at 0, 1.0, and 1.4 g/cm3, respectively. RESULTS: Patient volumetric imaging was obtained through cone-beam computed tomography simulation and treatment was delivered as planned without incident. Bulk density corrections were verified against conventionally simulated patients where differences were less than 1%. Conclusion: We successfully developed and employed a semi-upright kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography-based head and neck simulation and treatment planning method for 3-D conformal radiotherapy delivery. This approach provides 3-D documentation of the radiotherapy plan and allows tabulation of quantitative spatial dose information which is valuable if additional palliative treatments are needed in the future. This is a potentially valuable technique that has broad clinical applicability for benign and palliative treatments across multiple disease sites-particularly where standard supine simulation and immobilization techniques are not possible.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To provide a comprehensive understanding of how the selection of radiation dose affects the temporal and spatial progression of radiation-induced necrosis in the rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Necrosis was induced with a single fraction of radiation exposure, at doses ranging between 20 and 60 Gy, to the right hemisphere of 8-week-old Fischer rats from a linear accelerator. The development and progression of necrosis in the rats was monitored and quantified every other week with T1- and T2-weighted gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI studies. RESULTS: The time to onset of necrosis was found to be dose-dependent, but after the initial onset, the necrosis progression rate and total volume generated was constant across different doses ranging between 30 and 60 Gy. Radiation doses less than 30 Gy did not develop necrosis within 33 weeks after treatment, indicating a dose threshold existing between 20 and 30 Gy. CONCLUSION: The highest dose used in this study led to the shortest time to onset of radiation-induced necrosis, while producing comparable disease progression dynamics after the onset. Therefore, for the radiation-induced necrosis rat model using a linear accelerator, the most optimum results were generated from a dose of 60 Gy.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Previous studies demonstrate that intratumoral CpG immunotherapy in combination with radiotherapy acts as an in-situ vaccine inducing antitumor immune responses capable of eradicating systemic disease. Unfortunately, most patients fail to respond. We hypothesized that immunotherapy can paradoxically upregulate immunosuppressive pathways, a phenomenon we term \"rebound immune suppression,\" limiting clinical responses. We further hypothesized that the immunosuppressive enzyme indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a mechanism of rebound immune suppression and that IDO blockade would improve immunotherapy efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the efficacy and immunologic effects of a novel triple therapy consisting of local radiotherapy, intratumoral CpG, and systemic IDO blockade in murine models and a pilot canine clinical trial. RESULTS: In murine models, we observed marked increase in intratumoral IDO expression after treatment with radiotherapy, CpG, or other immunotherapies. The addition of IDO blockade to radiotherapy + CpG decreased IDO activity, reduced tumor growth, and reduced immunosuppressive factors, such as regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment. This triple combination induced systemic antitumor effects, decreasing metastases, and improving survival in a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent manner. We evaluated this novel triple therapy in a canine clinical trial, because spontaneous canine malignancies closely reflect human cancer. Mirroring our mouse studies, the therapy was well tolerated, reduced intratumoral immunosuppression, and induced robust systemic antitumor effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IDO maintains immune suppression in the tumor after therapy, and IDO blockade promotes a local antitumor immune response with systemic consequences. The efficacy and limited toxicity of this strategy are attractive for clinical translation. Clin Cancer Res; 22(17); 4328-40. ©2016 AACR.",

    "abstract": "NysL, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces noursei, catalyzes the C10 hydroxylation of 10-deoxynystain to nystatin A1, a clinically important antifungal. In this study, we present the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of NysL bound to nystatin A1. The structure of this complex provides key insights into the structural elements that dictate the regio- and stereo-selective oxidation of large 20-44-membered macrolide substrates. The closely related AmphL operates on a similar 38-member macrolide but oxidizes C8 rather than C10. This difference requires that the substrate for AmphL penetrate further into the active site relative to NysL. The depth of substrate penetration is controlled by interactions between an area of the substrate binding pocket deemed the \"back-wall\" and the hemiketal ring of the macrolide substrate.",

    "abstract": "Cysteine is one of the most functionally diverse of the proteinogenic amino acids, owing to its reactive thiol side chain that can undergo deprotonation to form a strongly nucleophilic thiolate. However, few techniques can directly interrogate sulfur charge and covalency in cysteine, particularly in proteins. X-ray spectroscopies provide an element specific probe of sulfur. We demonstrate the sensitivity of S Kβ and Kα X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to cysteine ionization and compare it to S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in the physiologically relevant biomolecules l-cysteine and N-acetyl-l-cysteine at room temperature in solution phase. Kβ XES and K-edge XAS are most sensitive to chemical changes at the cysteine thiol and can be used to evaluate the composition of thiol/thiolate mixtures. These results provide a foundation for assessing the pKa of functionally significant cysteine residues in proteins and open the door to time-resolved studies of cysteine-dependent enzymes.",

    "abstract": "NiII 2,2'-bipyridine complexes are commonly invoked intermediates in metallaphotoredox cross-coupling reactions. Despite their ubiquity, design principles targeting improved catalytic performance remain underdetermined. A series of Ni(Rbpy)(R'Ar)Cl (R = MeOOC, t-Bu, R' = CH3, CF3) complexes were proposed to have multiconfigurational electronic structures on the basis of multiconfigurational/multireference calculations, with significant mixing of Ni → bpy metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) configurations into the ground-state wave function. Here, Ni K-edge and L2,3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopies provide experimental support for the highly covalent and multiconfigurational electronic structures of these complexes. The pre-edge intensity in the K-edge spectrum reflects highly covalent Ni-aryl bonding. The L3-edge spectral shape is dependent on ligand functionalization, and a feature reflecting the MLCT character is assigned using prior ab initio and new semiempirical calculations. The results suggest the push/pull effects of the aryl/bpy ligands moderate the changes in electron density on Ni during the multiredox cross-coupling reaction cycle.",

    "abstract": "The overproduction of nitric oxide by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is associated with several neuropathological conditions. As a result, inhibition of nNOS is a desirable therapeutic goal while avoiding the inhibition of endothelial NOS (eNOS) given its essential role in maintaining cardiovascular tone. Designing inhibitors with high specificity for nNOS over eNOS is challenging given the close similarity in the active site structure of all mammalian NOS isoforms. Computational methods like free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI) offer attractive avenues for rational drug design, but application of these methods to NOS is hindered by several challenges, including proper handling of highly charged inhibitors with diverse structures as well as computational expense. To address these issues, we present a simplified approach combining continuum dielectric generalized born (GB) solvent models with linear interaction energy (LIE) calculations. Our method demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data for charged inhibitors targeting mammalian NOS isoforms (mNOS). Our results highlight the utility of the GB-LIE method as a promising tool for screening NOS inhibitors and potentially other protein targets with charged active sites and diverse inhibitor structures.",

    "abstract": "Heme peroxidases represent an important category of heme-containing metalloenzymes that harness peroxide to oxidize a diverse array of substrates. Capitalizing on a well-established catalytic mechanism, diverse peroxidase mimics have been widely investigated and optimized. Herein, we report on the design, assembly, characterization, and genetic engineering of an artificial heme-based peroxidase relying on the biotin-streptavidin technology. The crystal structures of the wild-type and the best-performing double mutant of artificial peroxidases provide valuable insight regarding the nearby residues strategically mutated to optimize the peroxidase activity (i.e., Sav S112E K121H). We hypothesize that these two residues mimic the polar residues in the second coordination sphere, involved in activating the bound peroxide in two very widely studied peroxidases: chloroperoxidase (CPO) (i.e., Glu 183 and His 105) and horseradish peroxidase (i.e., Arg 38 and His 42). Despite the absence of a tightly bound axial ligand, which can exert a “push effect”, the evolved artificial peroxidase exhibits best-in-class activity for oxidizing two standard substrates (TMB and ABTS) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.",

It occurs as an understory vine in riparian and chaparral areas and in forest edges and windrows. The geographic range of this plant species almost entirely overlaps with that of its major specialized herbivore, the California Pipevine Swallowtail Butterfly Battus philenor hirsuta. While this species pair is a useful, ecologically well-understood system to study co-evolution, until recently, genomic resources for both have been lacking. Here, we report a new, chromosome-level assembly of A. californica as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Following the sequencing and assembly strategy of the CCGP, we used Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Hi-C chromatin proximity sequencing technology to produce a de novo assembled genome. Our genome assembly, the first for any species in the genus, contains 531 scaffolds spanning 661 megabase (Mb) pairs, with a contig N50 of 6.53 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 42.2 Mb, and BUSCO complete score of 98%.

In this paper, we report the assembly of the nuclear genome of Calasterella californica. As part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP), we used Pacific Biosciences HiFi long-read sequencing data to produce a de novo assembly that consists of 772 contigs, with a total length of 517 Mbp and a BUSCO complete score of 95%. C. californica is only the sixth species of liverworts - a group with more than 7200 described species - to have a nuclear reference genome. The availability of this reference genome will facilitate the study of the unique features of C. californica and other liverworts, pave the road towards a comparative understanding of liverwort genomes, and add an important starting point for studies of the geographic variation of this species within the CCGP project.",

    "abstract": "We describe a highly contiguous and complete diploid genome assembly for the Chryxus Arctic, Oeneis chryxus (E. Doubleday, [1849]), a butterfly species complex spanning much of northern and western North America. One subspecies, the Ivallda Arctic (O. c. ivallda), is endemic to California's Sierra Nevada and of particular biogeographic interest and conservation concern. Extreme alpine habitats occupied by this subspecies include the summit of Mt. Whitney, California, representing the highest elevation butterfly population in North America. The assembly presented here consists of two haplotypes, 738.92 and 770.85 Mb in length, with contig N50 values of 10.49 and 10.13 Mb, scaffold N50 values of 25.35 and 25.69 Mb, scaffold L50 values of 13 and 14, and BUSCO completeness scores of 96.5 and 98.3%, respectively. More than 97% of the assembly is organized into 29 scaffolds, which likely represent whole chromosomes. This assembly is the first major genomic resource for Oeneis, providing a foundational reference for future genomic studies on the taxonomy, evolutionary history, and conservation of the genus. As part of the California Conservation Genomics Project, we will use this assembly in conjunction with short-read resequencing to resolve patterns of evolutionary differentiation, adaptive genomic variation, and gene flow among remaining O. c. ivallda populations. These data can and will be used to inform the subspecies' conservation as warming climatic conditions continue to lead to the loss and fragmentation of alpine habitats. We also provide genome assemblies for the O. chryxus mitochondrion and a Wolbachia endosymbiont.",

This analysis takes place in relation to the central concept underlying the pil-grimage, that of pampachay, which literally means “flattening the ground.” While the whole pilgrimage is a way to maintain a reciprocal relationship with the Taytacha Qoyllur Rit’i (an image of Christ crucified on a rock at the bottom of a glacier), the traditional on-foot travel has specific key rituals that must take place along the way to reestablish this reciprocity. Pilgrims need to carry stones uphill and put them in designated places where they will leave them for good. By doing so pilgrims leave behind the part of themselves that might have disturbed the reciprocal relationship with the Taytacha.",

Three pathogens are prevalent in farmed Atlantic salmon in BC, spill over to wild Pacific salmon, and are linked to negative impacts on wild salmon: Piscine orthoreovirus, Tenacibaculum spp., and sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). Molecular screening of infectious agents in farmed and wild salmon and environmental DNA highlights a further 4 agents that are likely elevated near salmon farms and 37 that co-occur in wild and farmed salmon. Pathogens likely affect wild salmon indirectly by mediating migration, competition, and predation. Current net-pen aquaculture practices pose these risks to numerous populations of all species of wild salmon in BC, most of which are not covered in Government of Canada science and advisory reports. Climate change, pathogen evolution, and changes to disease management and aquaculture regulations will influence future risks.",

We use the example of salmon aquaculture in British Columbia, Canada, to demonstrate how science advice from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) can fail to be impartial, evidence-based, transparent, and independently reviewed—four widely implemented standards of robust science advice. Consequently, DFO's policies are not always supported by the best available science. These observations are particularly important in the context of DFO having struggled to sustainably manage Canada's marine resources, creating socio-economic uncertainty and putting the country's international reputation at risk as it lags behind its peers. We conclude by reiterating Hutchings et al.’s unheeded recommendation for a truly independent fisheries-science advisory body in Canada to be enshrined in the decision-making process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Molecular and genetic techniques now allow selective tagging and manipulation of the population of neurons, often referred to as \"engram cells,\" that were active during a specific experience. One common approach to labeling these cells is to use the fos-tTA transgenic mouse (TetTag). In addition to tagging cells active during learning, it is common to examine the reactivation of these cells using immediate early gene (IEG) expression as an index of neural activity. There are currently multiple TetTag lines available. The original line, cryopreserved at MMRRC, contains only the fos-tTA transgene, while Jackson Labs provides a version of the mouse that expresses both the fos-tTA and fos-shEGFP genes. In the current experiments, we examined IEG expression in these two mouse lines. Unexpectedly, we found that Jackson fos-tTA/fos-shEGFP mice express increased levels of c-Fos in the hippocampus compared to wild type animals when examined with immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of other IEGs, such as Arc and Egr-1, was not elevated in these mice, suggesting that the overexpression of c-Fos is not the result of increased excitability or broad changes in gene expression. qPCR revealed that Jackson fos-tTA/fos-shEGFP mice express mRNA corresponding to a c-Fos-Exon1-GFP fusion molecule, which may bind to C-Fos antibodies during IHC and inflate apparent c-Fos expression. Jackson fos-tTA/fos-shEGFP mice did not differ from their wild-type counterparts in fear expression or memory, indicating no behavioral effect of the presence of a c-Fos-GFP fusion protein. These results identify a major limitation inherent in the use of Jackson fos-tTA/fos-shEGFP mice.",

    "abstract": "Locus coeruleus (LC) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not.",

    "abstract": "Binding events that occur at different times are essential for memory formation. In trace fear conditioning, animals associate a tone and footshock despite no temporal overlap. The hippocampus is thought to mediate this learning by maintaining a memory of the tone until shock occurrence, however, evidence for sustained hippocampal tone representations is lacking. Here, we demonstrate a retrospective role for the hippocampus in trace fear conditioning. Bulk calcium imaging revealed sustained increases in CA1 activity after footshock that were not observed after tone termination. Optogenetic silencing of CA1 immediately after footshock impaired subsequent memory. Additionally, footshock increased the number of sharp-wave ripples compared to baseline during conditioning. Therefore, post-shock hippocampal activity likely supports learning by reactivating and linking latent tone and shock representations. These findings highlight an underappreciated function of post-trial hippocampal activity in enabling retroactive temporal associations during new learning, as opposed to persistent maintenance of stimulus representations.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus can be divided into distinct segments that make unique contributions to learning and memory. The dorsal segment supports cognitive processes like spatial learning and navigation while the ventral hippocampus regulates emotional behaviors related to fear, anxiety and reward. In the current study, we determined how pyramidal cells in ventral CA1 respond to spatial cues and aversive stimulation during a context fear conditioning task. We also examined the effects of high and low frequency stimulation of these neurons on defensive behavior. Similar to previous work in the dorsal hippocampus, we found that cells in ventral CA1 expressed high-levels of c-Fos in response to a novel spatial environment. Surprisingly, however, the number of activated neurons did not increase when the environment was paired with footshock. This was true even in the subpopulation of ventral CA1 pyramidal cells that send direct projections to the amygdala. When these cells were stimulated at high-frequencies (20 Hz) we observed feedforward inhibition of basal amygdala neurons and impaired expression of context fear. In contrast, low-frequency stimulation (4 Hz) did not inhibit principal cells in the basal amygdala and produced an increase in fear generalization. Similar results have been reported in dorsal CA1. Therefore, despite clear differences between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, CA1 neurons in each segment appear to make similar contributions to context fear conditioning.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus plays an essential role in the formation and retrieval of episodic memories in humans and contextual memories in animals. However, amnesia is not always observed when this structure is compromised. To determine why this is the case, we compared the effects of several different circuit manipulations on memory retrieval and hippocampal activity. Mice were first trained on context fear conditioning and then optogenetic and chemogenetic tools were used to alter activity during memory retrieval. We found that retrieval was only impaired when manipulations caused widespread changes (increases or decreases) in hippocampal activity. Widespread increases occurred when pyramidal cells were excited and widespread decreases were found when GABAergic neurons were stimulated. Direct hyperpolarization of excitatory neurons only moderately reduced activity and did not produce amnesia. Surprisingly, widespread decreases in hippocampal activity did not prevent retrieval if they occurred gradually prior to testing. This suggests that intact brain regions can express contextual memories if they are given adequate time to compensate for the loss of the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "The Wasserstein distance has become increasingly important in machine learning and deep learning. Despite its popularity, the Wasserstein distance is hard to approximate because of the curse of dimensionality. A recently proposed approach to alleviate the curse of dimensionality is to project the sampled data from the high dimensional probability distribution onto a lower-dimensional subspace, and then compute the Wasserstein distance between the projected data. However, this approach requires to solve a max-min problem over the Stiefel manifold, which is very challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian block coordinate descent (RBCD) method to solve this problem, which is based on a novel reformulation of the regularized max-min problem over the Stiefel manifold. We show that the complexity of arithmetic operations for RBCD to obtain an ε-stationary point is O(ε-3), which is significantly better than the complexity of existing methods. Numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method is more efficient than existing methods, especially when the number of sampled data is very large.",

Thus, performing large-scale machine learning operations with the distributed datasets through communication networks is often required. In this paper, we study the convergence rate of the distributed dual coordinate ascent for distributed machine learning problems in a general tree-structured network. Since a tree network model can be understood as the generalization of a star network, our algorithm can be thought of as the generalization of the distributed dual coordinate ascent in a star network. We provide the convergence rate of the distributed dual coordinate ascent over a general tree network in a recursive manner and analyze the network effect on the convergence rate. Secondly, by considering network communication delays, we optimize the distributed dual coordinate ascent algorithm to maximize its convergence speed. From our analytical result, we can choose the optimal number of local iterations depending on the communication delay severity to achieve the fastest convergence speed. In numerical experiments, we consider machine learning scenarios over communication networks, where local workers cannot directly reach to a central node due to constraints in communication, and demonstrate that the usability of our distributed dual coordinate ascent algorithm in tree networks.",

    "abstract": "$k$ Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method is a simple and popular statistical method for classification and regression. For both classification and regression problems, existing works have shown that, if the distribution of the feature vector has bounded support and the probability density function is bounded away from zero in its support, the convergence rate of the standard kNN method, in which $k$ is the same for all test samples, is minimax optimal. On the contrary, if the distribution has unbounded support, we show that there is a gap between the convergence rate achieved by the standard kNN method and the minimax bound. To close this gap, we propose an adaptive kNN method, in which different $k$ is selected for different samples. Our selection rule does not require precise knowledge of the underlying distribution of features. The proposed adaptive method significantly outperforms the standard one. We characterize the convergence rate of the proposed adaptive method, and show that it matches the minimax lower bound.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of hypothesis testing rules. In the considered model, after a sample is generated, it will be modified by an adversary before being observed by the decision maker. The decision maker needs to decide the underlying hypothesis that generates the sample from the adversarially-modified data. We formulate this problem as a minimax hypothesis testing problem, in which the goal of the adversary is to design attack strategy to maximize the error probability while the decision maker aims to design decision rules so as to minimize the error probability. We consider both hypothesis-Aware case, in which the attacker knows the true underlying hypothesis, and hypothesis-unaware case, in which the attacker does not know the true underlying hypothesis. We solve this minimax problem and characterize the corresponding optimal strategies for both cases.",

In the considered model, there is a malicious adversary who can observe the whole dataset, and then will carefully modify the response values or the feature matrix in order to manipulate the selected features. We formulate the modification strategy of the adversary as a bi-level optimization problem. Due to the difficulty of the non-differentiability of the \\ell _1 norm at the zero point, we reformulate the \\ell _1 norm regularizer as linear inequality constraints. We employ the interior-point method to solve this reformulated LASSO problem and obtain the gradient information. Then we use the projected gradient descent method to design the modification strategy. In addition, we demonstrate that this method can be extended to other \\ell _1 based feature selection methods, such as group LASSO and sparse group LASSO. Numerical examples with synthetic and real data illustrate that our method is efficient and effective.",

    "abstract": "Wheat gliadins and glutenins confer valuable end-use characteristics but include amino acid sequences (epitopes) that can elicit celiac disease (CeD) in genetically predisposed individuals. The onset of CeD in these individuals is affected by the amount and duration of the exposure to immunogenic epitopes. Therefore, a reduction of epitopes that result in high immune responses in the majority of CeD patients (immunodominant epitopes) may reduce the incidence of CeD at a population level. We generated gamma radiation-induced deletions encompassing the α-gliadins in each of the three wheat genomes and characterized them using exome capture. These deletions, designated as Δgli-A2, Δgli-B2, and Δgli-D2, were deposited in GRIN-Global. The Δgli-A2 and Δgli-B2 deletions showed limited effects on breadmaking quality, but the Δgli-D2 deletion significantly increased gluten strength and improved breadmaking quality without compromising dough elasticity, protein content, or grain yield. The stronger effect of Δgli-D2 on gluten strength was associated with an increased proportion of glutenins and the deletion of α-gliadins with seven cysteines, which are absent in the GLI-A2 and GLI-B2 loci. We show that α-gliadins with seven cysteines are incorporated into the gluten polymer, where they likely function as chain terminators limiting the expansion of the gluten polymer and reducing its strength. In addition to its beneficial effects on breadmaking quality, the Δgli-D2 deletion eliminates major wheat immunodominant CeD epitopes. The deployment of this publicly available Δgli-D2 deletion can simultaneously improve wheat gluten strength and reduce the population-wide burden of CeD.",

    "abstract": "While numerous wheat phenology prediction models are available, most of them are constrained to using variety-dependent coefficients. The overarching objective of this study was to calibrate a gene-based model to predict wheat heading date that allows breeders to select specific gene combinations that would head within the optimal window for a given environment independently of varietal genetic background. A dataset with a total of 49 Argentine wheat cultivars and two recombinant inbred lines was chosen to cover a wide range of allelic combinations for major vernalization, photoperiod, and earliness per-se genes. The model was validated using independent data from an Argentine wheat trial network that includes sites from a wide latitudinal range. Ultimately, using this gene-based model, simulations were made to identify optimal gene combinations (ideotypes) × site combinations in contrasting locations. The selected model accurately predicted heading date with an overall median error of 4.6 days. This gene-based crop model for wheat phenology allowed the identification of groups of gene combinations predicted to head within a low-risk window and can be adapted to predict other phenological stages based on accessible climatic information and publicly available molecular markers, facilitating its adoption in wheat-growing regions worldwide.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported a structural rearrangement between wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale) chromosomes 1BS/1RS that increased the dosage of 12-OXOPHYTODIENOATE REDUCTASE III (OPRIII) genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis (henceforth, 1RW line), and that drastically reduced primary root growth relative to a control line with the intact 1RS chromosome (henceforth, 1RS). In this study, we show that the increased gene-dosage of this region is associated with increases in the shoot-root partitioning of magnesium (Mg). Moreover, both a CRISPR-edited 1RW line with reduced OPRIII dosage and the 1RW line treated with the jasmonate biosynthesis inhibitor ibuprofen showed reduced differences in shoot-root Mg partitioning than 1RW. The observed differences in Mg partitioning between 1RS and 1RW plants occur over a wide range of external Mg supplies and imply opposite trends of Mg accumulation in roots and shoots. Furthermore, we show an association between the increase of shoot-root Mg partitioning and increased tolerance of the 1RW line to low levels of Mg supply. In summary, our results provide evidence of the role of the jasmonate pathway on the dynamics of Mg accumulation in roots and shoots, which correlates with the performance of wheat plants under conditions of Mg scarcity.",

    "issued": "2024-04",
    "abstract": "Precise regulation of flowering time is critical for cereal crops to synchronize reproductive development with optimum environmental conditions, thereby maximizing grain yield. The plant-specific gene GIGANTEA (GI) plays an important role in the control of flowering time, with additional functions on the circadian clock and plant stress responses. In this study, we show that GI loss-of-function mutants in a photoperiod-sensitive tetraploid wheat background exhibit significant delays in heading time under both long-day (LD) and short-day photoperiods, with stronger effects under LD. However, this interaction between GI and photoperiod is no longer observed in isogenic lines carrying either a photoperiod-insensitive allele in the PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) gene or a loss-of-function allele in EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), a known repressor of PPD1. These results suggest that the normal circadian regulation of PPD1 is required for the differential effect of GI on heading time in different photoperiods. Using crosses between mutant or transgenic plants of GI and those of critical genes in the flowering regulation pathway, we show that GI accelerates wheat heading time by promoting FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1) expression via interactions with ELF3, VERNALIZATION 2 (VRN2), CONSTANS (CO), and the age-dependent microRNA172-APETALA2 (AP2) pathway, at both transcriptional and protein levels. Our study reveals conserved GI mechanisms between wheat and Arabidopsis but also identifies specific interactions of GI with the distinctive photoperiod and vernalization pathways of the temperate grasses. These results provide valuable knowledge for modulating wheat heading time and engineering new varieties better adapted to a changing environment.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tapering of chronic opioids has increased, with subsequent reports of exacerbated pain among patients who tapered. We aimed to evaluate the association between opioid dose tapering and subsequent pain-related healthcare utilization (emergency department [ED] visits, hospitalizations and primary care visits). DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from years 2015-2019 using data from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse that contains de-identified retrospective administrative claims data for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees in the United States. Adults aged ≥18 years who were prescribed stable doses of opioids, ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, during a 12-month baseline period. METHODS: Tapering was defined as ≥15% relative reduction in mean daily opioid dose during one of 6 overlapping 60-day periods. Tapered patient-periods were subclassified as tapered-and-continued (MME > 0) vs tapered-and-discontinued (MME = 0). We modeled monthly counts of visits for pain diagnoses up to 12 months after cohort entry using negative binomial regression as a function of tapering, baseline utilization, and patient level-covariates. RESULTS: Among 47 033 patients, 13 793 patients tapered. Compared to no taper, any taper was associated with more ED visits for pain (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.30), tapered then continued status was associated with more ED visits (aIRR 1.23, CI: 1.14-1.32) and hospitalizations (aIRR 1.14, CI: 1.03-1.27) f-or pain, and tapered-and-discontinued was associated with fewer primary care visits for pain (aIRR 0.68, CI: 0.61-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: These associations suggest that opioid tapering may lead to increased emergency and hospital utilization for acute pain and possibly a decreased perceived need for primary care for those whose opioids were discontinued.",

During a mean follow-up of 9.1 months, unadjusted disenrollment rates among primary commercial beneficiaries and Medicare Advantage enrollees were 37.2 and 13.9 per 100 person-years, respectively. Incident overdoses were associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment with a statistically significantly stronger association among primary commercial insurance beneficiaries [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1.48 (95% CI: 1.33-1.64)] as compared to Medicare Advantage enrollees [aIRR 1.15 (95% CI: 1.07-1.23)]. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients prescribed long-term opioids, overdose events were strongly associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment, especially among primary commercial insurance beneficiaries. These findings raise concerns about the social consequences of overdose, including potential health insurance loss, which may limit patient access to care at a time of heightened vulnerability.",

    "issued": "2024-02",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: In this systematic review, the authors examine the prevalence and extent of stigmatizing attitudes among health care professionals (HCPs) and trainees against patients with substance use disorders (SUDs), including research on interventions to reduce stigma. METHOD: The authors searched 7 databases for articles published from January 1, 2011, through February 15, 2023, that quantified SUD stigma among HCPs or trainees. Inclusion criteria allowed both observational and intervention studies from the United States or Canada to be included in this review. Quality assessment was applied to all included studies; studies were not excluded based on quality. RESULTS: A total of 1,992 unique articles were identified of which 32 articles (17 observational studies and 15 intervention studies), all conducted in the United States, met the inclusion criteria. Half of the included studies (16 of 32) were published in 2020 or later. Most of the intervention studies (13 of 15) used a single-group pre-post design; interventions involved didactics and/or interactions with persons with SUDs. The 32 included studies used a total of 19 different measures of stigma. All 17 observational studies showed some degree of HCP or trainee stigma against patients with SUDs. Most intervention studies (12 of 15) found small but statistically significant reductions in stigma after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: SUD stigma exists among HCPs and trainees. Some interventions to reduce this stigma had positive impacts, but future studies with larger, diverse participants and comparison groups are needed. Heterogeneity among studies and stigma measures limits the ability to interpret results across studies. Future rigorous research is needed to determine validated, consensus measures of SUD stigma among HCPs and trainees, identify stigma scores that are associated with clinical outcomes, and develop effective antistigma interventions for HCPs and trainees.",

    "abstract": "Context: Health plan disenrollment has been associated with higher mortality in patients with opioid use disorder. Insurance loss and health plan disenrollment might be downstream social consequences of opioid misuse and overdose that may heighten patient mortality risks during a period of heightened need for professional assistance. Objective: To test hypotheses that: 1) overdose events in patients prescribed long-term opioids are associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment; and 2) buprenorphine initiation after overdose would attenuate this association. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Dataset: Data from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse which includes de-identified medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment records for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees. The database contains longitudinal health information on patients, representing a mixture of ages, ethnicities, and geographical regions across the United States. Population studied: Adults (aged ≥18 years) prescribed stable, opioid therapy for a 6-month baseline period (≥90% of days covered, <10% monthly fluctuation from 6-month average, average daily dose ≥10 morphine milligram equivalents). Outcome Measures: Health plan disenrollment during up to one year of follow-up. Negative binomial regression estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios of disenrollment by incident overdose and buprenorphine initiation after overdose. Results: We identified 556,676 patients who were followed up after 1,119,100 stable periods of opioid therapy. During follow-up, 17.5% of person-periods ended in health plan disenrollment. Overdose events during follow-up were associated with health plan disenrollment with a dose-response relationship [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) for 1 overdose event = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24-1.35); aIRR for ≥2 overdose events = 1.51 (1.43-1.59)]. Among patients with overdose events, subsequent buprenorphine initiation was associated with substantially reduced risk of health plan disenrollment [aIRR 0.36 (0.17-0.74)]. Conclusions: Overdose events in patients prescribed long-term opioids may portend other social consequences, such as health insurance loss, which may exacerbate patient risk at a time of heightened need and vulnerability. Buprenorphine may mitigate the risk of health plan disenrollment in opioid-prescribed patients who overdose.",

    "issued": "2022-01",
    "abstract": "Clinical trials worldwide were disrupted when the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020. Most intervention trials moved to some form of remote implementation due to restrictions on in-person research activities. Although the proportion of remote trials is growing, they remain the vast minority of studies in part due to few successful examples. Our team transitioned Goals for Reaching Optimal Wellness (GROWell), an NIH-funded (R01NR017659) randomized control trial (RCT; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04449432) originally designed as a hybrid intervention, into a fully remote clinical trial. GROWell is a digital dietary intervention for people who enter pregnancy with overweight or obesity. Primary outcomes include gestational weight gain and six-month postpartum weight retention. Strategies that we have tested, refined, and deployed include: (a) use of a HIPAA-compliant, web-based participant recruitment and engagement platform; (b) use of a HIPAA-compliant digital health platform to disseminate GROWell and conduct study visits (c) interconnectivity of these two platforms for seamless recruitment, consent, enrollment, intervention delivery, follow-up, and study team blinding; (d) detailed SMS messages to address initial challenges with protocol adherence; (e) email notifications alerting the study team about missed participant surveys so they can follow-up; (f) remuneration using email gift cards with recipient choice of vendor; and (g) geotargeting social media campaigns to improve participation of Black Indigenous and People of Color Communities. These strategies have resulted in screen failure rates improving by 7%, study task adherence improving by an average of 20-30% across study visits, and study completion rates of 82%. Researchers may consider some or all of these approaches in future remote mHealth trials.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the in-hospital postcardiac arrest (PCA) care and short- and long-term functional outcomes of dogs and cats surviving to hospital discharge after naturally occurring cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and CPR. DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective observational study. SETTING: Three veterinary teaching hospitals. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs (n = 25) and cats (n = 15). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Medical records of animals that underwent CPR and survived to discharge were retrospectively reviewed, and information was recorded regarding CPR event, PCA hospitalization, and short- and long-term outcomes. Ninety-two percent of CPA events occurred in hospital and were witnessed, and 8% occurred out of hospital. Eighty-five percent of events occurred during general anesthesia or sedation. CPR efforts ranged from <1 to 18 min, and animals remained hospitalized between 0.5 and 15.5 days after return of spontaneous circulation. Seventy-three percent of animals required supplemental oxygen, 13% required mechanical ventilation, and 20% required vasopressor, positive inotropic, or glucocorticoid therapy. Hyperosmolar therapies were administered to 38% of animals, anticonvulsants were given to 18%, and 8% of animals developed new-onset PCA seizures. The median (range) modified Glasgow Coma Scale score before CPA was 18 (11-18), 12 h PCA was 16 (6-18), and 72 h PCA was 17.5 (14-18). Median survival time was 455 days (range: 11-2650 days). Twenty-five percent of owners perceived a persistent disability in their pets, from behavioral changes to required nutritional and recumbent care. Nonetheless, all owners reported their pet's PCA quality of life to be good. CONCLUSIONS: Good short- and long-term functional outcomes post-CPA can be achieved in dogs and cats. Functional survival remains possible in some cases of out-of-hospital CPA and after prolonged CPR, suggesting a benefit of high-quality CPR in all scenarios. Patient stabilization and neurological improvement may take 48-72 h, and early discouraging findings should not prevent continuation of PCA care.",

    "abstract": "\"Neurophobia\" is a phenomenon in human medical education where students develop negative attitudes towards neurology, impeding student learning and future clinical practice. While suspected to exist in veterinary medical education, it remains unstudied. The main objectives of this study were to examine North American veterinary student attitudes towards neurology and neurology education and explore elements that might contribute to neurophobia. Additional objectives were to evaluate veterinary educators' perceptions of student neurophobia and to develop and validate a scoring tool (VetNeuroQ) to quantify veterinary neurophobia. Veterinary students and faculty at North American veterinary schools were surveyed. A scoring tool was developed from a subset of questions and validated using confirmatory factor analysis. Six hundred six anonymous responses were collected from students at all stages of veterinary education. Neurology training was reported as insufficient by 35.9% and most respondents perceived neurology to not be easy to learn. Neuroanatomy/physiology and neurolocalization were considered difficult concepts. Students rated low confidence in neurology (vs. other topics), and low interest in the Neurology/Neurosurgery specialty. 61.7% of educators reported neurophobia amongst their students. The proposed VetNeuroQ scale showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha >0.7) and validity (p < .05; CFI >0.9, RMSEA <0.08). VetNeuroQ scores were low but improved over the course of veterinary education. These findings demonstrate low self-efficacy, interest, and confidence, along with perceptions of difficulty, amongst veterinary students, consistent with neurophobia. Contributing elements are discussed. The VetNeuroQ scale allows quantification of veterinary student neurophobia and may be useful for screening students and assessing the impact of educational interventions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Horner syndrome often occurs with cervical myelopathies and might provide insight into the underlying disease and prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and imaging features of dogs with cervical myelopathy and concurrent Horner syndrome and to determine association of Horner syndrome with diseases or magnetic resonance images (MRI). ANIMALS: Ninety-three client-owned dogs with cervical myelopathy and concurrent Horner syndrome and 99 randomly selected client-owned dogs with cervical myelopathy without Horner syndrome (control cases). METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records were reviewed to identify Horner and control cases and clinical findings recorded. MRI were reviewed, and lesions characterized and recorded. Descriptive and comparative statistics were performed. RESULTS: Non-compressive disease occurred more frequently in the Horner group compared with controls (58%; 95% CI: 48-68 vs 9%; 95% CI: 5-16; P < .0001). The most common diseases were fibrocartilaginous embolism in the Horner group (44/93; 47%) and intervertebral disc extrusion (76/99; 77%) amongst controls. On MRI, parenchymal hyperintensity was seen more commonly in the Horner group (95%; 95% CI: 88-98) compared with controls (51%; 95% CI: 41-60; P < .0001). In the Horner group, dogs that did not survive to discharge (N = 13) had more extensive MRI lesions relative to the adjacent vertebral length (200%; IQR 110%-575%) compared with survivors (N = 80; 110%; IQR 40%-250%; P = .02). Lateralization of Horner signs and MRI changes matched in 54% of cases. The overall survival rate was high in both Horner (80/93; 86%) and control (95/99; 96%) groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Horner syndrome in cervical myelopathy is commonly associated with noncompressive intraparenchymal disease.",

    "abstract": "Language models for natural language processing have been grafted onto programming language modeling for advancing code intelligence. Although it can be represented in the text format, code is syntactically more rigorous, as it is designed to be properly compiled or interpreted to perform a set of behaviors given any inputs. In this case, existing works benefit from syntactic representations to learn from code less ambiguously in forms of abstract syntax tree, control-flow graph, etc. However, programs with the same purpose can be implemented in various ways showing different syntactic representations, while the ones with similar implementations can have distinct behaviors. Though trivially demonstrated during executions, such semantics about functionality are challenging to be learned directly from code, especially in an unsupervised manner. Hence, in this paper, we propose FuzzPretrain to explore the dynamic information of programs revealed by their test cases and embed it into the feature representations of code as complements. The test cases are obtained with the assistance of a customized fuzzer and are only required during pre-training. FuzzPretrain yielded more than 6%/19% mAP improvements on code search over its masked language modeling counterparts trained with only source code and source code coupled with abstract syntax trees (ASTs), respectively. Our experiments show the benefits of learning discriminative code representations from FuzzPretrain.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial prompts (or say, adversarial examples) generated using gradient-based methods exhibit outstanding performance in performing automatic jailbreak attacks against safety-aligned LLMs. Nevertheless, due to the discrete nature of texts, the input gradient of LLMs struggles to precisely reflect the magnitude of loss change that results from token replacements in the prompt, leading to limited attack success rates against safety-aligned LLMs, even in the white-box setting. In this paper, we explore a new perspective on this problem, suggesting that it can be alleviated by leveraging innovations inspired in transfer-based attacks that were originally proposed for attacking black-box image classification models. For the first time, we appropriate the ideologies of effective methods among these transfer-based attacks, i.e., Skip Gradient Method [53] and Intermediate Level Attack [18], into gradient-based adversarial prompt generation and achieve significant performance gains without introducing obvious computational cost. Meanwhile, by discussing mechanisms behind the gains, new insights are drawn, and proper combinations of these methods are also developed. Our empirical results show that 87% of the query-specific adversarial suffixes generated by the developed combination can induce Llama-2-7B-Chat to produce the output that exactly matches the target string on AdvBench. This match rate is 33% higher than that of a very strong baseline known as GCG, demonstrating advanced discrete optimization for adversarial prompt generation against LLMs. In addition, without introducing obvious cost, the combination achieves > 30% absolute increase in attack success rates compared with GCG when generating both query-specific (38% → 68%) and universal adversarial prompts (26.68% → 60.32%) for attacking the Llama-2-7B-Chat model on AdvBench.

    "abstract": "Intrusion detection is a long standing and crucial problem in security. A system capable of detecting intrusions automatically is on great demand in enterprise security solutions. Existing solutions rely heavily on hand-crafted rules designed by security operators, which suffer from high false negative rates and poor generalization ability to new, zero-day attacks at scale. AI and machine learning offer promising solutions to address the issues, by inspecting abnormal user behaviors intelligently and automatically from data. However, existing learning-based intrusion detection systems in the literature are mostly designed for small data, and they lack the ability to leverage the power of big data in cloud environments. In this paper, we target at this problem and introduce an intrusion detection system which incorporates large-scale pre-training, so as to train a large language model based on tens of millions of command lines for AI-based intrusion detection. Experiments performed on 30 million training samples and 10 million test samples verify the effectiveness of our solution.",

    "abstract": "Crafting high-quality fuzz drivers not only is time-consuming but also requires a deep understanding of the library. However, the state-of-the-art automatic fuzz driver generation techniques fall short of expectations. While fuzz drivers derived from consumer code can reach deep states, they have limited coverage. Conversely, interpretative fuzzing can explore most API calls but requires numerous attempts within a large search space. We propose PromptFuzz, a coverage-guided fuzzer for prompt fuzzing that iteratively generates fuzz drivers to explore undiscovered library code. To explore API usage in fuzz drivers during prompt fuzzing, we propose several key techniques: instructive program generation, erroneous program validation, coverage-guided prompt mutation, and constrained fuzzer scheduling. We implemented PromptFuzz and evaluated it on 14 real-world libraries. Compared with OSS-Fuzz and Hopper (the state-of-the-art fuzz driver generation tool), fuzz drivers generated by PromptFuzz achieved 1.61 and 1.63 times higher branch coverage than those by OSS-Fuzz and Hopper, respectively. Moreover, the fuzz drivers generated by PromptFuzz detected 33 genuine, new bugs out of a total of 49 crashes, out of which 30 bugs have been confirmed by their respective communities.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to human and animal health, and antimicrobial use selects for AMR. Appropriate selection of antimicrobial drugs is an important part of veterinary education, but many veterinary students report that they have knowledge gaps in this area. Students with greater self-efficacy, the belief that one can perform the individual steps that comprise a task, tend to expend more effort and motivation in learning new skills. Educational activities that improve self-efficacy can increase student motivation, but appropriate assessment tools tailored for specific educational domains are necessary to support these efforts. The purpose of this study was to validate an online survey instrument to measure veterinary student self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection. The secondary goal was to determine if clinical training increases veterinary students' self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection. A total of 380 students from seven veterinary colleges in the United States completed an online survey instrument that asked students to self-assess their abilities to perform 13 tasks associated with antimicrobial selection on a 10-point Likert-type scale. A principal components analysis identified three factors associated with self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection: (a) empirical selection and dosing of antimicrobials, (b) identification of trustworthy resources and resistance to pressure to prescribe, and (c) knowledge of when antimicrobials are needed. Self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection increases the most in the fourth year of veterinary training. However, exposure to at least one clinical rotation was not associated with higher self-efficacy for selection of antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is the most common cause of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in dogs. UTI recurrence comprises of persistent, unresolved E. coli infection or reinfection with a different strain of E. coli. Differentiating between these processes is clinically important but is often impossible with routine diagnostics. We tested the hypothesis that most recurrent canine E. coli bacteriuria is due to recurrence of the same E. coli strain involved in the initial infection. Molecular typing was performed on 98 urinary E. coli isolated from dogs with recurrent bacteriuria from five veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the United States. Of the 42 dogs in this study with multiple E. coli bacteriuria observations, a single strain of E. coli caused recurrent bacteriuria in 26 (62 %) dogs, in some cases on multiple occasions for prolonged periods of time (up to eight months). A single E. coli strain was detected during both subclinical bacteriuria and clinically-apparent UTI in three dogs. Isolates with the P-fimbrial adhesin genes papA and papC were associated with recurrence by the same strain of E. coli. Multiple isolations of a single strain of E. coli associated with recurrent bacteriuria suggests that E. coli may be maintained within the urinary tract of some dogs for prolonged periods of time. In some patients, the same strain can cause both clinical UTI and subclinical bacteriuria. This indicates that in dogs, the urinary bladder may serve as a subclinical, long-term reservoir of E. coli that may cause clinical UTI in the future.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Awareness of prescribing practices helps identify opportunities to improve antibiotic use (AU). OBJECTIVES: To estimate AU prevalence in dogs and cats in U.S. veterinary teaching hospitals (VTHs) and identify antibiotic drugs commonly prescribed, indications for use, and evidence of bacterial infection. ANIMALS: Medical record data were collected from dogs and cats examined at 14 VTHs. METHODS: Data were collected from VTH medical records of dogs and cats examined by primary care, urgent care, emergency and critical care, internal medicine, and surgery services on a single day during August 13-September 3, 2020. Data included signalment; clinical service; inpatient or outpatient status; clinical conditions; diagnostic tests; evidence of bacterial infection; intended reason for AU; name and route of antibiotics prescribed. RESULTS: Of 883 dogs and cats, 322 (36.5%) were prescribed at least 1 antibiotic. Among 285 antibiotics administered systemically intended for treatment of infection, 10.9% were prescribed without evidence of infection. The most common class of antibiotics presribed for systemic administration was potentiated penicillin for dogs (115/346, 33.3%) and cats (27/80, 33.8%). For dogs and cats, first-generation cephalosporins (93/346, 26.9% and 11/80, 13.8%, respectively) and fluoroquinolones (51/346, 14.7% and 19/80, 23.8%, respectively) was second or third most-prescribed. Common AU indications included skin, respiratory, and urinary conditions, and perioperative use. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Collaborative data collection provides a sustainable methodology to generate national AU prevalence estimates and bring attention to areas requiring additional research and detailed data collection. These efforts can also identify practice improvement opportunities in settings where future veterinarians are trained.",

It employs two original metrics to analyze 42 cases: The Data Question Typology, which allows for the organization of data questions into categories based on researcher objectives, and the Modified READ Scale for Data Questions (MRSD), which is used to record the magnitude of difficulty presented by each case. It finds that data questions differ significantly across academic fields and that successful research assistance often requires partnerships between subject specialists librarians and technological or computational experts. It concludes with a recommendation on how research libraries can facilitate a collaborative process and workflow for handling a diversity of data questions from across the university.",

Previous studies indicate that the number of Ch cells is decreased in autism, and that GABA receptors are decreased in the Ch cell synaptic target in the prefrontal cortex. To further identify Ch cell alterations, we examined whether the length of cartridges, and the number, density, and size of Ch cell synaptic boutons, differed in the prefrontal cortex of cases with autism versus control cases. We collected samples of postmortem human prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area (BA) 9, 46, and 47) from 20 cases with autism and 20 age- and sex-matched control cases. Ch cells were labeled using an antibody against parvalbumin, a marker that labeles soma, cartridges, and synaptic boutons. We found no significant difference in the average length of cartridges, or in the total number or density of boutons in control subjects vs. subjects with autism. However, we found a significant decrease in the size of Ch cell boutons in those with autism. The reduced size of Ch cell boutons may result in reduced inhibitory signal transmission and impact the balance of excitation to inhibition in the prefrontal cortex in autism.",

Astrocytes have many functions in the brain including a role in higher cognitive functions and in inflammatory brain processes. Therefore, an alteration in number, function, and/or activation state of astrocytes, could be present in ASD. We quantified astrocyte number in the gray and white matter of the prefrontal cortex-BA9, BA46, and BA47-in 15 ASD and 15 age- and sex-matched control cases. We labeled astrocytes with antibodies against the protein GFAP and S100β, markers of astrocytes. We found a significant decrease in the number of astrocytes in the gray and white matter of all prefrontal areas of interest with both markers. We also found an increased state of activation of GFAP+ astrocytes in all areas. A reduced number of astrocytes in the cerebral cortex in ASD could lead to impaired synaptic function and disrupted connectivity. An increased astrocyte activation may indicate a chronic mild inflammatory state of the cerebral cortex in ASD. Overall, we found that astrocytes are disrupted in ASD.",

The power of the immune system and our increasing understanding of the role it plays in acute and chronic illnesses are being leveraged to produce new treatments for a range of medical conditions. Given the importance of the human immune system in health and disease, detailed study of the immune system of nonhuman primates is essential to advance preclinical translational research. The need for nonhuman primates continues to remain a high priority, which has been acutely evident during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic. Nonhuman primates will continue to address key questions and provide predictive models to identify the safety and efficiency of new diagnostics and therapies for human use across the lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Varicose projection astrocytes (VP-As) are found in the cerebral cortex and have been described to be specific to humans and chimpanzees. To further examine the phylogenetic distribution of this cell type, we analyzed cortical tissue from several primates ranging from primitive primates to primates evolutionary closer to human such as apes. We specifically analyzed tissue from four strepsirrhine species, one tarsier, six species of platyrrhine monkeys, ten species of cercopithecoid monkeys, two hylobatid ape species, four to six cases each of chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan, and thirteen human. We found that VP-As were present only in human and other apes (hominoids) and were absent in all other species. We showed that VP-As are localized to layer VI and the superficial white matter of the cortex. The presence of VP-As co-occured with interlaminar astrocytes that also had varicosities in their processes. Due to their location, their long tangential processes, and their irregular presence within species, we propose that VP-As are astrocytes that develop varicosities under specific conditions and that are not a distinct astrocyte type.",

    "abstract": "Nonhuman primates are essential for the study of human disease and to explore the safety of new diagnostics and therapies proposed for human use. They share similar genetic, physiologic, immunologic, reproductive, and developmental features with humans and thus have proven crucial for the study of embryonic/fetal development, organ system ontogeny, and the role of the maternal-placental-fetal interface in health and disease. The fetus may be exposed to a variety of inflammatory stimuli including infectious microbes as well as maternal inflammation, which can result from infections, obesity, or environmental exposures. Growing evidence supports that inflammation is a mediator of fetal programming and that the maternal immune system is tightly integrated with fetal-placental immune responses that may set a postnatal path for future health or disease. This review addresses some of the unique features of the nonhuman primate model system, specifically the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), and importance of the species for studies focused on organ system ontogeny and the impact of viral teratogens in relation to development and congenital disorders.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors (CORD) were invited to contribute to the 2016 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME) Second Resident Duty Hours in the Learning and Working Environment Congress. We describe the joint process used by ACEP and CORD to capture the opinions of emergency medicine (EM) educators on the ACGME clinical and educational work hour standards, formulate recommendations, and inform subsequent congressional testimony. METHODS: In 2016 our joint working group of experts in EM medical education conducted a consensus-based, mixed-methods process using survey data from medical education stakeholders in EM and expert iterative discussions to create organizational position statements and recommendations for revisions of work hour standards. A 19-item survey was administered to a convenience sample of 199 EM residency training programs using a national EM educational listserv. RESULTS: A total of 157 educational leaders responded to the survey; 92 of 157 could be linked to specific programs, yielding a targeted response rate of 46.2% (92/199) of programs. Respondents commented on the impact of clinical and educational work-hour standards on patient safety, programmatic and personnel costs, resident caseload, and educational experience. Using survey results, comments, and iterative discussions, organizational recommendations were crafted and submitted to the ACGME. CONCLUSION: EM educators believe that ACGME clinical and educational work hour standards negatively impact the learning environment and are not optimal for promoting patient safety or the development of resident professional citizenship.",

    "abstract": "Multiple brain pathologies accumulate with age, but their underlying biology remains unclear. We investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in ten age-related cerebral pathologies. Using miRNA sequencing profiles from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 617 brain donors, we identified miRNAs associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, Lewy body pathology, arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and LATE-NC after adjusting for age, sex, and education. After additionally adjusting for co-existing cerebral pathologies, we found miRNAs specifically associated with AD pathology (n = 75), Lewy body pathology (n = 45), arteriolosclerosis (n = 3), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 1), and LATE-NC (n = 4). While some miRNAs were pathology-specific, 14 miRNAs (including those in the miR-132/212 cluster) were associated with both AD pathology and Lewy body pathology, and one (miR-193a-5p) was associated with both AD pathology and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that miRNAs associated with arteriolosclerosis target genes involved in glutathione metabolism, synaptic functions, cellular transport, and innate immune response. These findings highlight the role of miRNAs in age-related cerebral pathologies and provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and influence many biological processes. Despite their importance, understanding of how genetic variation affects miRNA expression in the brain and how this relates to brain disorders remains limited. Here we investigated these questions by identifying microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (miR-QTLs), or genetic variants associated with brain miRNA levels, using genome-wide small RNA sequencing profiles from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of 604 older adult donors of European ancestry. Here we show that nearly half (224 of 470) of the analyzed miRNAs have associated miR-QTLs, many of which fall in regulatory regions such as brain promoters and enhancers. We also demonstrate that intragenic miRNAs often have genetic regulation independent from their host genes. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with 16 genome-wide association studies of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, we identified miRNAs that likely contribute to bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. These findings advance understanding of the genetic regulation of miRNAs and their role in brain health and disease.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) have a broad influence on gene expression; however, we have limited insights into their contribution to rate of cognitive decline over time or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given this, we tested associations of 528 miRNAs with cognitive trajectory, AD hallmark pathologies, and AD clinical diagnosis using small RNA sequencing from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 641 community-based donors. We found 311 miRNAs differentially expressed in AD or its endophenotypes after adjusting for technical and sociodemographic variables. Among these, 137 miRNAs remained differentially expressed after additionally adjusting for several co-occurring age-related cerebral pathologies, suggesting that some miRNAs are associated with the traits through co-occurring pathologies while others through mechanisms independent from pathologies. Pathway enrichment analysis of downstream targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs found enrichment in transcription, postsynaptic signalling, cellular senescence, and lipoproteins. In sex-stratified analyses, five miRNAs showed sex-biased differential expression for one or more AD endophenotypes, highlighting the role that sex has in AD. Lastly, we used Mendelian randomization to test whether the identified differentially expressed miRNAs contribute to the cause or are the consequence of the traits. Remarkably, 15 differentially expressed miRNAs had evidence consistent with a causal role, laying the groundwork for future mechanistic studies of miRNAs in AD and its endophenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Aging ushers in numerous disruptions to autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Although the effects of aging on ANS function at rest are well characterized, there is surprising variation in reports of age-related differences in ANS reactivity to psychosocial stressors, with some reports of decreases and other reports of increases in reactivity with age. The sources of variation in age-related differences are largely unknown. Nonhuman primate models of socioaffective aging may help to uncover sources of this variation as nonhuman primates share key features of human ANS structure and function and researchers have precise control over the environments in which they age. In this report, we assess how response patterns to dynamic socioaffective stimuli in the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) ANS differ in aged compared to middle-aged monkeys. We find that respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a cardiac indicator of activity in the parasympathetic branch of the ANS, exhibits age-related disruptions in responding while monkeys view videos of conspecifics. This suggests that there are evolutionarily conserved mechanisms responsible for the patterns of affective aging observed in humans and that aged rhesus monkeys are a robust translational model for human affective aging.",

    "abstract": "Many challenges during pregnancy can disrupt fetal development and have varying consequences on the subsequent psychological development of infants. Notably, exposure to infectious pathogens during fetal development, such as those encountered in viral pandemics, has been associated with persistent developmental consequences on infants' brains and behavior. However, the underlying mechanisms and the degree to which neural plasticity over infancy may accommodate fetal insults remain unclear. To address this gap, we investigated the interaction between affective processing and decision-making in a cohort of rhesus monkey juveniles exposed to Zika virus (ZIKV) during fetal development, a pathogen known to profoundly disrupt central nervous system development. Ten juveniles exposed to ZIKV during their fetal development and nine procedure-matched controls (CONs) completed a judgment bias task with and without a negative mood induction. Although ZIKV exposure did not impact the monkeys' decision-making processes during the task or the magnitude of their behavioral responses to the mood induction procedure, it did alter the influence of mood induction on decision-making. Although CON monkeys exhibited significantly more conservative decision-making following negative mood induction, the decision-making of Zika-exposed monkeys remained consistent among conditions. These findings suggest that fetal exposure to ZIKV impacts the neural systems involved in integrating affective and cognitive information, with potential long-term implications for learning, memory, and emotion regulation.",

    "abstract": "Prior evidence demonstrates that relative to younger adults, older human adults exhibit attentional biases toward positive and/or away from negative socioaffective stimuli (i.e., the age-related positivity effect). Whether or not the effect is phylogenetically conserved is currently unknown and its biopsychosocial origins are debated. To address this gap, we evaluated how visual processing of socioaffective stimuli differs in aged, compared to middle-aged, rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) using eye tracking in two experimental designs that are directly comparable to those historically used for evaluating attentional biases in humans. Results of our study demonstrate that while younger rhesus possesses robust attentional biases toward threatening pictures of conspecifics' faces, aged animals evidence no such bias. Critically, these biases emerged only when threatening faces were paired with neutral and not ostensibly \"positive\" faces, suggesting social context modifies the effect. Results of our study suggest that the evolutionarily shared mechanisms drive age-related decline in visual biases toward negative stimuli in aging across primate species.

    "abstract": "There is enormous variation in the extent to which fetal Zika virus (fZIKV) infection affects the developing brain. Despite the neural consequences of fZIKV infection observed in people and animal models, many open questions about the relationship between infection dynamics and fetal and infant development remain. To further understand how ZIKV affects the developing nervous system and the behavioral consequences of prenatal infection, we adopted a nonhuman primate model of fZIKV infection in which we inoculated pregnant rhesus macaques and their fetuses with ZIKV in the early second trimester of fetal development. We then tracked their health across gestation and characterized infant development across the first month of life. ZIKV-infected pregnant mothers had long periods of viremia and mild changes to their hematological profiles. ZIKV RNA concentrations, an indicator of infection magnitude, were higher in mothers whose fetuses were male, and the magnitude of ZIKV RNA in the mothers' plasma or amniotic fluid predicted infant outcomes. The magnitude of ZIKV RNA was negatively associated with infant growth across the first month of life, affecting males' growth more than females' growth, although for most metrics, both males and females evidenced slower growth rates as compared with control animals whose mothers were not ZIKV inoculated. Compared with control infants, fZIKV infants also spent more time with their mothers during the first month of life, a social behavior difference that may have long-lasting consequences on psychosocial development during childhood.",

    "abstract": "Despite many observations of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity related to cognition and affect in humans and nonhuman animals, little is known about the causal role of the ACC in psychological processes. Here, we investigate the causal role of the ACC in affective responding to threat in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), a species with an ACC largely homologous to humans in structure and connectivity. Male adult monkeys received bilateral ibotenate axon-sparing lesions to the ACC (sulcus and gyrus of areas 24, 32, and 25) and were tested in two classic tasks of monkey threat processing: the human intruder and object responsiveness tasks. Monkeys with ACC lesions did not significantly differ from controls in their overall mean reactivity toward threatening or novel stimuli. However, while control monkeys maintained their reactivity across test days, monkeys with ACC lesions reduced their reactivity toward stimuli as days advanced. Critically, this attenuated reactivity was found even when the stimuli presented each day were novel, suggesting that ACC lesions did not simply cause accelerated adaptation to stimuli as they became less novel over repeated presentations. Rather, these results imply that the primate ACC is necessary for maintaining appropriate affective responses toward potentially harmful and/or novel stimuli. These findings therefore have implications for mood disorders in which responding to threat and novelty is disrupted.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Decades of research in humans and nonhuman animals have investigated the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in a huge number and variety of psychological processes spanning cognition and affect, as well as in psychological and neurologic diseases. The structure is broadly implicated in psychological processes and mental and neurologic health, yet its causal role in these processes has largely gone untested, particularly in primates. Here we demonstrate that when anterior cingulate cortex is completely eliminated, rhesus monkeys are initially responsive to threats, but these responses attenuate rather than persist, resembling a pattern of behavior commonly seen in patients diagnosed with mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a prevalent and deadly disease, particularly in its advanced stages. Despite various available treatments, resistance to drugs like enzalutamide continues to present significant challenges. This study aimed to investigate the role of Galectin-1 (Gal-1) in enzalutamide-resistant PCa and assess its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome resistance. METHODS: The study utilized specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gal-1 in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells to evaluate its effects on cell proliferation and response to enzalutamide treatment. An orthotopic mouse model was employed to examine the in vivo impact of Gal-1 knockdown. Pharmacological targeting of Gal-1 was conducted using LLS30, and its effects were assessed both in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated significant upregulation of Gal-1 in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. Gal-1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and resensitized resistant cells to enzalutamide treatment in the orthotopic mouse model. Elevated levels of androgen receptor full-length and AR-V7 are key mechanisms under-lying resistance to enzalutamide in PCa. Gal-1 knockdown suppressed AR and AR-V7 expression and their transcriptional activity. Treatment with LLS30 significantly suppressed the growth of enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells and exhibited synergistic effects when combined with enzalutamide. Notably, this combination therapy significantly inhibited the growth of enzalutamide-resistant xenografts in vivo. RNA-seq analysis revealed that LLS30 modulates AR and AR-V7 signaling through the inhibition of associated target genes. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight Gal-1 as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming enzalutamide resistance in PCa. Targeting the Gal-1/AR/AR-V7 axis with LLS30 presents a novel strategy to enhance enzalutamide efficacy and address drug resistance in advanced PCa.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) variants associated with androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) resistance and metastasis remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the axon guidance semaphorin receptor PlexinD1 as a crucial driver of cancer aggressiveness in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). High PlexinD1 expression in human PCa is correlated with adverse clinical outcomes. PlexinD1 critically maintains CRPC aggressive behaviors in vitro and in vivo, and confers stemness and cellular plasticity to promote multilineage differentiation including a neuroendocrine-like phenotype for ARSI resistance. Mechanistically, PlexinD1 is upregulated upon relief of AR-mediated transcriptional repression of PlexinD1 under ARSI treatment, and subsdquently transactivates ErbB3 and cMet via direct interaction, which triggers the ERK/AKT pathways to induce noncanonical Gli1-dictated Hedgehog signaling, facilitating the growth and plasticity of PCa cells. Blockade of PlexinD1 by the protein inhibitor D1SP restricted CRPC growth in multiple preclinical models. Collectively, these findings characterize PlexinD1's contribution to PCa progression and offer a potential PlexinD1-targeted therapy for advanced PCa.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is a lethal prostate cancer subtype that generally coexists with invasive high-grade prostate acinar adenocarcinoma (PAC) but exhibits distinct biological features compared with concomitant adenocarcinoma. In this study, we performed whole-exome, RNA, and DNA-methylation sequencing of IDC-P, concurrent invasive high-grade PAC lesions, and adjacent normal prostate tissues isolated from 22 radical prostatectomy specimens. Three evolutionary patterns of concurrent IDC-P and PAC were identified: early divergent, late divergent, and clonally distant. In contrast to those with a late divergent evolutionary pattern, tumors with clonally distant and early divergent evolutionary patterns showed higher genomic, epigenomic, transcriptional, and pathologic heterogeneity between IDC-P and PAC. Compared with coexisting PAC, IDC-P displayed increased expression of adverse prognosis-associated genes. Survival analysis based on an independent cohort of 505 patients with metastatic prostate cancer revealed that IDC-P carriers with lower risk International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1-4 adenocarcinoma displayed a castration-resistant free survival as poor as those with the highest risk ISUP grade 5 tumors that lacked concurrent IDC-P. Furthermore, IDC-P exhibited robust cell-cycle progression and androgen receptor activities, characterized by an enrichment of cellular proliferation-associated master regulators and genes involved in intratumoral androgen biosynthesis. Overall, this study provides a molecular groundwork for the aggressive behavior of IDC-P and could help identify potential strategies to improve treatment of IDC-P. SIGNIFICANCE: The genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic characterization of concurrent intraductal carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the prostate deepens the biological understanding of this lethal disease and provides a genetic basis for developing targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "The site of Iita in northwestern Greenland had near-continual occupation from 1000 CE to the mid-twentieth century, which presents an unparalleled opportunity to examine diachronic changes in the use of marine mammals for food and raw material resources by Pre-Inuit (Late Dorset) and Inuit–Inughuit—two culturally distinct Indigenous groups. Limited wood in High Arctic environments necessitated the use of antler, bone, and ivory for tool making. Choices in the selection and processing of osseous material reflect changes in the way these two groups used the same resources. However, modification of osseous material during the toolmaking process is often to such an extent that few diagnostic features remain for species identification. Here, we include Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) to identify typically indeterminate pieces of manufacturing debris from preserved collagen. The minimally destructive extraction technique using polishing films had a 99% success rate. The results suggest that selection of raw materials from certain marine mammals, particularly narwhal, by toolmakers at Iita was more frequent than previously understood through traditional faunal analysis alone. There is a paucity of narwhal from the Pre-Inuit (Late Dorset) assemblage, which contrasts starkly with the high frequency of narwhal in the Inuit–Inughuit assemblage. We demonstrate the importance of combining the analysis of bone-tool manufacturing debris with traditional dietary faunal remains to improve our understanding of resource use in coastal environments.",

We present faunal and botanical analyses of sediment samples collected from Ganigak (49-NOB-001; 1185–1465 cal CE), Norton Sound, from a “fish layer” identified by J. Louis Giddings in his excavation trench in 1948. Findings reveal that saffron cod and salmonberries were a crucial resource. Although these food items have low caloric yields, we argue that both provide essential nutrients to supplement marine-mammal dominant diets. Drawing on ethnographic accounts, we argue that saffron cod were crucial fallback resources, likely harvested by women and were relied on in times of resource scarcity. These data shed novel insight into Thule coastal subsistence strategies, which may otherwise be overlooked when the focus is on analysis of tool technologies or on unscreened faunal samples. Future research requires additional processing of sediment samples to fully understand the role of small-bodied fauna and plant foods to Thule subsistence strategies.",

    "abstract": "Artifact and settlement data suggest that precolonial subsistence strategies in northwestern Alaska went through an economic transition with increased importance placed on local fish and small game between AD 1400 and AD 1500. From a North American Arctic perspective, this process has been defined as “regionalization.” Here, we present results from a zooarchaeological analysis of over 31,700 faunal remains from the Shaktoolik Airport Site (NOB-072), a large multicomponent precolonial village site adjacent to the Native Village of Shaktoolik in Norton Sound, Alaska. Faunal specimens were derived from 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) screened and bulk sediment samples taken from midden deposits generated during two distinct archaeological or cultural phases from AD 1280 to the mid-1800s: 1) Nukleet, a regional variant of the Western Thule culture, and 2) three chronological periods associated with precolonial Yup’ik occupations. Comparison among archaeological deposits indicates that faunal assemblage composition varies spatially across the site and likely represents discrete seasonal activity areas. Faunal remains from bulk sediment samples also highlight the importance of small forage fish and shellfish, further emphasizing the need for sampling sites using fine-mesh screening. Based on our analysis, precolonial Yup’ik subsistence strategies diversified around AD 1500, coinciding with a broader regionalization trend. This shift may have been in response to the onset of the Little Ice Age (AD 1500–1850), but it could also have been in response to demographic pressure from increased regional populations.",

    "abstract": "Norton culture (ca. 740 BC–AD 1000) sites are ubiquitous across the western Arctic. Based on artifact and settlement data, it is generally agreed that Norton culture south of Seward Peninsula possessed a mixed marine-focused economy dominated by seasonally available Pacific salmon. However, the few direct studies of Norton subsistence, thus far, have suggested an emphasis on marine mammals rather than salmon. We present the results of a zooarchaeological midden analysis from the large Norton site of Difchahak (49-NOB-005) near Shaktoolik on Norton Sound, Alaska. We argue the faunal remains recovered from this site reflect its local estuarine system. Inhabitants were able to maintain year-round occupation of the region through an expansion of netting technology to non-salmon prey species. The economic focus at Difchahak was on mass capture of several seasonally available taxa, including salmon, mussels, saffron cod, ptarmigan, ducks, geese, and seal. Comparison of these faunal remains to those from Norton culture deposits at the neighboring site of Iyatayet suggests that differences between the localities are largely driven by geographically dependent prey-species distributions, and these two sites may represent complementary parts to a broad logistical foraging system.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the dissemination of (mis)information on a social media platform in Pakistan. It combines an intervention to disseminate official information about the COVID-19 pandemic across the platform with a randomized experiment that measures the impact of fully controlling access to pandemic-related misinformation. The two treatments rely on a higherintensity, ex-ante approach to moderating misinformation on the platform relative to the control, which relies on a more standard ex-post approach to moderation. In one treatment, no misinformation was allowed on the platform, while in the other, it was allowed with an official rebuttal. Controlling misinformation, as in the treatments, reduces platform usage by 41%, indicating a distaste for moderation. Furthermore, the treatments reduce exposure to official information by 29% more than they reduce exposure to misinformation. A conceptual framework posits that these findings can be explained by the fact that, in this setting, official information is more trusted, and thus is more widely disseminated, relative to misinformation. We find evidence for two potential mechanisms for the observed distaste for moderation.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lung diseases are widespread worldwide. Pulmonary immunity plays a vital role against lung pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the pathogenesis, including the development of local immune responses to infection, is fundamental for developing interventions to control the viral infection. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized 11-14 days later. RESULTS: Tertiary lymphoid tissue was found in all SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. The number (13.9 vs 1.5 iPLT number/ lung cm2), size (25992 vs 13946 µm2) and total area (0.46 vs 0.02 mm2 iPLT/ lung cm2) of the lymphoid tissue aggregations were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals than that of normal controls. This induced pulmonary lymphoid tissues comprised B cells, T cells, CD169 macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells with evidence of lymphocyte priming and differentiation. DISCUSSION: The results suggest local immunity plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of pulmonary immunity could lead to new interventions to develop vaccine strategies and discover new immune-regulatory biomarkers in monitoring and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and other lung diseases.",

    "abstract": "The injectable progestin depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is a popular contraceptive choice in sub-Saharan Africa although mouse models indicate it weakens genital epithelial integrity and barrier function and increases susceptibility to genital infection. The intravaginal ring NuvaRing® is another contraceptive option that like DMPA suppresses hypothalamic pituitary ovarian (HPO) axis function with local release of progestin (etonogestrel) and estrogen (ethinyl estradiol). As we previously reported that treating mice with DMPA and estrogen averts the loss of genital epithelial integrity and barrier function induced by DMPA alone, in the current investigation we compared genital levels of the cell-cell adhesion molecule desmoglein-1 (DSG1) and genital epithelial permeability in rhesus macaques (RM) treated with DMPA or a NuvaRing®re-sized for RM (N-IVR). While these studies demonstrated comparable inhibition of the HPO axis with DMPA or N-IVR, DMPA induced significantly lower genital DSG1 levels and greater tissue permeability to intravaginally administered low molecular mass molecules. By identifying greater compromise of genital epithelial integrity and barrier function in RM administered DMPA vs. N-IVR, our results add to the growing body of evidence that indicate DMPA weakens a fundamental mechanism of anti-pathogen host defense in the female genital tract.",

    "abstract": "Identifying immune correlates of protection is a major challenge in AIDS vaccine development. Anti-Envelope antibodies have been considered critical for protection against SIV/HIV (SHIV) acquisition. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of an SHIV vaccine against SIVmac251 challenge, where the role of antibody was excluded, as there was no cross-reactivity between SIV and SHIV envelope antibodies. After 8 low-dose intrarectal challenges with SIVmac251, 12 SHIV-vaccinated animals demonstrated efficacy, compared with 6 naive controls, suggesting protection was achieved in the absence of anti-envelope antibodies. Interestingly, CD8+ T cells (and some NK cells) were not essential for preventing viral acquisition, as none of the CD8-depleted macaques were infected by SIVmac251 challenges. Initial investigation of protective innate immunity revealed that protected animals had elevated pathways related to platelet aggregation/activation and reduced pathways related to interferon and responses to virus. Moreover, higher expression of platelet factor 4 on circulating platelet-leukocyte aggregates was associated with reduced viral acquisition. Our data highlighted the importance of innate immunity, identified mechanisms, and may provide opportunities for novel HIV vaccines or therapeutic strategy development.",

Tissue samples and plasma or serum samples, if available, were tested for viral RNA (vRNA) using a real time PCR system for the presence of virus RNA. All samples were tested in quadruplicate for both subgenomic (sgRNA) and genomic (gRNA) RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene. Amplification of a cellular housekeeping gene served as the positive control for every sample. A total of 47 tissue samples from 17 donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Four donors had plasma or serum available for paired testing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from any tissue or plasma/serum sample tested.

Vaxplas transiently enhanced disease severity and lung pathology in hamsters treated near peak viral replication due to immune complex and activated complement deposition in pulmonary endothelium, and recruitment of M1 proinflammatory macrophages into the lung parenchyma. However, aside from one report, transient enhanced disease has not been reported in CCP recipient patients, and the transient enhanced disease in Vaxplas hamsters may have been due to mismatched species IgG-FcR interactions, infusion timing, or other experimental factors. Despite transient disease enhancement, Vaxplas dramatically reduced virus replication in lungs and improved infection outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters.",

A meticulous preoperative workup with an extensive history, physical exam, and appropriate imaging are instrumental to ensure a successful operation. Protocolized postoperative care is also essential to garnish the most benefit from this minimally invasive approach.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mitochondrial impairments have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) based on analysis of mitochondria in peripheral tissues and cultured cells. We sought to assess whether mitochondrial abnormalities present in postmortem brain tissues of patients with FXTAS are also present in plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) from living carriers of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein1 (FMR1) gene premutations at an early asymptomatic stage of the disease continuum. METHODS: We utilized postmortem frozen cerebellar and frontal cortex samples from a cohort of eight patients with FXTAS and nine controls and measured the quantity and activity of the mitochondrial proteins complex IV and complex V. In addition, we evaluated the same measures in isolated plasma NDEVs by selective immunoaffinity capture targeting L1CAM from a separate cohort of eight FMR1 premutation carriers and four age-matched controls. RESULTS: Lower complex IV and V quantity and activity were observed in the cerebellum of FXTAS patients compared to controls, without any differences in total mitochondrial content. No patient-control differences were observed in the frontal cortex. In NDEVs, FMR1 premutation carriers compared to controls had lower activity of Complex IV and Complex V, but higher Complex V quantity. INTERPRETATION: Quantitative and functional abnormalities in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes IV and V seen in the cerebellum of patients with FXTAS are also manifest in plasma NDEVs of FMR1 premutation carriers. Plasma NDEVs may provide further insights into mitochondrial pathologies in this syndrome and could potentially lead to the development of biomarkers for predicting symptomatic FXTAS among premutation carriers and disease monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Brain changes at the end-stage of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) are largely unknown due to mobility impairment. We conducted a postmortem MRI study of FXTAS to quantify cerebrovascular disease, brain atrophy and iron content, and examined their relationships using principal component analysis (PCA). Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was observed in 4/17 FXTAS cases, among which one was confirmed by histologic staining. Compared with seven control brains, FXTAS cases showed higher ratings of T2-hyperintensities (indicating cerebral small vessel disease) in the cerebellum, globus pallidus and frontoparietal white matter, and significant atrophy in the cerebellar white matter, red nucleus and dentate nucleus. PCA of FXTAS cases revealed negative associations of T2-hyperintensity ratings with anatomic volumes and iron content in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala, that were independent from a highly correlated number of regions with ICH and iron content in subcortical nuclei. Post-hoc analysis confirmed PCA findings and further revealed increased iron content in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala in FXTAS cases compared to controls, after adjusting for T2-hyperintensity ratings. These findings indicate that both ischemic and hemorrhagic brain damage may occur in FXTAS, with the former being marked by demyelination/iron depletion and atrophy, and the latter by ICH and iron accumulation in basal ganglia.",

While neuronal contribution to FXS has been extensively studied in both animal and human-based models of FXS, the roles of astrocytes, a type of glial cells in the brain, are largely unknown. Here, we generated a human-based FXS model via differentiation of astrocytes from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and characterized their development, function, and proteomic profiles. We identified shortened cell cycle, enhanced Ca2+ signaling, impaired sterol biosynthesis, and pervasive alterations in the proteome of FXS astrocytes. Our work identified astrocytic impairments that could contribute to the pathogenesis of FXS and highlight astrocytes as a novel therapeutic target for FXS treatment.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of protein synthesis is one of the key mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the role of a major pathway controlling protein synthesis, the integrated stress response (ISR), in ASD remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the main arm of the ISR, eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α), is suppressed in excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS; Fmr1-/y). We further show that the decrease in p-eIF2α is mediated via activation of mTORC1. Genetic reduction of p-eIF2α only in excitatory neurons is sufficient to increase general protein synthesis and cause autism-like behavior. In Fmr1-/y mice, restoration of p-eIF2α solely in excitatory neurons reverses elevated protein synthesis and rescues autism-related phenotypes. Thus, we reveal a previously unknown causal relationship between excitatory neuron-specific translational control via the ISR pathway, general protein synthesis, and core phenotypes reminiscent of autism in a mouse model of FXS.",

    "abstract": "The premutation of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene is characterized by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeats (55 to 200 CGGs) in the 5' untranslated region and increased levels of FMR1 mRNA. Molecular mechanisms leading to fragile X-premutation-associated conditions (FXPAC) include cotranscriptional R-loop formations, FMR1 mRNA toxicity through both RNA gelation into nuclear foci and sequestration of various CGG-repeat-binding proteins, and the repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN)-initiated translation of potentially toxic proteins. Such molecular mechanisms contribute to subsequent consequences, including mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death. Clinically, premutation carriers may exhibit a wide range of symptoms and phenotypes. Any of the problems associated with the premutation can appropriately be called FXPAC. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), and fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND) can fall under FXPAC. Understanding the molecular and clinical aspects of the premutation of the FMR1 gene is crucial for the accurate diagnosis, genetic counseling, and appropriate management of affected individuals and families. This paper summarizes all the known problems associated with the premutation and documents the presentations and discussions that occurred at the International Premutation Conference, which took place in New Zealand in 2023.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To perform a multicenter study to assess growth failure in hospitalized infants with gastroschisis. STUDY DESIGN: This study included neonates with gastroschisis within sites in the University of California Fetal Consortium. The study's primary outcome was growth failure at hospital discharge, defined as a weight or length z score decrease >0.8 from birth. Regression analysis was performed to assess changes in z scores over time. RESULTS: Among 125 infants with gastroschisis, the median gestational age was 37 weeks (IQR 35-37). Length of stay was 32 days (23-60); 55% developed weight or length growth failure at discharge (28% had weight growth failure, 42% had length growth failure, and 15% had both weight and length growth failure). Weight and length z scores at 14 days, 30 days, and discharge were less than birth (P < .01 for all). Weight and length z scores declined from birth to 30 days (-0.10 and -0.11 z score units/week, respectively, P < .001). Length growth failure at discharge was associated with weight and length z score changes over time (P < .05 for both). Lower gestational age was associated with weight growth failure (OR 0.70 for each gestational age week, 95% CI 0.55-0.89, P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Growth failure, in particular linear growth failure, is common in infants with gastroschisis. These data suggest the need to improve nutritional management in these infants.",

    "abstract": "Background Prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease has been associated with early-term delivery and cesarean delivery (CD). We implemented a multi-institutional standardized clinical assessment and management plan (SCAMP) through the University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium. Our objective was to decrease early-term (37-39 weeks) delivery and CD in pregnancies complicated by fetal congenital heart disease using a SCAMP methodology to improve practice in a high-risk and clinically complex setting. Methods and Results University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium site-specific management decisions were queried following SCAMP implementation. This contemporary intervention group was compared with a University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium historical cohort. Primary outcomes were early-term delivery and CD. A total of 496 maternal-fetal dyads with prenatally diagnosed congenital heart disease were identified, 185 and 311 in the historical and intervention cohorts, respectively. Recommendation for later delivery resulted in a later gestational age at delivery (38.9 versus 38.1 weeks, P=0.01). After adjusting for maternal age and site, historical controls were more likely to have a CD (odds ratio [OR],1.8; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P=0.004) and more likely (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3) to have an early-term delivery than the intervention group. Vaginal delivery was recommended in 77% of the cohort, resulting in 61% vaginal deliveries versus 50% in the control cohort (P=0.03). Among pregnancies with major cardiac lesions (n=373), vaginal birth increased from 51% to 64% (P=0.008) and deliveries ≥39 weeks increased from 33% to 48% (P=0.004). Conclusions Implementation of a SCAMP decreased the rate of early-term deliveries and CD for prenatal congenital heart disease. Development of clinical pathways may help standardize care, decrease maternal risk secondary to CD, improve neonatal outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cause of most fetal anomalies is not determined prenatally. Exome sequencing has transformed genetic diagnosis after birth, but its usefulness for prenatal diagnosis is still emerging. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF), a fetal abnormality that is often lethal, has numerous genetic causes; the extent to which exome sequencing can aid in its diagnosis is unclear. METHODS: We evaluated a series of 127 consecutive unexplained cases of NIHF that were defined by the presence of fetal ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, skin edema, cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency, or a combination of these conditions. The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing for detecting genetic variants that were classified as either pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to the criteria of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of cases associated with specific genetic disorders and the proportion of variants that were inherited. RESULTS: In 37 of the 127 cases (29%), we identified diagnostic genetic variants, including those for disorders affecting the RAS-MAPK cell-signaling pathway (known as RASopathies) (30% of the genetic diagnoses); inborn errors of metabolism and musculoskeletal disorders (11% each); lymphatic, neurodevelopmental, cardiovascular, and hematologic disorders (8% each); and others. Prognoses ranged from a relatively mild outcome to death during the perinatal period. Overall, 68% of the cases (25 of 37) with diagnostic variants were autosomal dominant (of which 12% were inherited and 88% were de novo), 27% (10 of 37) were autosomal recessive (of which 95% were inherited and 5% were de novo), 1 was inherited X-linked recessive, and 1 was of uncertain inheritance. We identified potentially diagnostic variants in an additional 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In this large case series of 127 fetuses with unexplained NIHF, we identified a diagnostic genetic variant in approximately one third of the cases.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Numerous etiologies may lead to nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF), and the underlying cause often remains unclear. We aimed to determine the proportion of NIHF cases in which the etiology was clearly determined in a large, contemporary, and diverse cohort, as well as to describe the etiologies with a focus on genetic causes. METHODS: Retrospective review of NIHF cases between 2015 and 2017 from the five University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium sites. Singleton pregnancies with prenatally diagnosed NIHF were included, and cases with maternal alloimmunization were excluded. Cases were categorized as being of confirmed, suspected, or unknown etiology. RESULTS: Sixty-five NIHF cases were identified. Forty-six percent (30/65) remained of unknown etiology, while 9.2% (6/65) had a suspected etiology and 44.6% (29/65) were of confirmed etiology. Among confirmed cases, 11 resulted from aneuploidy; 7 from fetal structural anomalies; 2 each from fetal arrhythmia, Noonan syndrome, and generalized lymphatic dysplasia; and 1 each from arthrogryposis, parvovirus, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, fetal goiter, and Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. CONCLUSION: In this contemporary, multicenter study, the cause of prenatally diagnosed NIHF was confirmed in only 44% of cases, and a genetic etiology was found in only 25% of those that received standard of care genetic testing.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Antiplatelet medications interfere with hemostasis which can contribute to increased risk of hematoma expansion and potentially worse outcomes in patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhages (ICH). Current Neurocritical Care Society guidelines recommend desmopressin (DDAVP) in patients with antiplatelet-associated ICH with evidence limited by small cohorts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were included in our multi-center, retrospective study if they had computed tomographic (CT) scan confirmed ICH and were taking antiplatelet medications. Patients were excluded if hospital length of stay was <24 h, administered DDAVP dose was <0.3 μg/kg, no follow-up head CT scan was performed within the first 24 h after baseline, major neurosurgical intervention was performed in between CT scans, or the injury was an acute on chronic ICH. The primary outcome was incidence of hematoma expansion (defined as >20 % increase from baseline). Secondary outcomes were incidence of thrombotic complications within 7 days, largest absolute decrease in serum sodium within the first 24 h, and patient disposition. RESULTS: Among the 209 patients included in the study, 118 patients received DDAVP while 91 did not. The frequency of hematoma expansion was similar between patients who received DDAVP and those who did not (16.1 % vs 17.6 %; P = 0.78). No difference in secondary outcomes was observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings in conjunction with recently published literature may suggest minimal benefit or harm with DDAVP treatment. However, further study could elucidate any potential impact on long-term function outcomes.",

    "issued": "2023-02",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The presence of traumatic intraventricular hemorrhage (tIVH) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with worse neurological outcome. The mechanisms by which patients with tIVH have worse outcome are not fully understood and research is ongoing, but foundational studies that explore prognostic factors within tIVH populations are also lacking. This study aimed to further identify and characterize demographic and clinical variables within a subset of patients with TBI and tIVH that may be implicated in tIVH outcome. METHODS: In this observational study, we reviewed a large prospective TBI database to determine variables present on admission that predicted neurological outcome 6 months after injury. A review of 7,129 patients revealed 211 patients with tIVH on admission and 6-month outcome data. Hypothesized risk factors were tested in univariate analyses with significant variables (p < 0.05) included in logistic and linear regression models. Following the addition of either the Rotterdam computed tomography or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, we employed a backward selection process to determine significant variables in each multivariate model. RESULTS: Our study found that that hypotension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.94, p = 0.04) and the hemoglobin level (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.09-1.63, p = 0.006) were significant predictors in the Rotterdam model, whereas only the hemoglobin level (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.06-1.56, p = 0.01) was a significant predictor in the GCS model. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents one of the largest investigations into prognostic factors for patients with tIVH and demonstrates that admission hemoglobin level and hypotension are associated with outcomes in this patient population. These findings add value to established prognostic scales, could inform future predictive modeling studies, and may provide potential direction in early medical management of patients with tIVH.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Identification of patients with mTBI at risk for developing persistent-post concussive syndromes should begin during the ED/inpatient evaluation due to frequent lack of post-discharge follow-up. The best method for evaluating cognitive deficits in these acute settings and how to utilize this information to optimize follow-up care is a matter of ongoing research. In this descriptive study, we present the cognitive profile of 214 hospitalized patients with mTBI using a novel cognitive and behavioral screener, the UCD-Cog. METHOD: A retrospective review of patients with mTBI requiring hospitalization who were enrolled in the UC Davis TBI Registry over the course of 1 year. RESULTS: Reasoning, executive function, and delayed recall were the most frequently impaired cognitive domains. GCS 13-14 was associated with higher numbers of impaired cognitive domains and frequencies of impairments in domains traditionally associated with post-concussive symptoms. Patients with abnormal UCD-Cog results, regardless of GCS, were recommended higher levels of post-discharge care and supervision. CONCLUSION: Inpatient cognitive profiles using the UCD-Cog were consistent with evaluations during the subacute/chronic phase of mTBI and supports the clinical utility of acute cognitive screeners for mTBI management. Future studies will determine how the acute cognitive assessments correlate with long-term mTBI outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cancers and neurological disorders are two major types of diseases. We previously developed a new concept termed \"Aberrant Cell Cycle Diseases\" (ACCD), revealing that these two diseases share a common mechanism of aberrant cell cycle re-entry. The aberrant cell cycle re-entry is manifested as kinase/oncogene activation and tumor suppressor inactivation, which are hallmarks of both tumor growth in cancers and neuronal death in neurological disorders. Therefore, some cancer therapies (e.g., kinase inhibition, tumor suppressor elevation) can be leveraged for neurological treatments. The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has so far approved 74 kinase inhibitors, with numerous other kinase inhibitors in clinical trials, mostly for the treatment of cancers. In contrast, there are dire unmet needs of FDA-approved drugs for neurological treatments, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke (IS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and others. In this review, we list these 74 FDA-approved kinase-targeted drugs and identify those that have been reported in preclinical and/or clinical trials for neurological disorders, with a purpose of discussing the feasibility and applicability of leveraging these cancer drugs (FDA-approved kinase inhibitors) for neurological treatments.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires are impacting communities globally, with California wildfires often breaking records of size and destructiveness. Knowing how communities are affected by these wildfires is vital to understanding recovery. We sought to identify impacted communities' post-wildfire needs and characterize how those needs change over time. The WHAT-Now study deployed a survey that was made publicly available for communities affected by the October 2017 Northern California wildfires or the accompanying smoke at beginning approximately four months post-fire with the vast majority completed by nine months post-fire. Among other questions, the survey asked an adult household member to report on their households' greatest need both one-week post-fire and at the time of survey. A total of 1461 households responded to these questions. Households reported many types of needs, with 154 responses that did not directly name needs but rather described how their households had been affected, which we classified as impacts. Four major themes were identified: physical, health, air, and information, each representing an array of varied specific needs or impacts. Physical needs (e.g. housing, food) were the most common (cited by more than 50% during the fires and about a third at the time of survey). The need for clean air was strong during the fires, but not months later, at the time of survey. In contrast, health needs were reported by a quarter of households during the fires. Needs that were reported at both times were categorized as 'persistent', and there were more persistent mental health needs over time compared to other health themes. Understanding the needs and impacts that arise during wildfires, their diversity and duration, and how they change over time is crucial to identifying types of assistance that are most needed during recovery efforts and when they are needed. Results presented here along with other wildfire needs assessments can be utilized to improve disaster preparedness, including for wildfire recovery.",

Measurements of the contributions of wildfire smoke to ambient air pollutants, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), at fine resolution scales would be valuable to public health research on climate vulnerable populations and compound climate risks. We estimate the influence of wildfire smoke emissions on daily PM2.5 at fine-resolution, 3 km, for California 2011–2020, using a geostatistical modeled ambient PM2.5 estimate and wildfire smoke plume data from NOAA Hazard Mapping System. Additionally, we compare this product with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) daily and annual standards for PM2.5 exposure. Our results show wildfires significantly influence PM2.5 in California and nearly all exceedances of the daily US EPA PM2.5 standard were influenced by wildfire smoke, while annual exceedances were increasingly attributed to wildfire smoke influence in recent years. This wildfire-influenced PM2.5 product can be applied to public health research to better understand source-specific air pollution impacts and assess the combination of multiple climate hazard risks.",

    "abstract": "Future climate change can cause more days with poor air quality. This could trigger more alerts telling people to stay inside to protect themselves, with potential consequences for health and health equity. Here, we study the change in US air quality alerts over this century due to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), who they may affect, and how they may respond. We find air quality alerts increase by over 1 mo per year in the eastern United States by 2100 and quadruple on average. They predominantly affect areas with high Black populations and leakier homes, exacerbating existing inequalities and impacting those less able to adapt. Reducing emissions can offer significant annual health benefits ($5,400 per person) by mitigating the effect of climate change on air pollution and its associated risks of early death. Relying on people to adapt, instead, would require them to stay inside, with doors and windows closed, for an extra 142 d per year, at an average cost of $11,000 per person. It appears likelier, however, that people will achieve minimal protection without policy to increase adaptation rates. Boosting adaptation can offer net benefits, even alongside deep emission cuts. New adaptation policies could, for example: reduce adaptation costs; reduce infiltration and improve indoor air quality; increase awareness of alerts and adaptation; and provide measures for those working or living outdoors. Reducing emissions, conversely, lowers everyone's need to adapt, and protects those who cannot adapt. Equitably protecting human health from air pollution under climate change requires both mitigation and adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is known to increase the frequency and intensity of hot days (daily maximum temperature ≥30°C), both globally and locally. Exposure to extreme heat is associated with numerous adverse human health outcomes. This study estimated the burden of heat-related illness (HRI) attributable to anthropogenic climate change in North Carolina physiographic divisions (Coastal and Piedmont) during the summer months from 2011 to 2016. Additionally, assuming intermediate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, future HRI morbidity burden attributable to climate change was estimated. The association between daily maximum temperature and the rate of HRI was evaluated using the Generalized Additive Model. The rate of HRI assuming natural simulations (i.e., absence of greenhouse gas emissions) and future greenhouse gas emission scenarios were predicted to estimate the HRI attributable to climate change. Over 4 years (2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015), we observed a significant decrease in the rate of HRI assuming natural simulations compared to the observed. About 3 out of 20 HRI visits are attributable to anthropogenic climate change in Coastal (13.40% [IQR: -34.90,95.52]) and Piedmont (16.39% [IQR: -35.18,148.26]) regions. During the future periods, the median rate of HRI was significantly higher (78.65%: Coastal and 65.85%: Piedmont), assuming a higher emission scenario than the intermediate emission scenario. We observed significant associations between anthropogenic climate change and adverse human health outcomes. Our findings indicate the need for evidence-based public health interventions to protect human health from climate-related exposures, like extreme heat, while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.",

The relevance of heat wave definitions (HWDs) could change across health conditions and geographies due to the heterogenous climate profile. This study compared the sensitivity of 28 HWDs associated with HRI emergency department visits over five summer seasons (2011−2016), stratified by two physiographic regions (Coastal and Piedmont) in North Carolina. The HRI rate ratios associated with heat waves were estimated using the generalized linear regression framework assuming a negative binomial distribution. We compared the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values across the HWDs to identify an optimal HWD. In the Coastal region, HWDs based on daily maximum temperature with a threshold > 90th percentile for two or more consecutive days had the optimal model fit. In the Piedmont region, HWD based on the daily minimum temperature with a threshold value > 90th percentile for two or more consecutive days was optimal. The HWDs with optimal model performance included in this study captured moderate and frequent heat episodes compared to the National Weather Service (NWS) heat products. This study compared the HRI morbidity risk associated with epidemiologic-based HWDs and with NWS heat products. Our findings could be used for public health education and suggest recalibrating NWS heat products.",

A growing evidence base of open trials and comparison studies support PC-CARE's benefits, but no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of its effectiveness exist. The current study presents the first RCT of PC-CARE, a 7-session dyadic parenting intervention (trial number removed for blind review). Participants included a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 49 children (29% female) aged 2-10 years and their caregivers. Participants were randomly assigned to PC-CARE or waitlist control. Families participating in PC-CARE showed greater reductions in children's externalizing behaviors, improvements in children's adaptive skills, declines in parental stress, and increases in parents' positive communication skills, compared to families on the waitlist. The results of this first RCT of PC-CARE support the effectiveness of this brief intervention in improving children's behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Latinx families may be particularly vulnerable to emotional dysfunction, due to higher rates of economic hardship and complex social influences in this population. Little is known about the impact of environmental stressors such as unmet social needs and maternal stress on the emotional health of Latinx children from low-income families. We conducted secondary analyses using survey and biomarker data from 432 Latinx children and mothers collected in a separate study. We used binomial and multinomial logistic regression to test if household social needs, or maternal perceived stress or hair cortisol concentration (HCC), predicted child measures of emotional functioning or child HCC, independent of relevant sociodemographic factors. Approximately 40% of children in the sample had symptoms consistent with emotional dysfunction, and over 37% of households reported five or more social needs. High perceived maternal stress predicted higher odds of child emotional dysfunction (OR = 2.15; 95% CI [1.14, 4.04]; p = 0.01), and high maternal HCC was positively associated with high child HCC (OR = 10.60; 95% CI [4.20, 26.74]; p < 0.01). Most individual household social needs, as well as the level of household social need, were not independently associated with child emotional dysfunction or child HCC. Our findings begin to define a framework for understanding emotional health, stress, and resilience when caring for Latinx children and mothers living with high levels of social need, and the need for integrated mental health and social needs screening and interventions in settings that serve this population.",

Almost half the sample reported four or more household social needs. Social needs cumulatively and independently predicted increased odds of frequent emotional problems or perceived stress. Lower acculturation predicted lower odds of frequent emotional problems. There is increased risk for emotional problems and stress in low-income Latinx mothers who experience high social need.

Because of its flexible assumptions, the approach enables us to conduct a notably harder test of the “low-dimensionality” hypothesis than is found in previous work. The results support the proposition that a basic space (consisting of a small number of interwoven issue domains) anchors the policy dimension of public opinion. Among our findings, we show that voters—especially those meeting a minimum threshold of political so-phistication—neither lack meaningful attitudes nor hold distinct preferences across a wide range of issues. Rather, their policy attitudes are organized alongside relevant core values and affective evaluations in a common, low-dimensional cognitive space. A unidimensional approximation of these belief structures often exhausts the explanatory power of vote choice models.",

Unfortunately, existing regression-based approaches are ill-suited to explore the complex combinations of demographic, policy, and political factors that produce swing voters in American elections. This gap between theory and practice motivates our use of an ensemble of supervised machine learning methods to predict swing voters in the 2012, 2016, and 2020 U.S. presidential elections. The results from the learning ensemble substantiate the existence of swing voters in contemporary American elections. Specifically, we demonstrate that the learning ensemble produces well-calibrated and externally valid predictions of swing voter propensity in later elections and for related behaviors such as split-ticket voting. Although interpreting black-box models is more challenging, they can nonetheless provide meaningful substantive insights meriting further exploration. Here, we use flexible model-agnostic tools to perturb the ensemble and demonstrate that cross-pressures (particularly those involving ideological and policy-related considerations) are essential to accurately predict swing voters.</jats:p>",

To test the ideological structure of US public opinion, I develop and implement a Bayesian dynamic ordinal item response theory model. In contrast to static scaling procedures, this method allows for changes in the mappings between issue attitudes and the underlying ideological dimension over time. The results indicate that over the last forty years, mass attitudes on a range of long-standing policy controversies better fit a unidimensional ideological structure. As among elites, the left–right dimension has come to encompass a wide range of policy, partisan, and value divides in the mass public. Further, these trends hold for voters at all levels of political sophistication. Widespread conflict extension appears to be a defining feature of mass polarization in contemporary US politics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In the context of principal components analysis (PCA), the bootstrap is commonly applied to solve a variety of inference problems, such as constructing confidence intervals for the eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix Σ. However, when the data are high-dimensional, there are relatively few theoretical guarantees that quantify the performance of the bootstrap. Our aim in this paper is to analyze how well the bootstrap can approximate the joint distribution of the leading eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix Σ, b and we establish non-asymptotic rates of approximation with respect to the multivariate Kolmogorov metric. Under certain assumptions, we show that the bootstrap can achieve a dimension-free rate of r(Σ)/√n up to logarithmic factors, where r(Σ) is the effective rank of Σ, and n is the sample size. From a methodological standpoint, we show that applying a transformation to the eigenvalues of Σb before bootstrapping is an important consideration in high-dimensional settings.",

    "abstract": "Although there is an extensive literature on the eigenvalues of high-dimensional sample covariance matrices, much of it is specialized to independent components (IC) models—in which observations are represented as linear transformations of random vectors with independent entries. By contrast, less is known in the context of elliptical models, which violate the independence structure of IC models and exhibit quite different statistical phenomena. In particular, very little is known about the scope of bootstrap methods for doing inference with spectral statistics in high-dimensional elliptical models. To fill this gap, we show how a bootstrap approach developed previously for IC models can be extended to handle the different properties of elliptical models. Within this setting, our main theoretical result guarantees that the proposed method consistently approximates the distributions of linear spectral statistics, which play a fundamental role in multivariate analysis. We also provide empirical results showing that the proposed method performs well for a variety of nonlinear spectral statistics.",

In the setting where the eigenvalues of Σ have a decay profile of the form (Formula presented), we analyze how well the bootstrap can approximate the distribution of Tn . Our main result shows that up to factors of log(n), the bootstrap can approximate the distribution of Tn with respect to the Kolmogorov metric at the rate of (Formula presented), which does not depend on the ambient dimension p. In addition, we offer a supporting result of independent interest that establishes a high-probability upper bound for Tn based on flexible moment assumptions. More generally, we discuss the consequences of our work beyond covariance matrices, and show how the bootstrap can be used to estimate the errors of sketching algorithms in randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA). An illustration of these ideas is also provided with a climate data example.",

    "issued": "2023-01-01",
    "abstract": "Random Fourier Features (RFF) is among the most popular and broadly applicable approaches for scaling up kernel methods. In essence, RFF allows the user to avoid costly computations on a large kernel matrix via a fast randomized approximation. However, a pervasive difficulty in applying RFF is that the user does not know the actual error of the approximation, or how this error will propagate into downstream learning tasks. Up to now, the RFF literature has primarily dealt with these uncertainties using theoretical error bounds, but from a user's standpoint, such results are typically impractical-either because they are highly conservative or involve unknown quantities. To tackle these general issues in a data-driven way, this paper develops a bootstrap approach to numerically estimate the errors of RFF approximations. Three key advantages of this approach are: (1) The error estimates are specific to the problem at hand, avoiding the pessimism of worst-case bounds. (2) The approach is flexible with respect to different uses of RFF, and can even estimate errors in downstream learning tasks. (3) The approach enables adaptive computation, so that the user can quickly inspect the error of a rough initial kernel approximation and then predict how much extra work is needed. Lastly, in exchange for all of these benefits, the error estimates can be obtained at a modest computational cost.",

The proposed method proceeds via the construction of simultaneous confidence regions for the differences of population mean vectors. It is suited to simultaneously test the equality of several pairs of mean vectors of potentially more than two populations. By exploiting the variance decay property that is a natural feature in relevant applications, we are able to provide dimension-free and nearly parametric convergence rates for Gaussian approximation, bootstrap approximation, and the size of the test. We demonstrate the proposed approach with ANOVA problems for functional data and sparse count data. The proposed methodology is shown to work well in simulations and several real data applications.",

Canonical SLs act as signals to microbes and plants, whereas noncanonical SLs are primarily plant hormones. The cytochrome P450 CYP722C catalyzes a critical step, converting CLA to canonical SLs in most angiosperms. Using synthetic biology, we investigated the function of CYP722A, an evolutionary predecessor of CYP722C. CYP722A converts CLA into 16-hydroxy-CLA (16-OH-CLA), a noncanonical SL detected exclusively in the shoots of various flowering plants. 16-OH-CLA application restores control of shoot branching to SL-deficient mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana and is perceived by the SL signaling pathway. We hypothesize that biosynthesis of 16-OH-CLA by CYP722A was a metabolic stepping stone in the evolution of canonical SLs that mediate rhizospheric signaling in many flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "KAI2 receptors, classified as plant α/β hydrolase enzymes, are capable of perceiving smoke-derived butenolide signals and endogenous yet unidentified KAI2-ligands (KLs). While the number of functional KAI2 receptors varies among land plant species, rice has only one KAI2 gene. Rice, a significant crop and representative of grasses, relies on KAI2-mediated Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbioses to flourish in traditionally arid and nutrient-poor environments. This study presents the first crystal structure of an active rice (Oryza sativa, Os) KAI2 hydrolase receptor. Our structural and biochemical analyses uncover grass-unique pocket residues influencing ligand sensitivity and hydrolytic activity. Through structure-guided analysis, we identify a specific residue whose mutation enables the increase or decrease of ligand perception, catalytic activity, and signal transduction. Furthermore, we investigate OsKAI2-mediated signaling by examining its ability to form a complex with its binding partner, the F-box protein DWARF3 (D3) ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation of the target substrate OsSMAX1, demonstrating the significant role of hydrophobic interactions in the OsKAI2-D3 interface. This study provides new insights into the diverse and pivotal roles of the OsKAI2 signaling pathway in the plant kingdom, particularly in grasses.",

    "abstract": "Adults hold a broad range of beliefs about intellectual ability. Key examples include beliefs about its malleability, its distribution in the population, whether high levels of it (\"brilliance\") are necessary for success, its origins, and its responsiveness to intervention. Here, we examined the structure and motivational significance of this network of consequential beliefs in a sample of elementary school-age children (5- to 11-year-olds, N = 231; 116 girls, 112 boys, three gender nonbinary children; predominantly White and Asian children from relatively high-income backgrounds). We assessed five beliefs: (a) growth mindsets (malleability), (b) universal mindsets (distribution), (c) brilliance beliefs (necessity for success), and beliefs about ability's (d) innateness and (e) responsiveness to intervention. Even among the youngest children, these beliefs were empirically distinguishable and also largely coherent, in that they related to each other in expected ways. Moreover, the five beliefs assessed here were differentially related to children's learning (vs. performance) goals, preference for challenging tasks, and evaluative concern (i.e., concern that mistakes will lead others to evaluate the self negatively). Even when adjusting for age, children with growth mindsets were oriented toward learning goals and preferred challenging tasks; children who believed ability has innate origins preferred performance goals; and younger (but not older) children who thought success required brilliance expressed more concern over being evaluated. These findings speak to the multifaceted nature of children's concepts of ability and highlight their significance for children's achievement-related attitudes and behavior in the early school years.

    "abstract": "Beliefs about the malleability of intellectual ability-mindsets-shape achievement. Recent evidence suggests that even young children hold such mindsets; yet, no reliable and valid instruments exist for measuring individual differences in young children's mindsets. Given the potential relevance of mindsets to children's achievement-related behavior and learning, we developed and tested the psychometric properties of the Growth Mindset Scale for Children (GM-C). Among other psychometric properties, we assessed this instrument's (a) factor structure, (b) measurement invariance, (c) internal consistency, (d) temporal stability (test-retest reliability), (e) concurrent validity, and (f) cross-cultural robustness in samples of US children (Study 1; N = 220; ages 4 through 6; 50% girls; 39% White) and South African children (Study 2; predominantly grades 4 and 5; N = 331; 54% girls; 100% non-White). The GM-C scale exhibited four factors, representing beliefs about the instability of low ability, the malleability of low ability, the instability of high ability, and the malleability of high ability. The GM-C scale also demonstrated invariance across age, acceptable internal consistency (αs between .70 to .90), and moderate temporal stability over approximately one month (rs between .38 to .72). Concurrent validity was supported by significant relations between children's scores on the subscales about low ability and their goal orientations (Studies 1 and 2), challenge-seeking behavior, and achievement in math and English (Study 2). These findings suggest that the GM-C scale is a promising tool for measuring mindsets in young children. We offer practical recommendations for using this new scale and discuss theoretical implications.",

    "abstract": "Educational outcomes remain highly unequal within and across nations. Students' mindsets-their beliefs about whether intellectual abilities can be developed-have been identified as a potential lever for making adolescents' academic outcomes more equitable. Recent research, however, suggests that intervention programs aimed at changing students' mindsets should be supplemented by programs aimed at the changing the mindset culture, which is defined as the shared set of beliefs about learning in a school or classroom. This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical origin of the mindset culture and examines its potential to reduce group-based inequalities in education. In particular, experiments have identified two broad ways the mindset culture is communicated by teachers: via informal messages about growth (e.g., that all students will be helped to learn and succeed), and formal opportunities to improve (e.g., learning-focused grading policies and opportunities to revise and earn credit). New field experiments, applying techniques from behavioral science, have also revealed effective ways to influence teachers' culture-creating behaviors. This paper describes recent breakthroughs in the U.S. educational context and discusses how lessons from these studies might be applied in future, global collaborations with researchers and practitioners.",

    "abstract": "The nature of play in animals has been long debated, but progress is being made in characterizing play and its variants, documenting its distribution across vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, describing its mechanisms and development, and proposing testable theories about its origins, evolution, and adaptive functions. To achieve a deeper understanding of the functions and evolution of play, integrative and conceptual advances are needed in neuroscience, computer modeling, phylogenetics, experimental techniques, behavior development, and inter- and intra-specific variation. The special issue contains papers documenting many of these advances. Here, we describe seven timely areas where further research is needed to understand this still enigmatic class of phenomena more fully. Growing empirical and theoretical evidence reveals that play has been crucial in the evolution of behavior and psychology but has been underestimated, if not ignored, in both empirical and theoretical areas of evolutionary biology and neuroscience. Play research has important ramifications for understanding the evolution of cognition, emotion, and culture, and research on animals can be both informative and transformative.",

    "abstract": "Play is phylogenetically widespread, and there are many proposed theories and fitness benefits of play. However, we still need a theoretical framework that unifies our understanding of the benefits that facilitated the evolution of play in so many diverse species. Starting with von Uexküll's theory of the Umwelt (i.e., the sensory-motor worlds of animals), together with the behavior systems approach, we propose that the Umwelt is an information processing system that serves basic biological functions. During development, the Umwelt undergoes a rapid expansion in the sensory and motor stimuli it processes. We argue that play is a process that converts surplus resources into information. By increasing the information content of the developing Umwelt, play confers fitness benefits. To demonstrate that play could evolve based on its information benefits, we present a model and simulation results of the evolution of a social play learning process that provides fitness-enhancing information in adult cooperative and competitive situations. Finally, we discuss this information-theoretic framework in relation to proposed hypotheses and fitness benefits of play.",

    "issued": "2022",
    "abstract": "The social organization of groups varies greatly across primate species, ranging from egalitarian to despotic. Moreover, the typical or average size of groups varies greatly across primate species. Yet we know little about how group size affects social organization across primate species. Here we used the hawk-dove game (HDG) to model the evolution of social organization as a function of maximum group size and used the evolved frequency of hawks as a measure of egalitarian/despotism in societies. That is, the lower the frequency of hawks, the more egalitarian a society is, and the higher the frequency of hawks, the more despotic it is. To do this, we built an agent-based model in which agents live in groups and play the HDG with fellow group members to obtain resources to reproduce offspring. Offspring inherit the strategy of their parent (hawk or dove) with a low mutation rate. When groups reach a specified maximum size, they are randomly divided into two groups. We show that the evolved frequency of hawks is dramatically lower for relatively small maximum group sizes than predicted analytically for the HDG. We discuss the relevance of group size for understanding and modeling primate social systems, including the transition from hunter-gather societies to agricultural societies of the Neolithic era. We conclude that group size should be included in our theoretical understanding of the organization of primate social systems.",

    "issued": "2021-07-30",
    "abstract": "People are often generous even when it is not in their apparent self-interest to do so as demonstrated by numerous experiments using the dictator game (DG). More recent research using DGs has varied the number of dictators and recipients and used these games to investigate the bystander effect and congestible altruism. These studies have found that people are less generous when there are others who could be generous (the bystander effect) and also less generous when there are multiple recipients (congestible altruism) though the sum of their generosity to all recipients increases. A working hypothesis is proposed that the context-sensitive generosity observed in n-person DGs can be explained as equitable behavior. From an evolutionary perspective, explaining the evolution of equitable behavior is challenging at best. To provide an evolutionary explanation, a second working hypothesis is proposed: equitable offers evolve because they reduce resource deficits produced by variability in the accumulation of resources and thereby minimize the length of interbirth intervals (IBIs) and increase fitness. Based on this working hypothesis, an evolutionary model was developed for n-person DGs to investigate the evolution of equitable offers as a resource allocation problem when reproduction is constrained by IBIs. Simulations demonstrated that equitable offers could evolve in group-structured populations when there is a cost (i.e., longer IBIs) to running resource deficits. Mean evolved offers also varied as a function of the number of dictators and recipients in patterns consistent with the bystander effect and congestible altruism. Equitable offers evolved because they reduced resource variability among group members and thereby reduced resource deficits, which insured higher average rates of reproduction for more equitable groups of agents. Implications of these results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Health and nutrition of individuals are tied to reproductive success, which determines population viability. Environmental variability and anthropogenic effects can affect the health and nutrition of a species leading to reproductive repercussions which can hinder recovery of endangered populations. Indices of health and nutrition were examined for an imperiled species, delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus, in relation to their reproductive status to evaluate the effects of hydrologic conditions in the San Francisco Estuary and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Adult delta smelt were collected by the Fall Midwater Trawl and Spring Kodiak Trawl during monthly monitoring surveys run by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife from 2011 to 2018 spanning from the head of the Carquinez strait to the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. The hydrologic conditions during this period ranged from high precipitation (2011 and 2017) to drought (2012-2016). Drought, via indirect effects from contaminant concentrations and food availability, is hypothesized to influence the health and reproductive success of delta smelt. Each individual was examined for size (length, weight, and condition factor), health (gill and liver pathology/indices), nutritional (RNA/DNA and liver glycogen depletion estimated histologically), and reproductive indicators (gonadosomatic indices [GSI], oocyte developmental stage, clutch size, oocyte size, and oocyte weight). Fork length and condition factor both had strong, positive correlations with reproduction. Glycogen depletion was correlated with higher oocyte mass, oocyte area and GSI, indicating females low in liver glycogen had higher reproductive metrics. Gill and liver lesion severity, which often increases with contaminant exposure, were negatively associated with oocyte area and GSI. Delta smelt in Suisun Marsh and Cache Slough had the longest fork length and highest condition factor measures. Delta smelt in Cache Slough had the highest reproductive metrics and proportion of post-spawned females and late-stage oocytes. Drought did not appear to influence reproduction but reduced population size.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater fishes are increasingly facing extinction. Some species will require conservation intervention such as habitat restoration and/or population supplementation through mass-release of hatchery fish. In California, USA, a number of conservation strategies are underway to increase abundance of the endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus); however, it is unclear how different estuarine conditions influence hatchery fish. The goal of this study was to evaluate a year of Delta Smelt field deployments to inform species conservation strategies of suitable conditions for smelt physiology. Hatchery-reared Delta Smelt was deployed in experimental cages (seven deployments) throughout the Estuary in the winter, summer and fall of 2019. Effects of season and location of cage deployments on fish health (condition factor and histological condition of liver and gill), growth, thermal tolerance and survival were evaluated. The results indicate both seasonal and location differences, with high survival in the winter (100%) and fall (88-92%) compared to lower survival in summer (67%). In the summer, one of the study sites had no surviving fish following high temperature exposure, which peaked ~26°C. After 29 days in the cages, surviving Delta Smelt in summer and fall showed signs of nutritional stress that may be related to biofouling of the cages limiting passive food inputs, restriction of natural foraging behaviour by containment in the cages, and water temperatures that were too high given the chronically low pelagic productivity in the Estuary overall. Field measurements of upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) following caging exposures suggest that laboratory measures of CTmax may overestimate the realized tolerance in a more stochastic field environment. This study demonstrates the utility of using cages as an experimental tool to better understand aspects of Delta Smelt physiological responses to environmental changes across estuarine habitats in a more natural-field setting, while also highlighting potential limitations of using cages.",

    "abstract": "Assessing habitat quality is a major goal of conservationists and restoration practitioners, but to associate habitat quality with biomarkers of vagile animals, the biomarkers must respond rapidly. Here, we identified a biomarker capable of rapidly detecting food limitation in the imperiled Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a pelagic fish endemic to the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). We conducted an experiment with fed and unfed treatments of hatchery-raised, sub-adult Delta Smelt that were sampled at 12 time points: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 21 days. We then compared four biomarkers using Day 21 fish: RNA/DNA in liver, triglycerides in liver, glycogen in liver, and glycogen in muscle. Of the liver endpoints, glycogen had the largest difference between treatments at Day 21, so we compared it to muscle glycogen across all time points. Liver glycogen declined by 60% after 1 day of fasting and remained depressed in the fasting treatment across all subsequent time points. Muscle glycogen also responded rapidly, taking only 2 days to decline by 39% in the fasting treatment, but the difference was inconsistent across subsequent time points. When applied to hatchery-released Delta Smelt collected from the SFE, liver glycogen concentrations were less than half that of the fed hatchery fish, consistent with the hypothesis of food limitation in the wild, but also several other potential causes. This study highlights the utility of liver glycogen as an indicator of recent foraging success in Delta Smelt.",

    "abstract": "The organochlorine pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is an endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC) that has been banned by most countries for decades. However, it continues to be detected in nearly all humans and wildlife due to its biological and environmental persistence. The ovarian dysgenesis syndrome hypothesis speculates that exposure to EDCs during sensitive developmental windows such as early gonadal differentiation lead to reproductive disorders later in life. Yet, mechanisms by which DDT affects developing gonads remain unclear due to the inherent challenge of getting developmental exposure data from adults presenting with reproductive disease. The Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a valuable fish model for sex-specific toxicological studies due to its chromosomal sex determination, external embryonic development, short generation time, and extensively mapped genome. It is well documented that medaka exposed to DDT and its metabolites and byproducts (herein referred to as DDT+) at different developmental time points experience permanent alterations in gonadal morphology, reproductive success, and molecular and hormonal signaling. However, the overwhelming majority of studies focus primarily on functional and morphological outcomes in males and females and have rarely investigated long-term transcriptional or molecular effects. This review summarizes previous experimental findings and the state of our knowledge concerning toxic effects DDT + on reproductive development, fertility, and health in the valuable medaka model. It also identifies gaps in knowledge, emphasizing a need for more focus on molecular mechanisms of ovarian endocrine disruption using enhanced molecular tools that have become increasingly available over the past few decades. Furthermore, DDT forms a myriad of over 45 metabolites and transformation products in biota and the environment, very few of which have been evaluated for environmental abundance or health effects. This reinforces the demand for high throughput and economical in vivo models for predictive toxicology screening, and the Japanese medaka is uniquely positioned to meet this need.",

    "abstract": "The Delta Smelt is a largely zooplanktivorous, endangered fish endemic to the San Francisco Estuary (the estuary). High flows increase the availability of fresh and brackish water habitat for Delta Smelt, but also may mobilize contaminants, potentially increasing toxicological stress. Here, we examine the association between contaminants and Delta Smelt health across contrasting water year types and flow-related management actions. Our study spanned the fall season of three years: 1 dry year (2018) bracketed by 2 wet years (2017 and 2019) and coincided with several management actions meant to benefit Delta Smelt. We collected field water from six sites in the estuary that encompass the freshwater and low-salinity habitat of Delta Smelt and analyzed the water for contaminant concentrations. After a 96-hour exposure to the field water, we assessed cultured Delta Smelt survival and the histopathological condition of the gill and liver. Insecticides, particularly fipronil metabolites, were the most prevalent contaminants detected in 2017 and 2018, and a variety of contaminants associated with the rice harvest were detected in 2019. No acute toxicity was observed during any exposure, but we observed negative effects in the livers of Delta Smelt exposed to agricultural water from the Toe Drain and Cache Slough during a 2019 pulse flow action, which coincided with elevated detections and concentrations of organic pesticides. Other noteworthy sub-lethal effects, likely occurring in response to contaminant mixtures, included severe gill lesions in Delta Smelt exposed to Decker Island water in 2019. In the drier year of 2018, lesions were generally mild or absent. Thus, the trade-offs between increased habitat availability and contaminant loading may provide one explanation for why Delta Smelt abundance does not consistently respond positively to outflow.",

    "issued": "2025",
    "abstract": "During the 3rd millennium BC, a series of oases located along the western foothills of the al-Hajar Mountains saw the establishment of intensive human occupation, associated with the construction of large buildings (the so-called “towers”) and residential structures. These settlements were supported by the onset of agriculture and their development was often associated with and made possible by the introduction of substantial water management systems, including simple wells and complex, large ditches. The oasis of Salūt, near Bisya in the central Sultanate of Oman, is one such Early Bronze Age (EBA) centre. There, extensive investigation of ancient hydraulic structures provided an opportunity to study contexts preserving significant information on ancient climate change and water availability, from the late 3rd to the second half of the 1st millennium BC. A geoarchaeological investigation targeted the huge ditch surrounding the EBA stone tower of Salūt-ST1. Its complete layout was revealed and large portions were fully excavated, allowing the documentation of its infillings and the geological substratum. At the same time, wells excavated at the bottom of the ditch witness the attempt to cope with the lowering water table at the turn of the 3rd millennium BC. Exploration of Iron Age (IA) wells, paired with the geoarchaeological study of sediments from the plain, further extended the chronological scope of the research, while a survey of the area identified ancient and more recent underground and open-air channels, including the exceptional radiometric dating for the introduction of the aflaj (the local term – plural – for the underground water tunnels) network serving the oasis in the late Holocene. This contribution presents the first synthesis including fresh data on how water was harvested and managed in the area of Salūt over almost two millennia, with a diachronic approach that finds little parallels in the region.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers are renowned for their accuracy in computer vision tasks but are computationally and memory expensive, making them challenging to deploy on resource-constrained edge devices. In our research paper, we introduce a revolutionary approach to designing energy-aware dynamically prunable Vision Transformers for use in edge applications. Our solution denoted as Incremental Resolution Enhancing Transformer (IRET), works by the sequential sampling of the input image. However, in our case, the embedding size of input tokens is considerably smaller than prior-art solutions. This embedding is used in the first few layers of the IRET vision transformer until a reliable attention matrix is formed. Then the attention matrix is used to sample additional information using a learnable 2D lifting scheme only for important tokens and IRET drops the tokens receiving low attention scores. Hence, as the model pays more attention to a subset of tokens for its task, its focus and resolution also increase. This incremental attention-guided sampling of input and dropping of unattended tokens allow IRET to significantly prune its computation tree on demand. By controlling the threshold for dropping unattended tokens and increasing the focus of attended ones, we can train a model that dynamically trades off complexity for accuracy. Moreover, using early exiting our model is capable of doing anytime prediction. This is especially useful for real-word energy-sensitive edge devices, where accuracy and complexity could be dynamically traded based on factors such as battery life, reliability, etc.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain, a leading reason people seek medical care, has become a social issue. Automated pain assessment has seen notable advancements over recent decades, addressing a critical need in both clinical and everyday settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this survey was to provide a comprehensive overview of pain and its mechanisms, to explore existing research on automated pain recognition modalities, and to identify key challenges and future directions in this field. METHODS: A literature review was conducted, analyzing studies focused on various modalities for automated pain recognition. The modalities reviewed include facial expressions, physiological signals, audio cues, and pupil dilation, with a focus on their efficacy and application in pain assessment. RESULTS: The survey found that each modality offers unique contributions to automated pain recognition, with facial expressions and physiological signals showing particular promise. However, the reliability and accuracy of these modalities vary, often depending on factors such as individual variability and environmental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: While automated pain recognition has progressed considerably, challenges remain in achieving consistent accuracy across diverse populations and contexts. Future research directions are suggested to address these challenges, enhancing the reliability and applicability of automated pain assessment in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of county-level social vulnerability on patients' decision to refuse recommended surgical treatment. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis conducted on HNSCC cases documented in the latest available SEER databases from 2000 to 2020; various demographic, including county of residence, and disease-related variables were collected. CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was assigned based on patients' county of residence, and patients were subsequently categorized into four SVI quartiles. Pearson chi-square tests and binomial logistic regression was conducted to determine the impact of variables on patients' refusal of surgical treatment. RESULTS: Among 83,184 patients, 2.6% (2,165) refused surgical intervention recommended by their physician as part of treatment. Social vulnerability (higher SVI), male sex, older age, more advanced disease stage, belonging to non-Hispanic Black or Native Hawaiian/Asian Pacific Islander Race and Origin, and single marital status were associated with higher likelihood of refusing surgery. CONCLUSION: SVI is a significant factor in the refusal of recommended surgical treatment in HNSCC patients. Advanced disease stages and social vulnerability appear to interplay, influencing treatment decisions. Culturally competent care and support for socially vulnerable patients may mitigate disparities in treatment acceptance, potentially improving survival outcomes.
