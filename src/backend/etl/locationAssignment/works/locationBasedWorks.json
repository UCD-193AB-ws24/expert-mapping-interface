    "abstract": "Wild-type avian encephalomyelitis virus AEV causes neurological signs in young chicks but no disease in pullets after oral or intracutaneous infection. However if the virus gets embryo-adapted by serial passaging in chicken embryos it will cause AE after intracutaneous infection in chickens of all ages. Recently several cases of AE in layer pullets occurring shortly after intracutaneous vaccination were described. The present investigation was initiated to determine if vaccines that had inadvertently been embryo-adapted were responsible for these outbreaks. Virus isolation was done from two vaccines and one field sample. One of the vaccines had been used in one of the flocks before the outbreak. After the first passage regardless of the inoculum no embryo was paralyzed indicating that the vaccines and the field isolate were not embryo-adapted. After seven passages all three strains were fully embryo-adapted causing typical lesions in the embryos. Viral load as determined by RT-qPCR remained constant during the passages. Partial sequences of the VP2 gene of vaccines the field sample and four other field isolates were nearly identical and highly similar to published sequences from all over the world only sequences originating from non-vaccinated birds were clearly set apart. Analysis of whole genomes identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs that distinguished wild-type and embryo-adapted strains. Sanger sequencing brains and nerves of the five field isolates and of the first third and fifth passages of the isolates showed that the mutations indicating embryo-adaptation were first observed in the fifth passage.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Telemedicine is increasingly used to provide outpatient pediatric neurology consultations in underserved communities. Although telemedicine clinics have been shown to improve access little is known about how they alter patients utilization of hospital services. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between access to telemedicine clinics and hospital utilization among underserved children with neurologic conditions. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cross-sectional study included 4169 patients who received outpatient care from pediatric neurologists affiliated with an academic childrens hospital in California between January 1 2009 and July 31 2017 either in person or using telemedicine. EXPOSURES Consultation modality telemedicine or in person in the outpatient neurology clinics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Demographic and clinical variables were abstracted from the hospitals electronic medical records. The association between the modality of outpatient neurology care and patients utilization of the emergency department and hospitalizations was evaluated. Both all-cause and neurologic condition-related hospital utilization were analyzed using multivariable negative binomial regression in overall and matched samples. RESULTS The telemedicine cohort comprised 378 patients 211 55.8 male and the in-person cohort comprised 3791 patients 2090 55.1 male. The mean SD age at the first encounter was 7.4 5.4 years for the telemedicine cohort and 7.8 5.1 years for the in-person cohort. The telemedicine cohort was more likely than the in-person cohort to have nonprivate insurance public insurance self-pay or uninsured lower education and lower household income. The rates of all-cause and neurologic hospital encounters were lower among children who received pediatric neurology consultations over telemedicine compared with children who received care in the in-person clinics 5.7 95 CI 3.5-8.0 vs 20.1 95 CI 18.1-22.1 per 100 patient-years and 3.7 95 CI 2.0-5.3 vs 8.9 95 CI 7.8-10.0 per 100 patient-years respectively P .001. Even after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors the telemedicine cohort had a lower risk of hospital encounters emergency department visits and admissions with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.57 95 CI 0.38-0.88 for all-cause encounters and an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.60 95 CI 0.36-0.99 for neurologic encounters. After matching on travel time to the neurology clinic the adjusted incidence rate ratio was 0.19 95 CI 0.04-0.83 for all-cause admissions and 0.14 95 CI 0.02-0.82 for neurologic admissions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Pediatric neurology care through real-time audiovisual telemedicine consultations was associated with lower hospital utilization compared with in-person consultations suggesting that high-cost hospital encounters can be prevented by improving subspecialty access.",

    "abstract": "The coenzyme A CoA transferases are a superfamily of proteins central to the metabolism of acetyl-CoA and other CoA thioesters. They are diverse group catalyzing over a 100 biochemical reactions and spanning all three domains of life. A deeply rooted idea proposed two decades ago is these enzymes fall into three families I II and III. Here we find they fall into different families which we achieve by analyzing all CoA transferases characterized to date. We manually annotated 94 CoA transferases with functional information including rates of catalysis for 208 reactions from 97 publications. This represents all enzymes we could find in the primary literature and it is double the number annotated in four protein databases BRENDA KEGG MetaCyc UniProt. We found family I transferases are not closely related to each other in terms of sequence structure and reactions catalyzed. This family is not even monophyletic. These problems are solved by regrouping the three families into six including one family with many non-CoA transferases. The problem and solution became apparent only by analyzing our large set of manually annotated proteins. It would have been missed if we had used the small number of proteins annotated in UniProt and other databases. Our work is important to understanding the biology of CoA transferases. It also warns investigators doing phylogenetic analyses of proteins to go beyond information in databases.",

    "abstract": "Caregiver coaching is an evidence-based practice for young autistic children but it is not widely used in community-based early intervention services. Previous research has explored why caregiver coaching is not widespread in early intervention but only from the perspective of early intervention providers. Caregivers providers and administrators are all involved in the decision of whether to use caregiver coaching in early intervention. Therefore it is important to include all perspectives in research regarding this practice. In this study we interviewed 20 caregivers of autistic children 36 early intervention providers and 6 administrators from early intervention agencies and asked questions about their perspectives regarding the use of caregiver coaching in early intervention. We did this to figure out what factors help and hinder the use of caregiver coaching in this setting and to see how caregivers providers and administrators agreed or disagreed on these factors. All participants agreed that caregivers attitudes and expectations can influence whether caregiver coaching is used. In addition all participants agreed that when caregivers and providers collaborate and have a strong working relationship it can facilitate the use of caregiver coaching in early intervention. Other factors such as caregiver stress and provider flexibility were also discussed. Based on these findings we suggest strategies that can be used to possibly increase the use of caregiver coaching in early intervention for autistic children and their families.",

    "abstract": "Anhidrosis is defined as a decreased or absent ability to sweat in response to heat and exercise. In horses this condition can increase the risk of life-threatening hyperthermia. A prior study has suggested that equine anhidrosis is associated with a missense variant rs68643109 in the Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily E Regulatory Subunit 4 KCNE4 gene. This project aimed to validate this association in a population of well-phenotyped horses and to determine the allele frequency of this variant in publicly available whole-genome sequence data. Fifty horses within the University of California Davis Center for Equine Health herd were evaluated for anhidrosis using a series of intradermal terbutaline injections. From existing whole-genome sequence data the rs68643109 genotype of each horse was identified. When stimulated with terbutaline all 50 horses produced sweat. All three genotypes at rs68643109 were present in this population of horses the allele previously associated with anhidrosis G was present at a frequency of 0.72. No statistical difference in total sweat score was found p 0.31. In whole-genome sequences from 820 other horses reported across three prior studies the alternative candidate allele frequency was similarly high ranging from 0.52 to 0.68. Since all 50 horses tested in our population produced sweat regardless of genotype and the previously associated allele is present at a high frequency across datasets these data fail to validate the missense variant within the KCNE4 gene as causative of or contributing to equine anhidrosis.",

    "abstract": "Seven half-day regional listening sessions were held between December 2016 and April 2017 with groups of diverse stakeholders on the issues and potential solutions for herbicideresistance management. The objective of the listening sessions was to connect with stakeholders and hear their challenges and recommendations for addressing herbicide resistance. The coordinating team hired Strategic Conservation Solutions LLC to facilitate all the sessions. They and the coordinating team used in-person meetings teleconferences and email to communicate and coordinate the activities leading up to each regional listening session. The agenda was the same across all sessions and included small-group discussions followed by reporting to the full group for discussion. The planning process was the same across all the sessions although the selection of venue time of day and stakeholder participants differed to accommodate the differences among regions. The listening-session format required a great deal of work and flexibility on the part of the coordinating team and regional coordinators. Overall the participant evaluations from the sessions were positive with participants expressing appreciation that they were asked for their thoughts on the subject of herbicide resistance. This paper details the methods and processes used to conduct these regional listening sessions and provides an assessment of the strengths and limitations of those processes.",

    "abstract": "Climatic warming is associated with organisms breeding earlier in the season than is typical for their species. In some species however response to warming is more complex than a simple advance in the timing of all life history events preceding reproduction. Disparities in the extent to which different components of the reproductive phenology of organisms vary with climatic warming indicate that not all life history events are equally responsive to environmental variation. Here we propose that our understanding of phenological response to climate change can be improved by considering entire sequences of events comprising the aggregate life histories of organisms preceding reproduction. We present results of a two-year warming experiment conducted on 33 individuals of three plant species inhabiting a low-arctic site. Analysis of phenological sequences of three key events for each species revealed how the aggregate life histories preceding reproduction responded to warming and which individual events exerted the greatest influence on aggregate life history variation. For alpine chickweed Cerastium alpinum warming elicited a shortening of the duration of the emergence stage by 2.5 days on average but the aggregate life history did not differ between warmed and ambient plots. For gray willow Salix glauca however all phenological events monitored occurred earlier on warmed than on ambient plots and warming reduced the aggregate life history of this species by 22 days on average. Similarly in dwarf birch Betula nana warming advanced flower bud set blooming and fruit set and reduced the aggregate life history by 27 days on average. Our approach provides important insight into life history responses of many organisms to climate change and other forms of environmental variation. Such insight may be compromised by considering changes in individual phenological events in isolation.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine whether the variability of cardiorespiratory measurements is smaller when administering desflurane at a multiple of the individuals minimum alveolar concentration MAC or at a predetermined identical concentration in all subjects. ANIMALS 10 dogs. PROCEDURES Desflurane was administered at 1.5 times the individuals MAC iMAC and 1.5 times the groups MAC gMAC. The order of concentrations was randomly selected. Heart rate respiratory rate arterial blood pressure central venous pressure mean pulmonary artery pressure pulmonary artery occlusion pressure arterial and mixed-venous blood gas tensions and pH and cardiac output were measured. The desflurane concentration required to achieve a mean arterial pressure MAP of 60 mm Hg was then determined. Finally the desflurane concentration required to achieve an end-tidal PCO2 of 55 mm Hg was measured. RESULTS Variances when administering 1.5 iMAC or 1.5 gMAC were not significantly different for any variable studied. Differences between the MAC multiples needed to reach an MAP of 60 mm Hg and the mean of the sample were significantly larger when gMAC was used compared with iMAC indicating that a multiple of iMAC better predicted the concentration resulting in a MAP of 60 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggest that in a small group of dogs variability in cardiorespiratory measurements among dogs is unlikely to differ whether an inhalant anesthetic is administered at a multiple of the iMAC in each dog or at an identical gMAC in all dogs.",

These results stem from a comprehensive synthetic approach described previously for the production of s-triazine haptens. Both homologous and heterologous ELISA systems were examined by using heterology based on hapten conjugation position spacer length andor alkyl substitution. Sensitivity to the target analyte and to nonspecific effects was least for homologous systems. Except for extreme differences in spacer length heterology based on conjugation position provided the largest improvement in sensitivity to the target analyte. Matrix and solvent effects depended on the ELISA system used. Specificity studies using several antibodies in competitive inhibition ELISA with over 30 inhibitors showed that conjugation position and alkyl substitutions were important determinants of antibody specificity and that the antibodies recognized the immunizing hapten better than all other inhibitors tested. The resulting assays were capable of detecting the parent and related s-triazines at low ppb to sub-ppb levels. 1991 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "CASE DESCRIPTION 4 cats 6 to 9 months old were evaluated because of clinical signs consistent with a portosystemic shunt PSS. CLINICAL FINDINGS Among the 4 cats 3 had neurologic abnormalities including ataxia head pressing disorientation and obtundation. One cat was evaluated because of urethral obstruction a retrieved urethral stone was determined to have urate composition. Clinicopathologic findings hypoproteinemia low BUN concentration and high serum bile acids concentration were consistent with a PSS in all cats. A diagnosis of intrahepatic PSS IHPSS was made for all cats on the basis of ultrasonographic and CT findings. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME All cats underwent percutaneous transvenous coil embolization PTCE. No major intraprocedural complications were encountered and all cats were discharged from the hospital. For the 3 cats that were presented with neurologic signs an evaluation performed at 12 14 or 48 months after the procedure revealed resolution of the neurologic signs and owners reported that the behavior of each cat appeared normal. One cat that initially had neurologic and gastrointestinal signs had lower urinary tract signs after PTCE and developed an acquired extrahepatic PSS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Although IHPSSs in cats are uncommon the outcomes of PTCE for the 4 cats of the present report suggested that this treatment may benefit cats with an IHPSS. No short-term complications were encountered and all cats had improvement in clinical signs following PTCE although an acquired extrahepatic PSS was later identified in 1 cat. Further investigation of the use of endovascular techniques for the treatment of IHPSSs in cats and other species is warranted.",

Most existing work is algorithm-specific limited to simple together and apart constraints and does not attempt to satisfy all constraints. This limits applications including where satisfying all constraints is required such as fairness. In this work we take the novel direction of post-processing the results of a clustering algorithm constrained or unconstrained as a combinatorial optimization problem to find the best allocation of instances to clusters whilst enforcing constraints. Experiments show that when evaluated on a ground truth our method is competitive in terms of clustering quality with the more recent approaches while being more computationally efficient. Finally since all constraints are satisfied our work can be applied to areas such as fairness including both group level and individual level fairness.",

The soil was a poorly drained Rocklin fine sandy loam with a hardpan that varied from 4.75 to I m from the surface at the northern end of the orchard shallow soil condition to no hardpan apparent to 2 m below the surface at the southern end of the orchard deep soil condition. Water deprivation during a the first exponential phase of fruit growth or stage I b lag phase of fruit growth or stage II c first half of stage II d second half of stage II e second exponential fruit growth phase or stage III and f postharvest was compared to a fully watered control. Water deprivation caused the most severe reduction in tree water status when it was imposed over longer periods of time and during periods of high evaporative demand and also had mm-e severe effects under shallow soil conditions. Compared to the control treatment deprivation during all of stage II the most severe deprivation treatment was associated with increased Ilowering reduced fruit hydration ratio and smaller fruit size under all soil conditions. Under deep soil conditions deprivation during all of stage II resulted in increased return bloom which was reflected in higher fruit loads and dry t-ha- fruit yield. However under shallow soil conditions even though return bloom was increased with this treatment fruit loads and dry thajatssup-1jatssup fruit yields were the lowest of all treatments. These differences in treatment effects in shallow vs. deep soil conditions were most likely the result of increased fruit drop which occurred under shallow soil conditions as a result of rapid onset and increased severity ofstress. Treatments that had parallel effects in shallow and deep soil conditions resulted in statistically significant overall treatment effects while those that had opposing effects in shallow vs. deep soil conditions did not show significant overall treatment effects. Substantial alternate hearing occurred and in general dry fruit yields above 9 dry thajatssup-1jatssup resulted in a decrease in fruit load the following year while loads below this value showed a subsequent increase. Based on a separate estimate of the theoretically stable value for each treatment all deprivation treatments resulted in a higher sustainable fruit load compared to the fully irrigated control. This suggests that for the purpose of prune fruit production there may be an optimal level of tree water stress.jatsp",

    "abstract": "The neocortex is the part of the brain that is involved in perception cognition and volitional motor control. In mammals it is a highly dynamic structure that has been dramatically altered in different lineages and these alterations account for the remarkable variations in behavior that species exhibit. When we consider how this structure changes and becomes more complex in some mammals such as humans we must also consider how the alterations that occur at macro levels of organization such as the level of the individual and social system as well as micro levels of organization such as the level of neurons synapses and molecules impact the neocortex. It is also important to consider the constraints imposed on the evolution of the neocortex. Observations of highly conserved features of cortical organization that all mammals share as well as the convergent evolution of similar features of organization indicate that the constraints imposed on the neocortex are pervasive and restrict the avenues along which evolution can proceed. Although both genes and the laws of physics place formidable constraints on the evolution of all animals humans have evolved a number of mechanisms that allow them to loosen these constraints and often alter the course of their own evolution. While this cortical plasticity is a defining feature of mammalian neocortex it appears to be exaggerated in humans and could be considered a unique derivation of our species.",

Mitochondria carrying the homoplasmic 11778ND4 3460ND1 and 14484ND6 mtDNA point mutations associated with LHON were used to generate osteosarcoma-derived cybrids. Enhanced mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species has recently been demonstrated in these cybrids Beretta S Mattavelli L Sala G Tremolizzo L Schapira AHV Martinuzzi A Carelli V Ferrarese C 2004 Brain 127 2183-2192. The aim of this study was to characterize the antioxidant defences of these LHON-affected cells. The activities of glutathione peroxidase GPx glutathione reductase GR superoxide dismutases SOD and catalase and the amounts of glutathione GSH and oxidized glutathione GSSG were measured in cybrids cultured both in glucose-rich medium and galactose-rich medium. The latter is known to cause oxidative stress and to trigger apoptotic death in these cells. In spite of reduced SOD activities in all LHON cybrids and of low GPx and GR activities in cells with the most severe 3460ND1 and 11778ND4 mutations GSH and GSSG content were not significantly modified in LHON cybrids cultured in glucose medium. In contrast in galactose GSSG concentrations increased significantly in all cells indicating severe oxidative stress whereas GR and MnSOD activities further decreased in all LHON cybrids. These data suggest that in cells carrying LHON mutations there is a decrease in antioxidant defences which is especially evident in cells with mutations associated with the most severe clinical phenotype. This is magnified by stressful conditions such as exposure to galactose.",

We attack this problem by studying a certain function constructed by BerlineVergne and its values on faces of a unimodularly equivalent copy of Tes n1 1 1. We develop a method of obtaining the dot products appeared in formulas for computing BerlineVergnes function directly from facet normal vectors.

Seven independent laboratories tested 76 identical heparin plasma samples collected from a cohort of pregnant women in Niger using the same 7-plex assay to assess differences in results across laboratories. In the analytical validation experiments intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were acceptable at 6 and 15 respectively and assay linearity was 96 to 99 with the exception of ferritin which had marginal performance in some tests. Cross-laboratory comparisons showed generally good agreement between laboratories in all analyte results for the panel of 76 plasma specimens with Lins concordance correlation coefficient values averaging 0.8 for all analytes. Excluding plates that would fail routine quality control QC standards the inter-assay variation was acceptable for all analytes except sTfR which had an average inter-assay coefficient of variation of 20.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Distal femoral metaphyseal surface morphology is highly variable in extant mammals. This variation has previously been linked to differences in locomotor behavior. We perform the first systematic survey and description of the development of this morphology in extant hominoids. MATERIALS AND METHODS We collected 3D surface laser scans of the femora of 179 human and great ape individuals throughout all subadult stages of development. We qualitatively and quantitatively describe metaphyseal surface morphology. RESULTS We find that the metaphysis is topographically simple in all hominoids during the fetal and infant periods relative to later developmental periods and in apes it develops significant complexity throughout development. Humans by contrast retain relatively flat metaphyseal surfaces throughout ontogeny. DISCUSSION Major shifts in morphology appear to coincide with major shifts in locomotor behavior suggesting that metaphyseal morphology is developmentally plastic and highly dependent on the biomechanical loadings at the knee joint. This is consistent with a large body of biomedical research which demonstrates the primacy of mechanical forces in determining growth plate ossification patterns. Additionally specific metaphyseal morphology appears highly correlated with specific locomotor modes suggesting that metaphyseal surface morphology will be useful for reconstructing the locomotor behavior of fossil primate taxa.",

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography OCT represents a noninvasive high axial resolution imaging technique that provides a unique insight for clinicians into structures of the normal and diseased human retina in vivo. Similar to all ophthalmic instruments imaging has to be performed through the optics of the eye i.e. cornea and lens which show natural imperfections and therefore introduce aberrations. In OCT this results in a degradation of transverse resolution limiting the instruments ability to detect small structures e.g. single cells. Adaptive optics AO is capable of compensating for these aberrations both static and dynamic to achieve nearly diffraction-limited transverse resolution. Therefore a combination of AO with OCT results in a powerful imaging system capable of resolving the cellular 3D architecture of the human retina in vivo. This review describes the basic principles of OCT and AO instruments as well as the integration of AO into OCT systems together with recent experimental results obtained with this new technology. Additionally the review includes a discussion of remaining technical problems associated with AOOCT in retinal imaging followed by an outlook of possible further developments. 2007 Future Drugs Ltd.

Among the assemblies that populate the amyloid formation process oligomers and short fibrils are the most cytotoxic. The human Hsc70-based disaggregase system can resolve -synuclein fibrils but its ability to target other toxic assemblies has not been studied. Here we show that this chaperone system preferentially disaggregates toxic oligomers and short fibrils while its activity against large less toxic amyloids is severely impaired. Biochemical and kinetic characterization of the disassembly process reveals that this behavior is the result of an all-or-none abrupt solubilization of individual aggregates. High-speed atomic force microscopy explicitly shows that disassembly starts with the destabilization of the tips and rapidly progresses to completion through protofilament unzipping and depolymerization without accumulation of harmful oligomeric intermediates. Our data provide molecular insights into the selective processing of toxic amyloids which is critical to identify potential therapeutic targets against increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorders.",

Santiago and colleagues are among the first to document four complications of acute kidney dysfunction in critically ill children catheterization-related insertion complications hypotension hemorrhage and electrolyte disturbances. They reported that hypotension at connection 41.3 and electrolyte disturbance 50.6 were the leading complications. Although this study is limited by small sample size and the outcome variables measured it is an important first step in assessing outcomes of CRRT in children. A prospective multicenter randomized trial will be needed to fully delineate the complications and define the riskbenefit ratio of CRRT in children.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To describe a technique for blind thoracoscopic-assisted double-lumen endobronchial tube DLT placement for achieving one-lung ventilation OLV using 3 different DLT designs and to evaluate whether thoracic auscultation could reliably confirm OLV in dogs. STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized study. ANIMALS Mature female hound dogs n 6. METHODS Physical examination baseline blood work and thoracic radiography confirmed the absence of preexisting disease in all dogs. Thoracoscopic observation was established through a subxiphoid portal and used for evaluation of differential lung lobe ventilation. Each dog was sequentially intubated using 1 of 3 DLT designs in random order Robertshaw left-sided tube RS-L Carlens left-sided tube C-L Dr. White right-sided tube DW-R. Incidence of initial and overall after a maximum of 3 DLT manipulations correct and complete OLV CC-OLV was recorded. After each blind thoracoscopic-assisted DLT placement bronchoscopic evaluation was performed to document correct DLT position. RESULT Blind DLT placement achieved overall CC-OLV in all dogs using RS-L 66 using C-L and all using DW-R. Successful initial left-sided OLV L-OLV was statistically more likely when RS-L DLTs were used compared to C-L or DW-R. Of cases where overall CC-OLV was achieved correct DLT position was present in only 44 of intubations. CONCLUSIONS Blind DLT placement produced successful CC-OLV in all dogs using at least one DLT design evaluated. Use of thoracoscopic assistance may obviate the need for bronchoscopic observation during DLT placement in dogs. However bronchoscopic observation may still refine DLT positioning in dogs after blind thoracoscopic-assisted DLT placement.",

    "abstract": "Commercialization of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for bio-based chemical production is problematic due to the high processing costs of pretreatment and saccharifying enzymes combined with low product yields. Such low product yield can be attributed in large part to the incomplete utilization of the various carbohydrate sugars found in the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study we demonstrate that Lactobacillus brevis is able to simultaneously metabolize all fermentable carbohydrates in acid pre-processed rice straw hydrolysate thereby allowing complete utilization of all released sugars. Inhibitors present in rice straw hydrolysate did not affect lactic acid production. Moreover the activity of exogenously added cellulases was not reduced in the presence of growing cultures of L. brevis. These factors enabled the use of L. brevis in a process termed simultaneous saccharification and mixed sugar fermentation SSMSF. In SSMSF with L. brevis sugars present in rice straw hydrolysate were completely utilized while the cellulase maintained its maximum activity due to the lack of feedback inhibition from glucose andor cellobiose. By comparison to a sequential hydrolysis and fermentation process SSMSF reduced operation time and the amount of cellulase enzyme necessary to produce the same amount of lactic acid.",

A contingency table framed by two histograms affords directional and mutual associations based on rescaled conditional Shannon entropies for any feature-pair. The heatmap of the mutual association matrix of all features becomes a roadmap showing which features are highly associative with which features. We develop our data analysis paradigm called categorical exploratory data analysis CEDA with this heatmap as a foundation. CEDA is demonstrated to provide new resolutions for two topics multiclass classification MCC with one single categorical response variable and response manifold analytics RMA with multiple response variables. We compute visible and explainable information contents with multiscale and heterogeneous deterministic and stochastic structures in both topics. MCC involves all feature-group specific mixing geometries of labeled high-dimensional point-clouds. Upon each identified feature-group we devise an indirect distance measure a robust label embedding tree LET and a series of tree-based binary competitions to discover and present asymmetric mixing geometries. Then a chain of complementary feature-groups offers a collection of mixing geometric pattern-categories with multiple perspective views. RMA studies a systems regulating principles via multiple dimensional manifolds jointly constituted by targeted multiple response features and selected major covariate features. This manifold is marked with categorical localities reflecting major effects. Diverse minor effects are checked and identified across all localities for heterogeneity. Both MCC and RMA information contents are computed for datas information content with predictive inferences as by-products. We illustrate CEDA developments via Iris data and demonstrate its applications on data taken from the PITCHfx database.",

    "abstract": "Although having a family history of breast cancer is a well established breast cancer risk factor it is not known whether it influences mortality after breast cancer diagnosis. We studied 4153 women with first primary incident invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1991 and 2000 and enrolled in the Breast Cancer Family Registry through population-based sampling in Northern California USA Ontario Canada and Melbourne and Sydney Australia. Cases were oversampled for younger age at diagnosis andor family history of breast cancer. Carriers of germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were excluded. Cases and their relatives completed structured questionnaires assessing breast cancer risk factors and family history of cancer. Cases were followed for a median of 6.5 years during which 725 deaths occurred. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate associations between family history of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and risk of all-cause mortality after breast cancer diagnosis adjusting for established prognostic factors. The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 0.98 95 confidence interval CI 0.84-1.15 for having at least one first- or second-degree relative with breast cancer and 0.85 95 CI 0.70-1.02 for having at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer compared with having no such family history. Estimates did not vary appreciably when stratified by case or tumor characteristics. In conclusion family history of breast cancer is not associated with all-cause mortality after breast cancer diagnosis for women without a known germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Therefore clinical management should not depend on family history of breast cancer.",

Here we demonstrate that it is an achievable goal to fold alphabeta proteins with a force field emphasizing the balance between the two major secondary structures. Using our newly developed force field we conducted extensive ab initio folding simulations on an alphabeta protein full sequence design FSD employing both conventional molecular dynamics and replica exchange molecular dynamics in combination with a generalized-Born solvation model. In these simulations the folding of FSD to the native state with high population 64.2 and high fidelity Calpha-Root Mean Square Deviation of 1.29 A for the most sampled conformation when compared to the experimental structure was achieved. The folding of FSD was found to follow two pathways. In the major pathway the folding started from the formation of the helix. In the minor pathway however folding of the beta-hairpin started first. Further examination revealed that the helix initiated from the C-terminus and propagated toward the N-terminus. The formation of the hydrophobic contacts coincided with the global folding. Therefore the hydrophobic force does not appear to be the driving force of the folding of this protein.",

In this note we provide strong evidence for a new striking property of the superamplitude which we conjecture to be true to all loop orders the amplitude form is positive when evaluated inside the amplituhedron. The statement is sensibly formulated thanks to the natural bosonization of the superamplitude associated with the amplituhedron geometry. However this positivity is not manifest in any of the current approaches to scattering amplitudes and in particular not in the cellulations of the amplituhedron related to on-shell diagrams and the positive grassmannian. The surprising positivity of the form suggests the existence of a dual amplituhedron formulation where this feature would be made obvious. We also suggest that the positivity is associated with an extended picture of amplituhedron geometry with the amplituhedron sitting inside a co-dimension one surface separating legal and illegal local singularities of the amplitude. We illustrate this in several simple examples obtaining new expressions for amplitudes not associated with any triangulations but following in a more invariant manner from a global view of the positive geometry.",

    "abstract": "Germanium selenide glasses of compositions spanning the whole glass-formation range are aged at room temperature for up to 20 years. A prominent enthalpy relaxation process is observed in all glasses and its structural origin is analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. The structural relaxation is manifested in the Raman spectra as a decrease in the ratio of edge- to corner-sharing GeSe42 tetrahedral units. This structural evolution can be explained in terms of configurational entropy and density changes. Changes in Raman features and enthalpy follow an identical stretched exponential relaxation function characteristic of aging in glasses. The compositional dependence of enthalpy relaxation after 20 years is in agreement with kinetic considerations based on the glass transition temperature of each glass. The relaxation behavior and heat capacity curves are consistent with standard glass relaxation models for all compositions. These results indicate that the non-reversing enthalpy obtained by modulated differential scanning calorimetry MDSC which suggests the existence of non-aging glasses is not a reliable measure of the ability of a glass to relax. Instead it is suggested that an interpretation of MDSC data in terms of complex heat capacity provides a more complete and reliable assessment of the relaxation properties of glasses.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Antibiotic resistance genes ARGs are considered to be emerging environmental contaminants of concern potentially posing risks to human and animal health and this research studied the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in dairy manure. METHODS This study is focused on investigating prevalence of ARGs in California dairy farm manure under current common different manure management. A total of 33 manure samples were collected from multiple manure treatment conditions 1 flushed manure FM 2 fresh pile FP 3 compost pile CP 4 primary lagoon PL and 5 secondary lagoon SL. After DNA extraction all fecal samples were screened by PCR for the presence of eight ARGs four sulfonamide ARGs sulI sulII sulIII sulA two tetracycline ARGs tetW tetO two macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B MLSB ARGs ermB ermF. Samples were also screened for two mobile genetic elements MGEs intI1 tnpA which are responsible for dissemination of ARGs. Quantitative PCR was then used to screen all samples for five ARGs sulII tetW ermF tnpA and intI1. RESULTS Prevalence of genes varied among sample types but all genes were detectable in different manure types. Results showed that liquid-solid separation piling and lagoon conditions had limited effects on reducing ARGs and MGEs and the effect was only found significant on tetW p 0.01. Besides network analysis indicated that sulII was associated with tnpA p 0.05 and Psychrobacter and Pseudomonas as opportunistic human pathogens were potential ARGMGE hosts p 0.05. This research indicated current different manure management practices in California dairy farms has limited effects on reducing ARGs and MGEs. Improvement of different manure management in dairy farms is thus important to mitigate dissemination of ARGs into the environment.",

While the advancement of green up and flowering are well-documented it remains unclear whether all phenophases particularly those later in the season will shift in unison or respond divergently to warming. Here we present the largest synthesis to our knowledge of experimental warming effects on tundra plant phenology from the International Tundra Experiment. We examine the effect of warming on a suite of season-wide plant phenophases. Results challenge the expectation that all phenophases will advance in unison to warming. Instead we find that experimental warming caused 1 larger phenological shifts in reproductive versus vegetative phenophases and 2 advanced reproductive phenophases and green up but delayed leaf senescence which translated to a lengthening of the growing season by approximately 3. Patterns were consistent across sites plant species and over time. The advancement of reproductive seasons and lengthening of growing seasons may have significant consequences for trophic interactions and ecosystem function across the tundra.",

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB and adjustable gastric banding AGB are dominant surgical techniques but RYGB is the only publicly insured procedure in all Canadian provinces. Private clinics currently offer AGB with minimal wait times. We sought to compare RYGB in public facilities with AGB in private clinics in terms of cost wait times and certain aspects of patient care. METHODS We conducted telephone interviews of all bariatric surgery providers across Canada 100 response rate. We asked about various aspects of care such as wait time cost pre- and postoperative care and surgeon experience. RESULTS The median out-of-pocket cost for AGB at private facilities is 16000 range 13160-18375. Private clinics have much shorter wait times for AGB than public facilities do for RYGB 1 v. 21 mo p 0.001. Private clinics provide significantly fewer preoperative visits with multidisciplinary health professionals 2.7 v. 4.3 p 0.045 and 5 of 12 42 private clinics conduct AGB surgeries without on-site critical care for high-risk based on the respondents definitions patients. CONCLUSION Private clinics performing AGB offer short wait times but the cost is high. We found a great deal of variation between pre- and postoperative care among bariatric surgery facilities and in some cases patient care appears to be less comprehensive. Our findings suggest that further research on obesity treatment is needed to inform policy so that all Canadians can have equitable and timely access to proven evidence-based care.",

The data are taken from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey DEEP2 and COMBO-17. The use of clustering allows us to determine what fraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellite galaxies. At all redshifts including z 0 the data are consistent with 60 of satellite galaxies being red or quenched implying that 13 of the red sequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. More than three-fourths of red satellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted onto a larger halo. The constant fraction of satellite galaxies that are red yields a quenching time for satellite galaxies that depends on redshift in the same way as halo dynamical times tQ 1 z-1.5..In three of the four samples the data favor a model in which red central galaxies are a random sample of all central galaxies there is no preferred halo mass scale at which galaxies make the transition from star-forming to red and dead. The large errors on the fourth sample inhibit any conclusions. Theoretical models in which star formation is quenched above a critical halo mass are excluded by these data. A scenario in which mergers create red central galaxies imparts a weaker correlation between halo mass and central galaxy color but even the merger scenario creates tension with red galaxy clustering at redshifts above 0.5. These results suggest that the mechanism by which central galaxies become red evolves from z 0.5 to z 0. 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.",

We then consider the classification of all quotients of the maximally supersymmetric ten-dimensional plane wave under a spacelike isometry and show that the quotient will lead to closed timelike curves iff the isometry involves a translation along the u direction. The appearance of these closed timelike curves is thus connected to the special properties of the light cones in plane wave space-times.

With the increased use of multielectrode recording techniques synchronous firing of ensembles of neurons has been found at all levels in the mammalian visual pathway from the retina to the extrastriate cortex.

The authors examined the risk of overall mortality associated with marital status across racialethnic groups and sex in data from the California Cancer Registry. METHODS California Cancer Registry data for all first primary invasive cancers diagnosed from 2000 through 2009 for the 10 most common sites of cancer-related death for non-Hispanic whites NHWs blacks AsiansPacific Islanders APIs and Hispanics were used to estimate multivariable hazard ratios HRs and 95 confidence intervals CIs for marital status in relation to overall mortality by raceethnicity and sex. The study cohort included 393470 male and 389697 female cancer patients and 204007 and 182600 deaths from all causes respectively through December 31 2012. RESULTS All-cause mortality was higher in unmarried patients than in married patients but there was significant variation by raceethnicity. Adjusted HRs 95 CIs ranged from 1.24 95 CI 1.23-1.26 in NHWs to 1.11 95 CI 1.07-1.15 in APIs among males and from 1.17 95 CI 1.15-1.18 in NHWs to 1.07 95 CI 1.04-1.11 in APIs among females. All-cause mortality associated with unmarried status compared with married status was higher in US-born API and Hispanic men and women relative to their foreign-born counterparts. CONCLUSIONS For patients who have the cancers that contribute most to mortality being unmarried is associated with worse overall survival compared with being married with up to 24 higher mortality among NHW males but only 6 higher mortality among foreign-born Hispanic and API females. Future research should pursue the identification of factors underlying these associations to inform targeted interventions for unmarried cancer patients.

All the compounds in this homologous series crystallize in the C2m space group and can be described as Pavonite structures. This structure type consists of alternating NaCl-like layers with varied thickness nP separated by a pair of square pyramids. All the compounds reported here are synthetic analogues of the n 4 pavonite family and are known as makovickyite minerals. Compounds I-III possess complex crystal structures consisting of mixed occupancies of BiAgPb sites as well as partially occupied Cu sites. These intrinsic assets lead to ultra-low lattice thermal conductivities in the range of 0.75-0.42 Wm-1 K-1 from 300-500 K and make these materials promising candidates for thermoelectric applications. All three structures exhibit very narrow indirect band gaps of less than 0.5 eV as confirmed by DRS measurements. Charge transport properties are consistent with n-type semiconducting behavior with moderate electrical conductivities and large Seebeck coefficients. Low temperature electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements are also performed on II. A promising figure of merit zT of 0.09 for I and II 0.11 for III can be achieved at 475 K.

    "abstract": "This chapter discusses bedbugs which are widely recognized and detested insects. Bedbugs are small- to -sized 4-12 mm ovate and dorsoventrally flattened. Adults are micropterous and their wings are represented by nonfunctional wing pads. Like other Heteroptera Cimicidae have sucking mouthparts metathoracic scent glands in the adults and abdominal scent glands in the immatures. The mouthparts comprise labium and maxillary and mandibular stylets with the latter two forming the salivary and food canals. Bedbugs have several specialized features in common with some closely related groups such as loss of ocelli a sickle-shaped left paramere of the male and a paragenital system of the female. Bedbugs belong to one of the three lineages within Heteroptera that have evolved obligate blood feeding or hematophagy. Similar to other obligate blood-feeding insects cimicids have microbial symbionts occurring in specialized organs that are in all probability important for supplementing the blood diet. The long and disturbing shared history of humans and bedbugs are reflected in language and legend. Human sensitivity to the bite of a bedbug ranges from insensitive to severe immune reactions and depends in part on the level of past exposure. Many people will develop a hypersensitivity following repeated feeding by bedbugs. 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Several sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ELISAs were developed for the benzoylphenylurea insect growth regulators diflubenzuron BAY SIR 8514 and penfluron. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays have been investigated by using several different benzoylphenylurea derivatives as the immunogens as well as coating antigens. The following approach was used to solve the problem of bridge recognition a homologous site systems to use the same coupling site on the benzoylphenylurea molecule in the immunogen and coating antigen but to vary the bridge structure and b heterologous site systems coupling the immunogen and coating antigen from different positions on the benzoylphenylurea molecule. The heterologous systems yielded more sensitive assays but antisera obtained from all the immunogens were used successfully in developing ELISAs for benzoylphenylureas. With these sensitive ELISAs diflubenzuron was detected in milk at a level of 2 ppb without any sample extraction procedure and sample cleanup led to still more sensitive assays. The reproducibility and sensitivity of the method are adequate for practical residue analysis. This work illustrates that a limited collection of antisera and coating antigens can yield a powerful library of assays capable of specifically detecting single compounds or a variety of members of a compound class. 1984 American Chemical Society.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Trauma is the leading cause of death in children and most deaths occur within 24 hours of injury. A better understanding of the causes of death in the immediate period of hospital care is needed. METHODS Trauma admissions younger than 18 years from 2009 to 2019 at a Level I pediatric trauma center were reviewed for deaths n 7145. Patients were stratified into ages 0-6 7-12 and 13-17 years old. The primary outcome was cause of death with early death defined as less than 24 hours after trauma center arrival. RESULTS There were 134 2 deaths with a median age of 7 years. The median time from arrival to death was 14.4 hours interquartile range 0.5-87.8 hours. Half 54 occurred within 24 hours. However most patients who survived initial resuscitation in the emergency department died longer than 24 hours after arrival 69. Traumatic brain injury was the most common cause of death 66 followed by anoxia 9.7 and hemorrhage 8. Deaths from hemorrhage were most often in patients sustaining gunshot wounds 73 vs. 11 of all other deaths p 0.0001 more likely to occur early 100 vs. 50 of all other deaths p 0.0009 and all died within 6 hours of arrival. Death from hemorrhage was more common in adolescents 21.4 of children aged 13-17 vs. 6.3 of children aged 0-6 and 0 of children aged 7-12 p 0.03. The highest case fatality rates were seen in hangings 38.5 and gunshot wounds 9.6. CONCLUSION Half of pediatric trauma deaths occurred within 24 hours. Death from hemorrhage was rare but all occurred within 6 hours of arrival. This is a critical time for interventions for bleeding control to prevent death from hemorrhage in children. Analysis of these deaths can focus efforts on the urgent need for development of new hemorrhage control adjuncts in children. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Epidemiological study level IV.",

RESULTS Macular thickness measurements for all nine ETDRS zones were higher with RTVue compared with Stratus OCT P .01. Linear regression analysis showed the highest correlation in the central macula R2 0.88 with progressively lower correlation peripherally. The overall segmentation error rate was 29 with Stratus OCT versus 32 with RTVue P .05.

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy. Two recently FDA-approved immunotherapies for B-cell malignancies target CD19 in the form of a Bispecific T-Cell Engager BiTE antibody construct or chimeric antigen receptor T CAR-T cells. Blinatumomab an FDA-approved BiTE binds to CD19 on B cells and to CD3 on T cells mediating effector-target cell contact and T-cell activation that results in effective elimination of target B cells. Although CD19 is expressed by essentially all B-cell malignancies at clinical presentation relapses with loss or reduction in CD19 surface expression are increasingly recognized as a cause of treatment failure. Therefore there is a clear need to develop therapeutics for alternate targets. We have developed a novel BiTE consisting of humanized anti-CD22 and anti-CD3 single chain variable fragments. Target binding of the anti-CD22 and anti-CD3 moieties was confirmed by flow cytometry. CD22-BiTE promoted in vitro cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a dose and effector target ET-dependent fashion. Additionally in an established acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL xenograft mouse model CD22-BiTE demonstrated tumor growth inhibition comparable to blinatumomab. Further the combination of blinatumomab and CD22-BiTE yielded increased efficacy in vivo when compared to the single agents. In conclusion we report here the development of a new BiTE with cytotoxic activity against CD22 cells which could represent an alternate or complementary therapeutic option for B-cell malignancies.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To describe recruitment enrollment and participation in a study of US radiologists invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial of two continuing medical education CME interventions designed to improve interpretation of screening mammography. METHODS We collected recruitment consent and intervention-completion information as part of a large study involving radiologists in California Oregon Washington New Mexico New Hampshire North Carolina and Vermont. Consenting radiologists were randomized to receive either a 1-day live expert-led educational session to receive a self-paced DVD with similar content or to a control group delayed intervention. The impact of the interventions was assessed using a preintervention-postintervention test set design. All activities were institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant. RESULTS Of 403 eligible radiologists 151 of 403 37.5 consented to participate in the trial and 119 of 151 78.8 completed the preintervention test set leaving 119 available for randomization to one of the two intervention groups or to controls. Female radiologists were more likely than male radiologists to consent to and complete the study P .03. Consenting radiologists who completed all study activities were more likely to have been interpreting mammography for 10 years or less compared to radiologists who consented and did not complete all study activities or did not consent at all. The live intervention group was more likely to report their intent to change their clinical practice as a result of the intervention compared to those who received the DVD 50 versus 17.6 P .02. The majority of participants in both interventions groups felt the interventions were a useful way to receive CME mammography credits. CONCLUSIONS Community radiologists found interactive interventions designed to improve interpretative mammography performance acceptable and useful for clinical practice. This suggests CME credits for radiologists should in part be for examining practice skills.",

    "abstract": "Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma ALCL similar to systemic ALCL has as its histomorphologic hallmarks cohesive sheets of large lymphoid cells expressing CD30. Several morphologic variants of systemic ALCL have been reported including the common classic type lymphohistiocytic and small cell variants. The small cell variant of ALCL is characterized by a predominant cytomorphology which is unexpected for ALCL being in the context of a small- to medium-sized hyperchromatic atypical lymphocyte. Although well recognized in its systemic form including cases with secondary cutaneous involvement it is less well characterized as a form of primary cutaneous ALCL. In this study we collected 8 cases of primary cutaneous small cell variant of ALCL and examined their clinical histologic and phenotypic features. All patients were middle aged to older adult men the youngest patient was a 46-year-old man with underlying hepatitis C. In one case there was a history of lymphomatoid papulosis. In all patients the disease was in the context of a local regional presentation. Patients were treated with complete excision andor radiation except in one in whom chemotherapy was administered. In all but one patient the cutaneous presentation was a regionally confined process however in 2 cases recurrent disease occurred and in 25 of cases extracutaneous dissemination specifically to regional lymph nodes was observed. Although there was nodal involvement there was no dissemination to bone marrow or peripheral blood no patient has died because of disseminated lymphoma. In all cases there was a predominance of small atypical hyperchromatic cells with a variable background of larger hallmark cells typical of ALCL. Epidermotropism was seen in half of the cases and in one case there was striking pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. The smaller cells demonstrated CD30 positivity and the neoplastic cells showed a CD4-positive phenotype with a variable expression of cytotoxic proteins in about half of the cases whereas in the remaining cases a double negative phenotype was observed. Epithelial membrane antigen expression was observed in the cases tested. In our literature review similar demographics were observed with a comparable percent of cases with extracutaneous dissemination one case manifested an aggressive clinical course eventuating in death. In summation the small cell variant of primary cutaneous ALCL exhibits distinctive features clinically and histologically. While exhibiting an overall higher incidence of extracutaneous dissemination the prognosis fairs better compared with other forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma associated with extracutaneous dissemination an event that defines a harbinger of aggressive disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Over 40 of male and 16 of female carriers of a premutation FMR1 allele 55-200 CGG repeats will develop fragile X-associated tremorataxia syndrome an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder while about 20 of female carriers will develop fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency. Marked elevation in FMR1 mRNA transcript levels has been observed with premutation alleles and RNA toxicity due to increased mRNA levels is the leading molecular mechanism proposed for these disorders. However although the FMR1 gene undergoes alternative splicing it is unknown whether all or only some of the isoforms are overexpressed in premutation carriers and which isoforms may contribute to the premutation pathology. METHODS To address this question we have applied a long-read sequencing approach using single-molecule real-time SMRT sequencing and qRT-PCR. RESULTS Our SMRT sequencing analysis performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells fibroblasts and brain tissue samples derived from premutation carriers and controls revealed the existence of 16 isoforms of 24 predicted variants. Although the relative abundance of all mRNA isoforms was significantly increased in the premutation group as expected based on the bulk increase in mRNA levels there was a disproportionate fourfold to sixfold increase relative to the overall increase in mRNA in the abundance of isoforms spliced at both exons 12 and 14 specifically Iso10 and Iso10b containing the complete exon 15 and differing only in splicing in exon 17. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that RNA toxicity may arise from a relative increase of all FMR1 mRNA isoforms. Interestingly the Iso10 and Iso10b mRNA isoforms lacking the C-terminal functional sites for fragile X mental retardation protein function are the most increased in premutation carriers relative to normal suggesting a functional relevance in the pathology of FMR1-associated disorders.",

    "abstract": "Travel-based multitasking or the performance of activities while traveling is more feasible than ever before as the expanding availability of shared ride services and increasing vehicle automation coincide with the ubiquity of portable information and communication technology devices. However the question of whether and if so how these increasingly blurred boundaries between activities are truly helping rather than hurting us is not presently well-understood. Using an attitudinally-rich travel survey of Northern California commuters N 2500 we develop a conceptual and empirically-based framework for studying benefits and disadvantages of travel-based multitasking. Through latent variable models of reported benefits and disadvantages of activities conducted on a recent commute we identify constructs associated with hedonic and productive benefits and with affective and cognitive disadvantages. This empirically-developed framework informs the definition of binary variables indicating the presenceabsence of each construct for a given traveler on the commute in question. We then present two bivariate binary probit models that examine the effects of person and trip attributes such as personality traits chosen mode commute preferences and activities conducted while traveling on the presence of those benefits and disadvantages respectively. Notably we find evidence that conditionsactivities that may facilitate multitasking benefits can also simultaneously yield disadvantages for example several activities conspicuously including talking on or otherwise using a phone increase the probability of receiving benefits while also increasing the probability of experiencing cognitive disadvantages. This finding resonates with the general multitasking literature and empirically corroborates the suggestion that travel-based multitasking may not uniformly increase trip utility.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Social support social strain and stressful life events could induce chronic stress which affects prognosis and survival after breast cancer diagnosis. However few studies have examined the impact of psychosocial factors on different competing mortality events. METHODS We included 9154 postmenopausal women who were newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer after enrollment in the Womens Health Initiative as of March 6th 2021. Psychosocial factors were collected and stratified into quartiles. Cause of death was verified through adjudicated medical record reviews. Associations between psychosocial factors and all-cause mortality breast cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality were examined by competing risk models. Subsequent stratified analyses were performed by race. RESULTS With a median follow-up time of 8.6 years 3218 deaths were identified. Compared to participants with less social support those who had higher social support had significantly lower all-cause mortality Q4 vs. Q1 HR 0.89 95 CI 0.81 0.9. The highest quartile of social strain was associated with lower CVD mortality Q4 vs. Q1 HR 0.80 95 CI 0.65 0.99. After stratification a similar relationship was found in White women but not in Black women. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that there was an association between high social support and reduced all-cause mortality regardless of cancer stages at diagnosis. Social support interventions after breast cancer diagnosis could have the potential to reduce overall mortality.",

Results There were 10 responses to the survey 83 response rate. All respondents considered recent ipsilateral COVID-19 vaccination relevant to the interpretation of UAL. Seven respondents 70 alsonbsp considered non-COVID-19 vaccinations relevant. All respondents documented recent COVID-19 vaccinations but 4 40 had no information for other vaccines. Eight respondents 80 delayed screening after COVID-19 vaccination during initial vaccination efforts and 3 30 still required or suggested delaying screening at the time of the survey. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System BI-RADS categorization for UAL with no abnormal findings in the ipsilateral breast varied by facility and modality. BI-RADS categorization for UAL previously assigned to BI-RADS 0 or associated with suspicious ipsilateral breast findings varied but practices tended to demonstrate a high level of suspicion unless the UAL showed improvement on follow-up imaging. For unchanged UAL on initial follow-up 7 70 assign BI-RADS 3 and 3 30 assign BI-RADS 4.Conclusion Despite available guidelines there was no consensus approach to managing UAL after vaccination among academic and community-based breast imaging radiologists in California. Management was more uniform for a subset of patients perceived to be at higher risk for lymph node metastases with most or all respondents recommending biopsy when there was nbspa suspicious finding in the ipsilateral breast concurrent ipsilateral breast cancer or concurrent malignant tumors not in the breast known to metastasize to the axilla.",

    "abstract": "Three brands of commercial roast beef were purchased and artificially inoculated with a 5-strain Listeria monocytogenes cocktail at 2 inoculation levels approximately 3 and 6 Log CFUg. Although all 3 brands contained sodium diacetate and sodium lactate inoculated Listeria cocktail survived for 16 d in all 3 brands significant increases in L. monocytogenes numbers were seen on inoculated Brand B roast beef on days 12 and 16. Numbers of L. monocytogenes increased to 4.14 Log CFUg for the 3 Log CFUg inoculation level and increased to 7.99 Log CFUg for the 6 Log CFUg inoculation level by day 16 with the pH values being 5.4 and 5.8 respectively. To measure the cell viability in potential biofilms formed an Alamar blue assay was conducted. Brand B meat homogenate had the highest metabolic activities P 0.05. By comparing its metabolic activities to Brands A and C and the inoculated autoclaved meat homogenates results indicated that the microflora present in Brand B may be the reason for high metabolic activities. Based on the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index analysis the Brand factor significantly impacted the diversity index P 0.012 and Brand B had the highest microflora diversity Shannon index 1.636 0.011. Based on this study results showed that antimicrobials cannot completely inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat roast beef. Native microflora both diversity and abundance together with product formula pH antimicrobial concentrations and storage conditions may all impact the survival and growth of L. monocytogenes.",

METHODS Data from routine clinic visits at multiple centres were collected in a systematic manner. Data included all domains identified as important in randomised controlled trials in PsA. Decisions to change treatment were used as surrogates for high disease activity. New indices were developed by multiple linear regression psoriatic arthritis disease activity score PASDAS and empirically utilising physician-defined cut-offs for disease activity arithmetic mean of desirability functions AMDF. These were compared with existing composite measures Composite Psoriatic arthritis Disease Activity Index CPDAI Disease Activity for PSoriatic Arthritis DAPSA and Disease Activity Score for rheumatoid arthritis DAS28. RESULTS 161503 32 subjects had treatment changes. Although all measures performed well compared with existing indices PASDAS was better able to discriminate between high and low disease activity area under receiver operating curves ROC curve with 95 CI PASDAS 0.773 0.723 0.822 AMDF 0.730 0.680 0.780 CPDAI 0.719 0.668 0.770 DAPSA 0.710 0.654 0.766 DAS28 0.736 0.680 0.792. All measures were able to discriminate between disease activity states in patients with oligoarthritis although area under the receiver operating curves AUC were generally smaller. In patients with severe skin disease psoriasis area and severity index10 both nonparametric and AUC curve statistics were nonsignificant for all measures. CONCLUSIONS Two new composite measures to assess disease activity in PsA have been developed. Further testing in other datasets including comparison with existing measures is required to validate these instruments.",

SETTING Four hundred fifty-bed adult and 150-bed childrens tertiary referral teaching hospital. CASE SUMMARY Massive rainfall from tropical storm Allison caused extensive flooding. Emergency power came on at 140 AM. Complete power loss occurred at 330 AM. The decision to begin evacuation of patients was made at approximately 1030 AM. All 575 patients were either discharged from the hospital 169 patients or evacuated 406 patients to 29 other facilities by both ambulance and helicopter by 3 PM the next day. Six deaths occurred none of which could be attributed to the conditions created by the flooding. CONCLUSIONS The lessons learned from this experience included the following 1 flooding will occur in a flood plain 2 electrical power outages are not necessarily temporary-begin evacuation 3 appoint a triage officer from those available 4 have a reliable in-house communication system not dependent on telephone lines or electricity 5 have a reliable telephone system for contacting outside facilities 6 have flashlights available on all units 7 have battery-operated exit signs and stairway lights 8 maximize use of volunteers when they are available and fresh 9 maintain a paper record of all patient transfers 10 coordinate loading of ambulances and helicopters for patient transfer and 11 reassign staff as necessary to care for transferred patients. Emergent evacuation of a large tertiary hospital requires extensive effort from both the hospital staff and the community.",

    "abstract": "The McLafferty rearrangement is an extensively studied fragmentation reaction for the odd-electron positive ions from a diverse range of functional groups and molecules. Here we present experimental and theoretical results of 12 model compounds that were synthesized and investigated by GC-TOF MS and density functional theory calculations. These compounds consisted of three main groups carbonyls oximes and silyl oxime ethers. In all electron ionization mass spectra the fragment ions that could be attributed to the occurrence of a McLafferty rearrangement were observed. For t-butyldimethylsilyl oxime ethers with oxygen in a -position the McLafferty rearrangement was accompanied by loss of the t-butyl radical. The various mass spectra showed that the McLafferty rearrangement is relatively enhanced compared with other primary fragmentation reactions by the following factors oxime versus carbonyl oxygen versus methylene at the -position and ketone versus aldehyde. Calculations predict that the stepwise mechanism is favored over the concerted mechanism for all but one compound. For carbonyl compounds C-C bond breaking was the rate-determining step. However for both the oximes and t-butyldimethylsilyl oxime ethers with oxygen at the -position the hydrogen transfer step was rate limiting whereas with a CH2 group at the -position the C-C bond breaking was again rate determining. n-Propoxy-acetaldehyde bearing an oxygen atom at the -position is the only case that was predicted to proceed through a concerted mechanism. The synthesized oximes exist as both the E- and Z-isomers and these were separable by GC. In the mass spectra of the two isomers fragment ions that were generated by the McLafferty rearrangement were observed. Finally fragment ions corresponding to the McLafferty reverse charge rearrangement were observed for all compounds at varying relative ion intensities compared with the conventional McLafferty rearrangement.",

    "abstract": "We study a novel geometric expansion for scattering amplitudes in the planar sector of N 4 super Yang-Mills theory in the context of the Amplituhedron which reproduces the all-loop integrand as a canonical differential form on the positive geometry. In a paper by Arkani-Hamed Henn and one of the authors it was shown that this result can be recast in terms of negative geometries with a certain hierarchy of loops closed cycles in the space of loop momenta represented by lines in momentum twistor space. One can then calculate an all-loop order result in the approximation where only tree graphs in the space of all loops are considered. Furthermore using differential equation methods it is possible to calculate and resum integrated expressions and obtain strong coupling results. In this paper we provide a more general framework for the loops of loops expansion and outline a powerful method for the determination of differential forms for higher-order geometries. We solve the problem completely for graphs with one internal cycle but the method can be used more generally for other geometries.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To localize and identify the gene and mutations causing autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy in two consanguineous Pakistani families. METHODS Consanguineous families from Pakistan were ascertained to be affected with autosomal recessive retinal degeneration. All affected individuals underwent thorough ophthalmologic examinations. Blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out procedure. Genotyping was performed using microsatellite markers spaced at approximately 10 cM intervals. Two-point linkage analysis was performed with the lod score method. Direct DNA sequencing of amplified genomic DNA was performed for mutation screening of candidate genes. RESULTS Genome-wide linkage scans yielded a lod score of 3.05 at 0 for D17S1832 and 3.82 at 0 for D17S938 localizing the disease gene to a 12.22 cM 6.64 Mb region flanked by D17S1828 and D17S1852 for family 61032 and family 61227 which contains aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein-like 1 AIPL1 a gene previously implicated in recessive Leber congenital amaurosis and autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy. Sequencing of AIPL1 showed a homozygous c.773GC p.Arg258Pro sequence change in all affected individuals of family 61032 and a homozygous c.465GT p.H93_Q155del change in all affected members of family 61227. CONCLUSIONS The results strongly suggest that the c.773GC p.R258P and c.465GT p.H93_Q155del mutations in AIPL1 cause autosomal recessive retinal degeneration in these consanguineous Pakistani families.",

The same is not true for more realistic materials since more general grain boundary energies in principle allow many more viable grain boundary configurations. A grain growth simulation for such a material therefore requires a procedure to enumerate all possible topological transitions and select the most energetically favorable one. Such a procedure is developed and implemented here for a microstructure represented by a volumetric finite element mesh. As a specific example all possible transitions for a typical configuration with five grains around a junction point are enumerated and some exceptional transitions are found to be energetically similar to the conventional ones even for a uniform boundary energy. A general discrete formulation to calculate grain boundary velocities is used to simulate grain growth for an example microstructure. The method is implemented as a C library based on SCOREC an open source massively parallelizable library for finite element simulations with adaptive meshing.",

Processing of caneberry fruit typically removes the seed and the development of a value-added use of seeds could expand the market for caneberries and the profit margins for growers. An initial step toward the use of the seeds is a characterization of seed and oil. Our investigation has described compositional characteristics for seeds of five commonly grown caneberry species red raspberry black raspberry boysenberry Marion blackberry and evergreen blackberry. Seeds from all five species had 6-7 protein and 11-18 oil. The oils contained 53-63 linoleic acid 15-31 linolenic acid and 3-8 saturated fatty acids. The two smaller seeded raspberry species had higher percentages of oil the lowest amounts of saturated fatty acid and the highest amounts of linolenic acid. Antioxidant capacities were detected both for whole seeds and for cold-pressed oils but did not correlate to total phenolics or tocopherols. Ellagitannins and free ellagic acid were the main phenolics detected in all five caneberry species and were approximately 3-fold more abundant in the blackberries and the boysenberry than in the raspberries.",

    "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE The main objective of the current investigation was to assess the readability of Internet-based patient education materials related to the field of anesthesiology. We hypothesized that the majority of patient education materials would not be written according to current recommended readability grade level. SETTING Online patient education materials describing procedures risks and management of anesthesia-related topics were identified using the search engine Google available at www.google.com using the terms anesthesia anesthesiology anesthesia risks and anesthesia care. DESIGN Cross-sectional evaluation. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS Assessments of content readability were performed using validated instruments Flesch-Kincaid Grade Formulae the Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook the New Dale-Chall Test the Fry graph and the Flesch Reading Ease score. MAIN RESULTS Ninety-six Web sites containing Internet patient education materials IPEMs were evaluated. The median interquartile range readability grade level for all evaluated IPEMs was 13.5 12.0-14.6. All the evaluated documents were classified at a greater readability level than the current recommended readability grade P .001. Readability grades were not significantly different among different IPEM sources. Assessment by the Flesch Reading Ease test classified all but 4 IPEMs as at least fairly difficult to read. CONCLUSIONS Internet-based patient education materials related to the field of anesthesiology are currently written far above the recommended readability grade level. High complexity of written education materials likely limits access of information to millions of American patients. Redesign of online content of Web sites that provide patient education material regarding anesthesia could be an important step in improving access to information for patients with poor health literacy.",

    "abstract": "The posttranslational sulfation of tyrosine has been thought to be initiated by the recognition of specific consensus features by the sulfating enzyme tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase TPST. However using these recognition features to identify new tyrosine sulfation sites misses recently characterized sites that lack these features. Rigorous analysis of the amino acids surrounding the target tyrosine using the position-specific scoring matrix PSSM demonstrates that a consensus sequence does not contain all the information necessary to predict tyrosine sulfation. Instead accurate prediction requires consideration of all residues within five amino acids on either side of the target tyrosine. These results support the notion that secondary structure is the major determinant of sulfation and that other residues within the sulfation site can compensate for deviations from commonly observed features. This view implies that specific consensus features are not critical for TPST substrate recognition but that TPST may instead broadly recognize any sufficiently exposed tyrosine residue.",

ADLs differ from typical actions in that they can involve long-scale temporal structure making tea can take a few minutes and complex object interactions a fridge looks different when its door is open. We develop novel representations including 1 temporal pyramids which generalize the well-known spatial pyramid to approximate temporal correspondence when scoring a model and 2 composite object models that exploit the fact that objects look different when being interacted with. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation and demonstrate that our novel representations produce a two-fold improvement over traditional approaches.

    "abstract": "An obstacle to testing human impacts on flooding is that anthropogenic and natural hydrologic changes occur simultaneously and are often indistinguishable. We attempted to isolate the impacts of overlapping mechanisms on flooding by analyzing 73-188 years of stage measurements from the Mississippi River system and the German Rhine. Although typically under-utilized in hydrologic analysis stage data document the cumulative impacts of both upstream changes such and climate and land use as well as modifications of the river channel and floodplain. Analysis of trends in peak stages and flood frequencies shows contrasting results on the Mississippi and Rhine increasing trends at most Mississippi stations but no significant trends at most Rhine stations. On the Mississippi and its tributaries statistically significant changes in peak stages and peak-stage frequencies were identified at 10 of 14 stations with all but one exhibiting increased flooding. On the Rhine River systematic change occurred at only 1 of 8 stations analyzed. On both river systems channel and floodplain modifications dominated net hydrologic response overwhelming the effects of climate change land-use shifts and dam construction. Specific-gage analysis which isolates the impacts of instream river modifications documented declining flow conveyance at all stations where flood levels and frequencies increased. Increased flooding at the Mississippi River sites appears to be driven by the history of aggressive channel engineering in particular channel constriction to increase navigation depths. In contrast navigation infrastructure on the Rhine has not substantially degraded the rivers capacity to efficiently convey flood flows. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We investigate disease-free survival and secondarily prolonged pain and chondronecrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review of 52 patients undergoing transoral laser microsurgery after previous radiation. RESULTS Mean disease-free survival was 36.7 months. Overall disease-free survival was 57.6 at 3-year and 48.4 at 5-year follow-up with no significant difference between surgery within as opposed to after 60 months of radiation or within as opposed to after 12 months of radiation. Thirteen patients all with surgery within 60 months of radiation experienced prolonged pain. Twelve experienced chondronecrosis all within 12 months of surgery. CONCLUSION Transoral laser microsurgery for early laryngeal cancer is an adequate therapeutic option in patients with history of radiation with comparable disease-free survival to other reports. Patients undergoing transoral laser microsurgery within 60 months of radiation treatment are more likely to experience prolonged pain.",

    "abstract": "Climate warming is expected to change the distribution and abundance of many species. Range shifts have been detected in a number of European taxa for which long-term government-initiated or organized-survey data are available. In North America well-organized long-term data needed to document such shifts are much less common. Opportunistic observations made by citizen scientist groups may be an excellent alternative to systematic surveys. From 1992 to 2010 19779 butterfly surveys were made by amateur naturalists in Massachusetts a geographically small state located at the convergence of northern and southern bioclimatic zones in eastern North America. From these data we estimated population trends for nearly all butterfly species 100 of 116 species present using list-length analysis. Population trajectories indicate increases of many species near their northern range limits and declines in nearly all species 17 of 21 near their southern range limits. Certain life-history traits especially overwintering stage were strongly associated with declines. Our results suggest that a major climate-induced shift of North American butterflies characterized by northward expansions of warm-adapted and retreat of cold-adapted species is underway. 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship of adherence and pregnancy in participants using an estetrol and drospirenone combined oral contraceptive. METHODS We performed a secondary analysis for which we pooled data from two parallel multicenter phase 3 trials United States and Canada Europe and Russia that enrolled participants 16-50 years of age to receive estetrol 15 mg and drospirenone 3 mg in a 24 hormone and four placebo pills regimen for up to 13 cycles. Participants reported pill intake sexual intercourse and other contraceptive use on paper diaries. We limited this efficacy analysis to at-risk cycles one or more reported acts of intercourse and no other contraceptive use in participants 16-35 years of age at screening. We excluded cycles with other contraceptive use unless pregnancy occurred in that cycle. We assessed primarily the relationship between number of pills not taken per cycle and pregnancies and secondarily when pregnancies occurred during product use with a test for trend and 2 analyses as appropriate. RESULTS Among 2837 participants in this analysis 31 on-treatment pregnancies occurred during 26455 at-risk cycles. Pregnancies occurred in 0.09 0.25 0.83 and 1.6 of cycles in which participants reported they took all hormone pills n25613 cycles or did not take one n405 cycles two n121 cycles and more than two n314 cycles hormone-containing pills respectively P .001. No pregnancies occurred in 2216 cycles when one or more pills were missed and missed-pill instructions were followed. All pregnancies related to not taking pills occurred in the first three cycles. Pregnancy rates ranged from 0 to 0.21 per cycle with no significant trend by cycle P .45. CONCLUSION Pregnancy occurs more frequently when combined oral contraceptive users report not taking all hormone-containing pills per 28-day cycle and exceeds 1 only when more than two pills are not taken. Pregnancies in participants who reported missed pills occurred only when missed-pill instructions were not followed. A 0.09 pregnancy risk per cycle among users of a 24 hormone and four placebo pills formulation who report taking all pills likely approximates a true method-failure rate.

    "abstract": "Species with different ecological niches will likely exhibit distinct responses to a changing environment. Differences in the magnitude of niche specialization may also indicate which species may be more vulnerable to environmental change as many life-history characteristics are known to affect climate change vulnerability. We characterized the niche space of three sympatric high-elevation ground-dwelling squirrels yellow-bellied marmot Marmota flaviventer Beldings ground squirrel Urocitellus beldingi and golden-mantled ground squirrel Callospermophilus lateralis in the alpine and upper subalpine regions of the Sierra Nevada in California. We used 5879 observations of individual squirrels collected from 4 years 2009-2012 of transect survey data to quantify which ecogeographical variable types climate topography or landcover were most important in defining the niche of each species. We conducted Ecological Niche Factor Analysis to quantify the niche and generate indices of marginality magnitude of selection and specialization narrowness of niche space. All three species demonstrated differential use of niche space when compared to the available niche space. Moreover the relative importance of the variables shaping the niche differed among these species. For example the presence of meadows was important in defining the niche for U. beldingi and M. flaviventer but the presence of conifers was important to C. lateralis. Precipitation was important in defining the niche for all three species positively so for U. beldingi and negatively for the other two species. The niche breadth of these three species was also positively associated with geographic range size. Mammals in high-elevation mountain systems often are perceived as vulnerable to climate shifts but our results underscore the importance of also including non-climate-based factors in defining the niche. The overall magnitude of niche selection for all three species was driven by a combination of topographic climatic and landcover factors thus efforts to forecast areas where these species can persist in the future need to evaluate from more than just a climatic perspective.",

    "abstract": "Oceanic and coastal waters are acidifying due to processes dominated in the open ocean by increasing atmospheric CO2 and dominated in estuaries and some coastal waters by nutrient-fueled respiration. The patterns and severity of acidification as well as its effects are modified by the host of stressors related to human activities that also influence these habitats. Temperature deoxygenation and changes in food webs are particularly important co-stressors because they are pervasive and both their causes and effects are often mechanistically linked to acidification. Development of a theoretical underpinning to multiple stressor research that considers physiological ecological and evolutionary perspectives is needed because testing all combinations of stressors and stressor intensities experimentally is impossible. Nevertheless use of a wide variety of research approaches is a logical and promising strategy for improving understanding of acidification and its effects. Future research that focuses on spatial and temporal patterns of stressor interactions and on identifying mechanisms by which multiple stressors affect individuals populations and ecosystems is critical. It is also necessary to incorporate consideration of multiple stressors into management mitigation and adaptation to acidification and to increase public and policy recognition of the importance of addressing acidification in the context of the suite of other stressors with which it potentially interacts.",

This fraction is much higher than in most developed countries. That results the Japanese building construction industry including residential use consumes about one third of all energy and resources of the entire industrial sectors. In order to save energy as well as resource the recycle of the building materials should be urgent to be carried out. In this paper we focus on the potential energy savings with a simple calculated method when the building materials or products are manufactured from recycled materials. We examined three kinds of residential buildings with different construction techniques and estimated the decreased amount of energy consumption and resources resulting from use of recycled materials. The results have shown for most building materials the energy consumption needed to remake housing materials from recycled materials is lower than that to make new housing materials. The energy consumption of building materials in all case-study housing can be saved by at least 10. At the same time the resource measured by mass of building materials kg can be decreased by over 50. 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",

A random sample of 2967 horses was selected from the equine population in New York State using the 1988 New York State Equine Census as a sampling frame. The samples were tested for the presence of antibodies against seven serovars L. pomona L. hardjo L. icterohaemorrhagiae L. grippotyphosa L. canicola L. autumnalis and L. bratislava. The microscopic agglutination test was used to determine seropositivity at a range of dilutions from 1100 to 112800. A tiler of 100 was considered positive. We also examined the association between seroconversion at higher 1600 liters among those serovars. Cluster analysis was used to examine the distribution of the disease for special pattern or clustering. The following prevalences were determined L. pomona 7.6 L. hardjo 1.0 L. icterohaemorrhagiae 11.3 L. grippotyphosa 6.5 L. canicola 16.2 L. autumnalis 35.1 and L. bratislava 40.7. The majority of the titers for all serovars were relatively low. Most of the samples tested positive for L. pomona had titers ranging from 100 to 400. For all the other serovars most samples tested positive had titers ranging from 100 to 200.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The second largest Ebola virus disease EVD outbreak began in the Democratic Republic of Congo in July 2018 in North Kivu Province. Data suggest the outbreak is not epidemiologically linked to the 2018 outbreak in Equateur Province and that independent introduction of Ebola virus EBOV into humans occurred. We tested for antibodies to ebolaviruses in febrile patients seeking care in North Kivu Province prior to the EVD outbreak. METHODS Patients were enrolled between May 2017 and April 2018 before the declared start of the outbreak in eastern DRC. Questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and behavioural information to identify risk factors for exposure. Biological samples were evaluated for ebolavirus nucleic acid and for antibodies to ebolaviruses. Prevalence of exposure was calculated and demographic factors evaluated for associations with ebolavirus serostatus. RESULTS Samples were collected and tested from 272 people seeking care in the Rutshuru Health Zone in North Kivu Province. All patients were negative for filoviruses by PCR. Intial screening by indirect ELISA found that 30 people were reactive to EBOV-rGP. Results were supported by detection of ebolavirus reactive linear peptides using the Serochip platform. Differential screening of all reactive serum samples against the rGP of all six ebolaviruses and Marburg virus MARV showed that 29 people exhibited the strongest reactivity to EBOV and one to Bombali virus BOMV and western blotting confirmed results. Titers ranged from 1100 to 112800. Although both sexes and all ages tested positive for antibodies women were significantly more likely to be positive and the majority of positives were in February 2018. CONCLUSIONS We provide the first documented evidence of exposure to Ebola virus in people in eastern DRC. We detected antibodies to EBOV in 10 of febrile patients seeking healthcare prior to the declaration of the 2018-2020 outbreak suggesting early cases may have been missed or exposure ocurred without associated illness. We also report the first known detection of antibodies to BOMV previously detected in bats in West and East Africa and show that human exposure to BOMV has occurred. Our data suggest human exposure to ebolaviruses may be more frequent and geographically widespread.",

A number of interesting regularities emerge. When a countrys costs rise the share of U.S. overseas assembly activities in that location decline. Conversely a countrys share grows when competitor country costs increase. While own and competitor country costs affect overseas assembly in all countries the magnitude of these effects is larger for developing countries. In many cases the measured cost responses appear to correspond with outsourcing theories that are based on search and customization costs. 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We have now extended the study to heteromultimeric channels consisting of various numbers of mutant subunits as well as channels without mutant subunits all in the background of a chimeric Shaker channel having increased conductance. It has been found that activation-coupled sublevels exist in all these channel types and are traversed in at least 80 of all deactivation time courses. In symmetric K solutions the currents in the two sublevels have a linear voltage dependence being 23-44 and 54-70 of the fully open conductance. Sublevels in different channel types share similar voltage dependence of the mean lifetime and similar ion selectivity properties. However the mean lifetime of each current level depends approximately geometrically on the number of mutant subunits in the channel becoming shorter in channels having fewer mutant subunits. Each mutant subunit appears to stabilize all of the conducting states by approximately 0.5 kcalmol. Consistent with previous results in the mutant channel sublevels in channels with two or no mutant subunits also showed ion selectivities that differ from that of the fully open level having relatively higher K than Rb conductances. A model is presented in which Shaker channels have two coupled activation gates one associated with the selectivity filter and a second associated with the S6 helix bundle.",

All patients underwent radiosurgery with a 201-source cobalt-60 gamma unit. Twenty-eight patients 82 had previous histological confirmation of a meningioma 1 to 5 cranial base craniotomies per patient 6 18 were treated on the basis of neuroimaging criteria alone. The single-fraction radiation tumor margin dose 10 to 20 Gy was designed to conform to the irregular tumor volumes in all patients. The maximum radiation dose to the optic nerve or tract was reduced to 9 Gy in 31 patients. No patient had tumor growth 100 tumor control during the follow-up interval median 26 mo. Tumor regression was observed in 56 of patients imaged at an average of 18 months. Eight patients 24 improved clinically at follow-up examinations. Four patients developed new or worsened cranial nerve deficits during the follow-up interval two had subsequent full improvement. No patient developed an endocrinopathy or new extraocular muscle paresis. Stereotactic radiosurgery using multiple isocenter dosimetry facilitated by the gamma unit is an accurate safe and effective technique to prevent the growth of tumors involving the cavernous sinus. Despite the proximity of such tumors to adjacent cranial nerves complications were rare. The maximum length of hospital stay was 36 hours and all patients returned to their preoperative employment status within 3 to 5 days.ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of decline have been observed on dying coast live oak Quercus agrifolia trees in areas throughout southern California that are both infested and uninfested by the gold-spotted oak borer GSOB. The purpose of this study was to identify and assess the pathogenicity of several anamorph species of the Botryosphaeriaceae including Diplodia corticola Dothiorella iberica and Diplodia agrifolia sp. nov. that were recovered consistently from symptomatic tissues. Species were identified morphologically and by phylogenetic analyses of the complete sequence of the internal transcribed spacer ITS of the rDNA and partial sequences of -tubulin and elongation factor EF1- genes. Results from morphological assessments and phylogenetic analyses support the erection of a new species closely related to D. mutila described herein as Diplodia agrifolia sp. nov. Pathogenicity of all species was verified by wound inoculation of 1 y old coast live oak seedlings under controlled conditions. Isolates of D. corticola were the most aggressive tested and isolates of D. agrifolia were the second most aggressive. Both species caused bleeding symptoms on inoculated seedlings. Seedlings inoculated with D. corticola died within 4 wk with the pathogen progressing up and down through the xylem in advance of living phloem and moving throughout the taproot in 70 of inoculated seedlings. Colonization and re-isolation was successful for all species. All three fungal species represent newly recorded fungal pathogens of coast live oak in California. Results from the pathogenicity test suggest that these fungi play a role in the decline of coast live oaks throughout southern California.",

There is consensus that effective educational approaches need to be combined with a rewarding work environment emphasize a good worklife balance and a focus on achieving meaningful outcomes that center on patients and the public. Still significant barriers limit the numbers of clinicians interested in pursuing careers in primary care including low earning potential heavy medical school debt lack of respect from physician colleagues and enormous burdens of record keeping. To enlarge and energize the pool of primary care trainees we look especially at changes that focus on institutions and the practice environment. Students and residents need training environments where primary care clinicians and interdisciplinary teams play a crucially important role in patient care. For a variety of reasons many academic medical centers cannot easily meet these standards. The authors propose that a major part of primary care education and training be re-located to settings in high-performing health systems built on comprehensive integrated care models where primary care clinicians play a principle role in leadership and care delivery.",

Retrospective search identified 96 women with breast cancer who had a breast MRI both before and during adjuvant tamoxifen therapy between 2002 and 2008. After exclusion of all irradiated breasts 88 women were eligible. Two readers blinded to tamoxifen treatment status independently rated level of BPE amount of FGT and cysts using a 4-point categorical scale BPE--Minimal Mild Moderate Marked FGT--Fatty Scattered Heterogeneously Dense HD Dense Cysts--Minimal Mild Moderate Marked. A consensus interpretation was reached in cases of disagreement. During tamoxifen there was a significant shift from higher to lower degree BPE cysts and FGT compared with before tamoxifen. BPE cysts and FGT decreased in 68 6088 38 3388 and 40 3588 of women during tamoxifen p0.001 for all measures. After the exclusion of all cases with minimal BPE cysts or FGT on the pre-tamoxifen MRI the percentage of women demonstrating a decrease in these factors increased to 81 6074 77 3343 and 41 3586 respectively. Exclusion of patients treated with chemotherapy did not substantially change these results. The percentage of women with decreases in FGT and cysts increased with greater duration on tamoxifen whereas decreases in BPE were detected early in treatment 90 days and did not change substantially with longer duration on tamoxifen. A significant association exists between treatment with tamoxifen and decreases in BPE cysts and FGT on breast MRI.",

BACKGROUND Previous studies demonstrate substantial disagreement between clinical registry and administrative claims data on the occurrence of postoperative complications. Clinical data have greater validity than claims data for quality measurement but can be burdensome for hospitals to collect. METHODS American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program records were linked to Medicare inpatient claims 2005-2008. National Quality Forum-endorsed risk-adjusted measures of 30-day postoperative complications or death assessed hospital quality for patients undergoing colectomy lower extremity bypass or all surgical procedures. Measures use hierarchical multivariable logistic regression to identify statistical outliers. Measures were applied using clinical data claims data or a hybrid of both data sources. Kappa statistics assessed agreement on determinations of hospital quality. RESULTS A total of 111984 patients participated from 206 hospitals. Agreement on hospital quality between clinical and claims data was poor. Hybrid models using claims data to risk-adjust complications identified by clinical data had moderate agreement with all clinical data models whereas hybrid models using clinical data to risk-adjust complications identified by claims data had routinely poor agreement with all clinical data models. CONCLUSIONS Assessments of hospital quality differ substantially when using clinical registry versus administrative claims data. A hybrid approach using claims data for risk adjustment and clinical data for complications may be a valid alternative with lower data collection burden. For quality measures focused on postoperative complications to be meaningful such policies should require at a minimum collection of clinical outcomes data.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Mongolia is a country characterized by its vast distances and extreme climate. An underdeveloped medical transport infrastructure makes patient transfer from outlying regions dangerous. Providing pediatric surgical care locally is crucial to improve the lives of children in the countryside. This is the first structured assessment of nationwide pediatric surgical capacity. METHODS Operation rates were calculated using data from the Mongolian Center for Health Development and population data from the Mongolian Statistical Information Service. The Pediatric Personnel Infrastructure Procedures Equipment and Supplies PediPIPES survey tool was used to collect data at all survey sites. Descriptive data analyses were completed using Excel. Studies of association were completed using Stata. All reported percentages are of the hospitals outside of the capital n 21. RESULTS All provincial hospitals have general surgeons seven 33.3 of them have pediatric surgeons. One facility has no anesthesiologist. All facilities perform basic procedures and provide anesthesia. Four 19 can treat common congenital anomalies. All facilities have basic operating room equipment. Nine hospitals do not have pulse oximetry available. Twelve hospitals do not have pediatric surgical instruments always available. Pediatric supplies are lacking. CONCLUSIONS Provincial hospitals in Mongolia can perform basic procedures. However essential pediatric supplies are lacking. Consequently certain life-saving procedures are not available to children outside of the capital. Only a few improvements would be amendable to low-cost process improvement adjustment and the majority of needs require resource additions. Procedure equipment and supply availability should be further explored to develop a comprehensive nationwide pediatric surgical program.",

METHODS We reviewed regulations for childcare centers centers and family childcare homes homes in effect May-July 2016 and rated all 50 states for inclusion 1 not included 2 partially included 3 fully included of 12 breastfeeding and beverage best practices. We calculated average ratings for 6 practices specific to infants aged 0-11 months 6 practices specific to children aged 1-6 years and all 12 practices by state and across all states. We assessed significant differences between centers and homes for each best practice by using McNemar-Bowker tests for symmetry and we assessed differences across states by using paired student t tests. RESULTS States included best practices in regulations for centers more often than for homes. Average ratings standard deviations in regulations across all states were significantly higher in centers than in homes for infant best practices 2.1 0.5 vs 1.8 0.5 P .001 child best practices 2.1 0.6 vs 1.8 0.6 P .002 and all 12 best practices combined 2.1 0.5 vs 1.8 0.6 P .001.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Among individuals with hypertension and low diastolic blood pressure DBP the optimal BP target remains controversial due to concerns that BP lowering may reduce coronary perfusion. We determined the impact of intensive BP control among individuals with elevated systolic BP who have low DBP and elevated hs-cTnT high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 8828 participants in SPRINT Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial were stratified by baseline DBP. Those with low DBP 70 mm Hg were further stratified by elevated hs-cTnT 14 ngL at baseline. The effects of intensive versus standard BP lowering on a cardiovascular disease composite end point all-cause death and 1-year change in hs-cTnT were determined. The combination of low DBPhigh hs-cTnT was independently associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and all-cause death as well as greater 1-year increases in hs-cTnT compared with DBP 70 mm Hg. However randomization to intensive versus standard BP lowering led to similar reductions in cardiovascular disease risk among individuals with low DBPhigh hs-cTnT hazard ratio HR 0.82 95 CI 0.57-1.19 low DBPlow hs-cTnT HR 0.48 95 CI 0.29-0.79 and DBP 70 mm Hg HR 0.73 95 CI 0.60-0.89 P for interaction0.20. Intensive BP lowering also led to a reduction in all-cause death that was similar across groups P for interaction0.57. CONCLUSIONS In this nonprespecified subgroup analysis of SPRINT individuals with low DBP and elevated hs-cTnT low DBP and nonelevated hs-cTnT and DBP 70 mm Hg derived similar cardiovascular disease and mortality benefits from intensive BP lowering. These findings warrant confirmation in other studies.",

Other automakers have also announced that they are headed that way. But how far along is this revolution really What challenges still need to be overcome to gain truly widespread acceptance on a scale that can combat climate change Will the costs and the benefits of these new vehicles be equally spread among countries and companies And while we all benefit in the long term who will be the winners and the losers in our short-term world where Wall Street thinking predominates.",

    "abstract": "A method for in vivo analysis of gastric mucin oligosaccharides was developed and applied to rhesus monkeys with and without Helicobacter pylori infection. Mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides were directly released by reductive beta-elimination from gastric biopsies from rhesus monkeys. The released oligosaccharides were structurally characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorptionionozation and electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. A diverse profile of neutral and acidic oligosaccharides was observed with these techniques. The most predominant core structure detected in all of the samples at relatively high abundance corresponded to core 2 2HexNAc-1Hex mz 611.227. The spectra generated from H. pylori-infected monkey samples showed fewer oligosaccharides collectively. Peaks corresponding to 1HexNAc-1Hex mz 408.148 and 2HexNAc mz 449.174 which most likely represent core structures were absent in all infected monkeys studied although present in all uninfected monkeys. Unsupervised cluster analysis demonstrated clear differences between the peaks detected in uninfected and naturally infected monkey samples. The results suggest that H. pylori infection is associated with lower relative abundance of oligosaccharides and loss of mucin-type core structures. This method can be applied to characterize the glycans associated with the mucin lining of live animals and allows for repeated analysis of the same animal over the course of infection.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspIntroduction Among young patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL and acute myeloid leukemia AML minority raceethnicity and lack of health insurance have been associated with lower survival. We sought to evaluate the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic status nSES and neighborhood archetype on early mortality and overall survival among patients with ALL and AML in California. We hypothesized that living in low SES neighborhoods will be associated with lower survival among young patients with acute leukemia. Methods Patients aged 0-39 years reported to the California Cancer Registry with a diagnosis of ALL or AML between 2006 and 2016 were included. Using a previously developed composite measure nSES quintiles were evaluated as the primary exposure of interest. Latent class analysis was used to generate neighborhood archetypes based on 39 social and built environment attributes at the block group level which were evaluated as an exploratory exposure. Patients were observed from diagnosis through last available follow up. Cox proportional hazards univariate models were used to estimate crude hazard ratios HR for early death within 60 days following diagnosis and overall survival OS. Results Of the 8761 patients included 6338 were diagnosed with ALL and 2423 were diagnosed with AML. Median follow up time was 3.2 and 2.1 years respectively. Minority raceethnicity older age ampgt19 years lack of insurance lack of chemotherapy and treatment at an adult center were associated with lower OS in univariate models. Patients in the lowest quintile of nSES had an increased risk of early mortality for both ALL HR 1.91 95 CI 1.06 3.47 and AML HR 2.01 95 CI 1.17 3.45 relative to the highest quintile of nSES. Likewise patients in the lowest quintile of nSES had lower OS for both ALL HR 2.10 95 CI 1.68 2.62 and AML HR 1.40 95 CI 1.12 1.76. A dose effect was observed with worse OS observed among quintiles 2-4 as well. In patients with ALL relative to the highest status neighborhood archetype all other neighborhood archetypes demonstrated lower OS with the most pronounced effects in inner city HR 2.35 95 CI 1.79 3.09 Hispanic small towns HR 2.33 95 CI 1.74 3.11 and mixed SES class suburban neighborhoods HR 2.27 95 CI 1.65 3.12. While there was a suggestion of differences by archetype among AML patients none reached statistical significance. Conclusions The substantial crude effect of neighborhood SES on early mortality and overall survival highlights an important disparity. Multivariable adjustment for other known predictors of survival is underway. When other aspects of the socialbuilt environment are incorporated the magnitude of the effect grows suggesting that nSES interacts with other neighborhood factors such as the racialethnic makeup. The greater effects of neighborhood among ALL patients relative to AML patients may be linked to the prolonged outpatient nature of the therapy and difficulties with treatment adherence among vulnerable populations.jatsp jatspCitation Format Lena E Winestone Juan Yang Daphne Y Lichtensztajn Renata Abrahao Theresa H Keegan Iona Cheng Scarlett L Gomez Salma Shariff-Marco.

    "abstract": "This paper employs the theory of equality of opportunity described in Roemers book Equality of Opportunity Harvard University Press 1998 to compute the extent to which tax-and-transfer regimes in 11 countries equalize opportunities among citizens for income acquisition. Roughly speaking equality of opportunity for incomes has been achieved in a country when it is the case that the distributions of post-fisc income are the same for different types of citizen where a citizens type is defined by the socio-economic status of his parents. Intuitively a country will have equalized opportunity if the chances of earning high or low income are equal for citizens from all family backgrounds. Of course pre-fisc income distributions by type will not be identical as long as the educational system does not entirely make up for the disadvantage that children who come from poor families face but the tax-and-transfer system can play a role in rectifying that inequality. We include in our computation two numbers that summarize the extent to which each countrys current fiscal regime achieves equalization of opportunities for income and the deadweight loss that would be incurred by moving to the regime that does. 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "abstract": "The transcription factor serum response factor SRF plays a crucial role in the development of several organs. However its role in the skin has not been explored. Here we show that keratinocytes in normal human and mouse skin expressed high levels of SRF but that SRF expression was strongly downregulated in the hyperproliferative epidermis of wounded and psoriatic skin. Keratinocyte-specific deletion within the mouse SRF locus during embryonic development caused edema and skin blistering and all animals died in utero. Postnatal loss of mouse SRF in keratinocytes resulted in the development of psoriasis-like skin lesions. These lesions were characterized by inflammation hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes as well as by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Ultrastructural analysis revealed markedly reduced cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts and loss of cell compaction in all epidermal layers. siRNA-mediated knockdown of SRF in primary human keratinocytes revealed that the cytoskeletal abnormalities and adhesion defects were a direct consequence of the loss of SRF. In contrast the hyperproliferation observed in vivo was an indirect effect that was most likely a consequence of the inflammation. These results reveal that loss of SRF disrupts epidermal homeostasis and strongly suggest its involvement in the pathogenesis of hyperproliferative skin diseases including psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a federated learning FL based system is investigated with non-independent and identically distributed non-IID dataset where multiple devices participate in the global model aggregation through a limited number of sub-channels. By analyzing weight divergence and convergence rate a new metric is proposed based on age-of-information AoI which incorporates latency and can provide an advanced device selection standard. After that device selection sub-channel assignment and resource allocation are jointly designed in an overall AoI minimization problem under the maximum energy consumption constraint. The formulated problem is decoupled into two sub-problems. After analyzing the feasibility the resource allocation problem is transformed to a convex problem and the closed-from solution is obtained based on KKT conditions. By introducing virtual sub-channels device selection and sub-channel assignment are jointly solved by a matching based algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is able to outperform all baselines in terms of both test accuracy and sum AoI and the developed strategies can achieve significant improvements for all schemes.",

METHODS Preoperative and operative variables were reviewed for all patients treated for cardiac stab wounds at a level I trauma center from 1987 to 1993 in an attempt to identify factors influencing survival. RESULTS Twenty-nine 53 of the 55 patients who were resuscitated following stab wounds to the heart during the study period survived. Although profound hypotension systolic blood pressure 40 mm Hg cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency room thoracotomies were associated with poor outcome none were uniformly predictive of death. Some patients survived with each of these characteristics. CONCLUSIONS We recommend that all patients suspected of having cardiac stab wounds be fully resuscitated and undergo thoracotomy as significant survival can be achieved and death is not always the outcome.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To assess the use of a caudal external thoracic artery axial pattern flap to treat sternal cutaneous wounds in birds. ANIMALS 16 adult Japanese quail. PROCEDURE A cutaneous defect in the region of the mid-sternum was surgically created in all quail. In 6 quail group I an axial pattern flap was created from the skin of the lateral aspect of the thorax and advanced over the sternal defect. In 8 quail group II a flap was similarly created and advanced but the flap vasculature was ligated. All quail were euthanatized at 14 days after surgery and had necropsies performed. Sections of the flap and the surrounding tissue were examined histologically to assess flap viability. RESULTS All axial pattern flaps in group-I quail had 100 survival. In group II mean percentage area of flap survival was 62.5 mean area of necrosis and dermal fibrosis of flaps were significantly greater than that detected in group I. In flaps of group-II quail neovascularization in the deep dermis and profound necrosis of the vascular plexus in the superficial dermis were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that the caudal external thoracic artery axial pattern flap could be used successfully in the treatment of surgically created sternal cutaneous defects in quail with no signs of tissue necrosis or adverse effects overall. Use of this technique to treat self-mutilation syndromes or application after surgical debulking of tumors or other masses might be beneficial in many avian species.",

The combined effects of multiple guideline-recommended therapies in patients with symptomatic PAD have not been well characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS We analyzed a comprehensive database of all patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia CLI who underwent diagnostic or interventional lower-extremity angiography between June 1 2006 and May 1 2013 at a multidisciplinary vascular center. Baseline demographics clinical data and long-term outcomes were obtained. Inverse probability of treatment propensity weighting was used to determine the 3-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events MACE myocardial infarction stroke or death and major adverse limb events MALE major amputation thrombolysis or surgical bypass. Among 739 patients with PAD 325 44 had claudication and 414 56 had CLI. Guideline-recommended therapies at baseline included use of aspirin in 651 88 statin medications in 496 67 ACE inhibitors in 445 60 and smoking abstention in 528 71 patients. A total of 237 32 patients met all four guideline-recommended therapies. After adjustment for baseline covariates patients adhering to all four guideline-recommended therapies had decreased MACE hazard ratio HR 0.64 95 CI 0.45 to 0.89 P0.009 MALE HR 0.55 95 CI 0.37 to 0.83 P0.005 and mortality HR 0.56 95 CI 0.38 to 0.82 P0.003 compared to patients receiving less than four of the recommended therapies.

Current industry methods lack the predictive capacity to accurately estimate how well a wort will ferment in the brewhouse. Wort from two mashing styles high-temperature infusion and low-temperature ramping and under varying grist to liquor GL ratios were produced and the differences in maltose maltotriose and glucose were measured. The two mashing styles showed differences in original extract Plato values between the GL ratios with a 12 GL having the highest original extract. Maltose was the most abundant sugar in all sample types. All worts were scanned using Fourier transform infrared FTIR and the spectra also showed differences between the original extract and final extract with most of the changes around the spectral region associated with carbohydrates a result of sugar utilization by the yeast. FTIR calibrations for extract and fermentable sugars all had r2 values 0.98 with ratio of standard error of prediction to standard deviation 5. The results indicated changing fermentable sugar levels thus making a prediction of fermentability possible. The FTIR also provided a rapid measure of changes in the fermentable sugar profile which could assist maltsters and brewers in monitoring malt and beer quality.

Recent studies have shown that massively parallel sequencing MPS using a targeted gene panel is particularly suited for diagnostic testing for genetically heterogeneous conditions. We report on our experiences with using massively parallel sequencing of a targeted gene panel of 355 genes for investigating the genetic etiology of eight patients with a wide range of phenotypes including DDID congenital anomalies andor autism spectrum disorder. Targeted sequence enrichment was performed using the Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment Kit and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 using paired-end reads. For all eight patients 81-84 of the targeted regions achieved read depths of at least 20 with average read depths overlapping targets ranging from 322 to 798. Causative variants were successfully identified in two of the eight patients a nonsense mutation in the ATRX gene and a canonical splice site mutation in the L1CAM gene. In a third patient a canonical splice site variant in the USP9X gene could likely explain all or some of her clinical phenotypes. These results confirm the value of targeted MPS for investigating DDID in children for diagnostic purposes. However targeted gene MPS was less likely to provide a genetic diagnosis for children whose phenotype includes autism.",

    "abstract": "PROBLEM Utility All-Terrain Vehicles ATVs are one major cause of youth injuries and fatalities on farms. Utility ATVs have heavy weights and fast speeds that require complex maneuvering. Youths physical capabilities may not be sufficient to perform those complex maneuvers correctly. Therefore it is hypothesized that most youth engage in ATV-related incidents because they ride vehicles unfit for them. There is a need to assess ATV-youth fit based on youth anthropometry. METHOD This study focused on evaluating potential inconsistencies between the operational requirements of utility ATVs and the anthropometric measures of youth through virtual simulations. Virtual simulations were performed to assess 11 youth-ATV fit guidelines proposed by several ATV safety advocacy organizations National 4-H council CPSC IPCH and FReSH. In total 17 utility ATVs along with male-and-female-youth of nine ages 8 to 16 years old and three height percentiles 5th 50th and 95th were evaluated. RESULTS The results demonstrated a physical mismatch between ATVs operational requirements and youths anthropometry. For example male-youth aged 16 of the 95th height percentile failed to pass at least 1 out of the 11 fit guidelines for 35 of all vehicles evaluated. The results were even more concerning for females. Female youth 10 years old and younger from all height percentiles failed to pass at least one fit guideline for all ATVs evaluated. DISCUSSION Youth are not recommended to ride utility ATVs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This study provides quantitative and systematic evidence to modify current ATV safety guidelines. Furthermore youth occupational health professionals could use the present findings to prevent ATV-related incidents in agricultural settings.",

A critical yet overlooked aspect of understanding event processes is recognizing that not all step events hold equal importance toward the completion of a goal. In this paper we address this gap by examining the extent to which current models comprehend the essentiality of step events in relation to a goal event. Cognitive studies suggest that such capability enables machines to emulate human commonsense reasoning about preconditions and necessary efforts of everyday tasks. We contribute a high-quality corpus of goal step pairs gathered from the community guideline website WikiHow with steps manually annotated for their essentiality concerning the goal by experts. The high inter-annotator agreement demonstrates that humans possess a consistent understanding of event essentiality. However after evaluating multiple statistical and large-scale pre-trained language models we find that existing approaches considerably underperform compared to humans. This observation highlights the need for further exploration into this critical and challenging task.",

A whole-plant dose-response study and a rapid assay that measured electrolyte leakage was used to determine the response of wild mustard soybean and protox inhibitor-susceptible and protox inhibitor-resistant common waterhemp to increasing doses of three protox inhibitors acifluorfen fomesafen and sulfentrazone. For the dose-response study whole plants were treated with the three protox-inhibitor herbicides. Electroconductivity assay 1 consisted of cutting discs from leaf tissue and submerging them in an incubation medium containing concentrations of acifluorfen fomesafen or sulfentrazone. In electroconductivity assay 2 the entire leaf was treated with solutions containing acifluorfen fomesafen or sulfentrazone. The whole-plant dose-response study showed increasing visible injury with increasing herbicide rates for all species and all herbicides. The order of visible injury was wild mustard susceptible common waterhemp resistant common waterhemp soybean. In assay 1 electrolyte leakage from leaf discs treated with acifluorfen or fomesafen increased with increasing herbicide concentrations and was similar for all species. In contrast electrolyte leakage from leaf discs treated with sulfentrazone did not increase with increasing herbicide concentrations for any species. In assay 2 only wild mustard leaf discs increased in electrolyte leakage with increasing herbicide rates of acifluorfen fomesafen and sulfentrazone and followed the regression curves established by the whole-plant dose-response study. However assay 2 was not able to distinguish between susceptible wild mustard and tolerant soybean or between susceptible and resistant waterhemp.",

The connectivity of the patches and costs of dispersal are determined by a k k column substochastic matrix S where S ij represents the fraction of dispersing individuals from patch j that end up in patch i. Given S a dispersal strategy is a K 1 vector whose ith entry gives the probability P i that individuals disperse from patch i. If all of the p is are the same then the dispersal strategy is called unconditional otherwise it is called conditional. For two competing populations of unconditional dispersers we prove that the slower dispersing population i.e. the population with the smaller dispersal probability displaces the faster dispersing population. Alternatively for populations of conditional dispersers without any dispersal costs i.e. S is column stochastic and all patches can support a population we prove that there is a one parameter family of strategies that resists invasion attempts by all other strategies. 2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",

Children with autism have difficulties with several abilities generally thought to be related to deferred imitation immediate imitation language and symbolic play. However few studies have examined deferred imitation in early autism. The present study examined both deferred spontaneous imitation and immediate elicited imitation on a set of carefully matched tasks in 36 young children with autism 16 with early onset autism 20 with regressive autism and two contrast groups younger typically developing children n 20 and age matched children with significant developmental delays n 21. Analyses of co-variance controlling for differences in verbal mental age revealed significant main effects for task but no main effect of group and no interaction of task by group. Deferred imitation scores were lower than immediate imitation scores for all groups. Imitation performance was related to overall intellectual functioning for all groups and there were moderate and significant relations between imitation in the immediate elicited condition and in the spontaneous deferred condition for all groups. Finally there were no differences between onset subgroups in imitation scores suggesting that the two share a similar phenotype involving both types of imitation.",

    "abstract": "From February 2020 to March 2022 four southern sea otters Enhydra lutris nereis stranded in California with severe protozoal steatitis and systemic toxoplasmosis. Three of the infected otters stranded within 26 km of each other and all four animals died during periods of increased rainfall-driven surface water runoff. High parasite burdens were observed in all tissues except the central nervous system and toxoplasmosis with severe protozoal steatitis was the primary cause of death for all cases. This lesion pattern differs substantially from all prior reports of toxoplasmosis in sea otters. All cases were T. gondii-positive via serology immunohistochemistry and PCR. Multilocus sequence typing at 13 loci revealed that all were infected with the same strain of T. gondii previously characterized as an atypical and rare genotype in North America TgCgCa1 or COUG. The COUG genotype was first isolated from mountain lions in British Columbia Canada during investigation of a waterborne outbreak of toxoplasmosis in humans. This genotype has not been previously reported from sea otters nor any aquatic species. All prior T. gondii strains obtained from 140 southern sea otters represent Type II or Type X strains or variants of these genotypes. Archival necropsy data 1000 animals over 24 years were negative for prior cases of severe T. gondii-associated steatitis prior to the cases described herein and no sublethal COUG T. gondii infections have been previously indentified in sea otters. According to prior studies the T. gondii COUG genotype is highly virulent in mice and is unusual among T. gondii isolates in eliciting a Type I interferon response in murine and human cells in vitro this unusual immunomodulatory response could explain the apparent high virulence of this atypical T. gondii strain. Our findings reveal a novel and concerning lesion pattern for sea otters with toxoplasmosis. Due to high zoonotic potential and the risk of infection via shared marine food resources these findings may also indicate potential health threats for other animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "Efficient inactivation and removal of pathogenic biofilms in food and biomedical environments remain a significant challenge for food safety applications and medical facilities. This research aims to develop food-grade microcarriers for the targeted delivery of a photosensitizer curcumin and photodynamic inactivation of a model pathogenic bacterial biofilm. The microcarriers evaluated in this study include alive yeast cell carriers deactivated yeast cell carriers and yeast cell wall particles. The microcarriers were evaluated based on the encapsulation yield of a model photosensitizer curcumin binding of the microcarriers to biofilms and inactivation of the bacteria in the biofilms. The results illustrate that the combination of binding affinity encapsulation yield and the intracellular composition of the microcarriers influenced the overall inactivation of bacteria in the biofilms. All of the selected compositions achieved more than 93 inactivation of the bacteria in the biofilm using the photodynamic treatment and the yeast cell wall particles with curcumin achieved over 99 inactivation of the bacteria in the biofilm matrix. In addition all of the selected compositions demonstrated significant potential to remove the biofilm from the plastic surface suggesting the role of binding affinity of the microcarriers in removal of the biofilm from surfaces. Overall this study developed biomaterial formulations for targeted photodynamic inactivation and potential removal of biofilms.",

    "abstract": "The class-I helical cytokines constitute a large group of signalling molecules that play key roles in a plethora of physiological processes including host defence immune regulation somatic growth reproduction food intake and energy metabolism regulation of neural growth and many more. Despite little primary amino acid sequence similarity the view that all contemporary class-I helical cytokines have expanded from a single ancestor is widely accepted as all class-I helical cytokines share a similar three-dimensional fold signal via related class-I helical cytokine receptors and activate similar intracellular signalling cascades. Virtually all of our knowledge on class-I helical cytokine signalling derives from research on primate and rodent species. Information on the presence structure and function of class-I helical cytokines in non-mammalian vertebrates and non-vertebrates is fragmentary. Consequently our ideas about the evolution of this versatile multigene family are often based on a limited comparison of human and murine orthologs. In the last 5 years whole genome sequencing projects have yielded draft genomes of the early vertebrates pufferfish Takifugu rubripes spotted green pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis and zebrafish Danio rerio. Fuelled by this development fish orthologs of a number of mammalian class-I helical cytokines have recently been discovered. In this review we have characterised the mammalian class-I helical cytokine family and compared it with the emerging class-I helical cytokine repertoire of teleost fish. This approach offers important insights into cytokine evolution as it identifies the helical cytokines shared by fish and mammals that consequently existed before the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods. A fish-mammalian comparison will identify the class-I helical cytokines that still await discovery in fish or alternatively may have been evolutionarily recent additions to the mammalian cytokine repertoire.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This article describes a common methodology and measurement technique encompassing both conventional helical and axial CT scanning using phantom translation and cone beam or narrow fan beam CT scans about a stationary phantom. Cone beam CT systems having beam widths along the z-axis wide enough to cover a significant anatomical length 50-160 mm in a single axial rotation e.g. in cardiac CT are rapidly proliferating in the clinic referred to herein as stationary cone beam CT SCBCT. The integral format of the CTDI paradigm is not appropriate for a stationary phantom and is not useful for predicting the dose in SCBCT nor for perfusion studies or CT fluoroscopy. Likewise the pencil chamber has limited utility in this domain even one of extended length. METHODS By demonstrating both experimentally and theoretically the match between the dose distribution fz for a wide cone beam and that due to an axial scan series Dz it is shown that the dose on the central ray of the cone beam f0 is both spatially colocated and numerically equal to the dose predicted by CTDI for the axial series and thus f0 is the logical and unique choice for a SCBCT dose-descriptor consistent with the CTDI-based dose of conventional CT. This dose f0 can be readily measured using a conventional short ionization chamber. Additionally Monte Carlo simulations of Boone J. M.

RESULTS Useful commonalities between SCBCT and conventional CT dose are revealed including a common equilibrium dose parameter Aeq which is independent of z-collimator aperture a or n x T and a common analytical exponential growth function Hlambda describing the relative approach to scatter equilibrium at z 0 for both modalities with lambda a or lambda scan length L.

In this study face-validity of the Modified National ED OverCrowding Score mNEDOCS was assessed in a high-volume ED as well as in a low-volume ED. METHODS A prospective observational cohort study was performed in the Netherlands. The correlation of the mNEDOCS with ED staff perceptions of crowding were assessed using weighted Kappa and Pearson correlation. Subsequently ED process measures elapsed target times to triage elapsed target times to treatment and patients LOS were described under different levels of ED crowding. RESULTS Correlation between the categorized crowding scores was low weighted 0.34 resp. 0.26. However good correlations of 0.73 and 0.82 were found between the uncategorized mNEDOCS and ED staffs perception of crowding. Percentages of patients with elapsed target times to treatment increased simultaneously with increasingly busy periods when measured with mNEDOCS. CONCLUSIONS The uncategorized mNEDOCS correlates well with perceived crowding even at a low-volume ED. Determining a cut-off level at which a specific ED can be identified as crowded is important because the predefined mNEDOCS categories may not be optimal for all EDs.",

    "abstract": "Reversible protein phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism involved in all cellular processes. To create a systems view of the signaling apparatus in budding yeast we generated an epistatic miniarray profile E-MAP comprised of 100000 pairwise quantitative genetic interactions including virtually all protein and small-molecule kinases and phosphatases as well as key cellular regulators. Quantitative genetic interaction mapping reveals factors working in compensatory pathways negative genetic interactions or those operating in linear pathways positive genetic interactions. We found an enrichment of positive genetic interactions between kinases phosphatases and their substrates. In addition we assembled a higher-order map from sets of three genes that display strong interactions with one another triplets enriched for functional connectivity. The resulting network view provides insights into signaling pathway regulation and reveals a link between the cell-cycle kinase Cak1 the Fus3 MAP kinase and a pathway that regulates chromatin integrity during transcription by RNA polymerase II.",

    "abstract": "Natural resource management decisions can be based on incomplete knowledge when they lack scientific research monitoring and assessment andor simultaneously fail to draw on local ecological knowledge. Many community-based forestry organizations in the United States attempt to address these knowledge gaps with an integrated ecological stewardship approach that balances ecological social and economic goals. This paper examines the use and integration of local knowledge and conventional science in ecological stewardship and monitoring by seven community-based forestry demonstration projects. Through document reviews and interviews with both participants and partners of all of these communitybased organizations we found that all the community-based forestry groups incorporated local ecological knowledge into many aspects of their management or monitoring activities such as collaboratively designing monitoring programs with local ranchers forest workers and residents involving local people in collecting data and interpreting results and documenting the local ecological knowledge of private forest landowners long-time residents and harvesters of nontimber forest products. We found that all the groups also used conventional science to design or conduct ecological assessments monitoring or research. We also found evidence in the form of changes in attitudes on the part of local people and conventional scientists and jointly produced reports that the two types of knowledge were integrated by all groups. These findings imply that community-based forestry groups are redistributing the power of conventional science through the use of diverse knowledge sources. Still several obstacles prevented some local traditionally under-represented groups from being significantly involved in monitoring and management decisions and their knowledge has not yet been consistently incorporated.",

Herein we assessed the potency of flupyradifurone a novel pesticide on fourth instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus Say. Further we evaluated the synergistic action of piperonyl butoxide PBO and the octopamine receptor agonists OR agonists chlordimeform CDM and amitraz AMZ on the toxicity of flupyradifurone in comparison with sulfoxaflor and nitenpyram to increase their toxicity on Cx. quinquefasciatus. Results demonstrated that flupyradifurone was the most potent pesticide followed by sulfoxaflor and nitenpyram. Further the synergetic effect of PBO CDM and AMZ was significant for all selected pesticides especially flupyradifurone. However AMZ had the most significant effect in combination with the selected pesticides followed by CDM and PBO. The toxicity of the pesticides was time-dependent and increased over time from 24 48 to 72 h of exposure in all experiments. The results indicate that flupyradifurone is a promising component in future mosquito control programs.",

Methods We analyzed data from adults aged 18 years without coronary heart disease and chronic kidney disease n 29226 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010 and the associated mortality data up to December 2011. We used the Cox proportional hazards models to examine the risk of all-cause and cause-specific cardiovascular disease CVD and cancer mortality at different UA levels between adults with and without diabetes. Results Over a median follow-up of 6.6 years 2069 participants died 495 from CVD and 520 from cancers. In non-diabetes adults at UA 5 mgdL all-cause and CVD mortality risks increased across higher UA levels p-for-trend 0.037 and 0.058 respectively. The lowest all-cause mortality risk in participants with diabetes was at the UA level of 5-7 mgdL. We set the non-diabetes participants with UA levels of 7 mgdL as a reference group. Without considering the effect of glycemic control the all-cause mortality risk in non-diabetes participants with UA levels of 7 mgdL was equivalent to risk among diabetes adults with UA levels of 7 mgdL hazard ratio 1.44 vs. 1.57 p 0.49. A similar result was shown in CVD mortality risk hazard ratio 1.80 vs. 2.06 p 0.56. Conclusion Hyperuricemia may be an indicator to manage multifaceted cardiovascular risk factors in low-risk adults without diabetes but further studies and replication are warranted.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective study of 58 consecutive patients with documented laryngopharyngeal reflux all of whom underwent transnasal esophagoscopy as part of their reflux evaluations. METHODS All patients with a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux confirmed by abnormal pharyngeal pH monitoring over a 5-month period were included and all subjects completed a self-administered reflux symptom index and underwent transnasal esophagoscopy with directed biopsy. RESULTS Of the 58 study patients with pH-documented laryngopharyngeal reflux the mean age was 49 years - 13 y and 53 31 of 58 were women. Of the study group 40 23 of 58 had heartburn and 48 28 of 58 had abnormal esophageal reflux by pH monitoring criteria by transnasal esophagoscopy with biopsy 12 7 of 58 had esophagitis and another 7 4 of 58 had Barretts metaplasia. Thus 60 of the study cohort had heartburn and 81 47 of 58 had normal esophageal epithelium i.e. esophagitis or Barretts metaplasia. CONCLUSIONS In the present series of patients with documented laryngopharyngeal reflux the prevalence of esophagitis and Barretts metaplasia was only 19. These data confirm the clinical impression that the patterns mechanisms and manifestations of laryngopharyngeal reflux differ from those of classic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Unlike gastroesophageal reflux disease patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux uncommonly have esophagitis. Thus although esophagoscopy may be an excellent method for screening the esophagus it is not the method of choice for diagnosing laryngopharyngeal reflux.",

STUDY DESIGN We conducted an exploratory prospective descriptive study of women undergoing DE between 15 weeks 0 days and 23 weeks 6 days of gestation. Enrolled participants had Kleihauer-Betke testing on specimens obtained before and after DE. We assessed the main outcome measures of FMH in mL suggesting need for more than 100 mcg and 300 mcg RhIG FMH of 10 mL and 30 mL fetal whole blood respectively and association of postprocedure FMH with demographic characteristics and procedure-related variables. RESULTS The 300 participants had a mean gestational age of 19 weeks 6 days2 weeks 2 days. The median preprocedure FMH was 0 mL range 0-50 mL with 2 0.67 women exceeding 10 mL 19 mL and 50 mL. The median postprocedure FMH was 1 mL range 0-60 mL. Almost all participants had postprocedure FMH 10 mL n295 98.3 and 30 mL n298 99.3. All participants under 18 weeks had FMH 10 mL. We found no demographic or procedure-related factors to be predictive of FMH quantity. CONCLUSIONS FMH occurring with routine second-trimester DE procedures is minimal. Adequate prophylaxis with RhIG 100 mcg and 300 mcg occurred in 98 of women and in all cases 18 weeks of gestation. This study is the first step to potentially reducing the dose and costs of RhIG administration with DE. IMPLICATIONS This study is a first step in quantifying fetomaternal hemorrhage with routine dilation and evacuation procedures larger trials are needed especially to understand why some women have recognizable hemorrhage preprocedure. If dosing requirements are too high with current guidelines lower doses will result in resource and cost savings.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To localize and identify the gene and mutations causing autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in three consanguineous Pakistani families. METHODS Blood samples were collected and DNA was extracted. A genome-wide scan was performed by using 382 polymorphic microsatellite markers on genomic DNA from affected and unaffected family members and lod scores were calculated. RESULTS A genome-wide scan of 25 families gave an hlod 4.53 with D8S260. Retinitis pigmentosa in all three families mapped to a 14.21-cM 21.19-Mb region on chromosome 8 at q11 flanked by D8S532 and D8S260. This region harbors RP1 which is known to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Sequencing of the coding exons of RP1 showed mutations in all three families two single-base deletions c.4703delA and c.5400delA resulting in a frame shift and a 4-bp insertion c.1606insTGAA all causing premature termination of the protein. All affected individuals in these families are homozygous for the mutations. Parents and siblings heterozygous for the mutant allele did not show any signs or symptoms of RP. CONCLUSIONS These results provide strong evidence that mutations in RP1 can result in recessive as well as dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The findings suggest that truncation of RP1 before the BIF motif or within the terminal portion results in a simple loss of RP1 function producing a recessive inheritance pattern. In contrast disruption of RP1 within or immediately after the BIF domain may result in a protein with a deleterious effect and hence a dominant inheritance pattern.",

Care at specialized cancer centers SCC Childrens Oncology Group affiliated andor National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center has been found to improve outcomes in patients with leukemia but studies have not considered location of care and outcomes in EWS and OS patients an ideal group to evaluate given their specialized multidisciplinary treatment needs. METHODS Patients hospitalized with primary EWS and OS 2000-2014 were identified using the California Cancer Registry linked with hospitalization data. Patients were divided into age groups 0-18 19-39 40 years and classified on whether they received all versus partnone of their inpatient treatment at a SCC within 1 year of diagnosis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors associated with survival. RESULTS There were 531 ES and 959 OS patients. Five-year overall survival was better for patients with EWS all 63 vs. partnone 42 and OS all 64 vs. partnone 47 who received all of their treatment at a SCC. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors receiving all inpatient cancer treatment at a SCC was associated with superior overall survival EWS HR 0.49 CI 0.37-0.67 OS HR 0.78 CI 0.63-0.97. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that treatment for EWS and OS at a SCC is associated with significantly improved survival even after adjustment for known prognostic factors. The superior survival among those treated at SCCs may be due to having greater access to clinical trials and services at SCCs.",

ANIMALS Dogs n6 with uncomplicated GBM. METHODS Dogs with ultrasonographic evidence of GBM but without imaging or laboratory signs of gall bladder rupture peritonitis or extra-hepatic biliary tract rupture that had LC were included. A 4 portal technique was used. A fan retractor was used to retract the gall bladder to allow dissection around the cystic duct with 5 or 10 mm right-angle dissecting forceps. The cystic duct was ligated using extracorporeally tied ligatures supplemented sometimes with hemostatic clips. A harmonic scalpel was used to dissect the gall bladder from its fossa. The gall bladder was placed into a specimen retrieval bag and after bile aspiration the bag was withdrawn through the 11 mm portal incision. RESULTS Five dogs had mild intermittent clinical signs including vomiting inappetence and lethargy. All dogs had successful LC without conversion to an open approach. All dogs with clinical signs had improvement or resolution of signs postoperatively. No important perioperative complications occurred and all dogs were alive at a median of 8 months postoperatively range 3-14 months. CONCLUSIONS LC can be accomplished safely and effectively in dogs with uncomplicated GBM. CLINICAL RELEVANCE A minimally invasive approach for cholecystectomy can be used for the treatment of GBM in dogs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Few previous studies investigating depression before the diagnosis of breast cancer and breast cancer-specific mortality have examined depression measured at more than 1 time point. This study investigated the effect of depression combining depressive symptoms alone with antidepressant use measured at 2 time points before the diagnosis of breast cancer on all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality among older postmenopausal women. METHODS A large prospective cohort the Womens Health Initiative was used. The study included 3095 women with incident breast cancer who had measures of depressive symptoms and antidepressant use before their diagnosis at the baseline and at year 3. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios HRs between depression at the baseline depression at year 3 and combinations of depression at these time points and all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS Depression at year 3 before a breast cancer diagnosis was associated with higher all-cause mortality after adjustments for multiple covariates HR 1.35 95 confidence interval CI 1.02-1.78. There was no statistically significant association of baseline depression and all-cause mortality or breast cancer-specific mortality whether or not depression was also present at year 3. In women with late-stage regional- or distant-stage breast cancer newly developed depression at year 3 was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality HR 2.00 95 CI 1.13-3.56 and breast cancer-specific mortality HR 2.42 95 CI 1.24-4.70. CONCLUSIONS Women with newly developed depression before the diagnosis of breast cancer had a modestly but significantly increased risk for death from any cause and for death from breast cancer at a late stage.

METHODS We studied individual-level SES measured by self-reported education and a composite neighborhood SES nSES measure in females 1068 non-Hispanic whites 1670 Hispanics 993 African-Americans and 674 Asian-Americans ages 18 to 79 years and diagnosed 1995 to 2008 in the San Francisco Bay Area. We evaluated all-cause and breast cancer-specific survival using stage-stratified Cox proportional hazards models with cluster adjustment for census block groups. RESULTS In models adjusting for education and nSES lower nSES was associated with worse all-cause survival among African-Americans P trend 0.03 Hispanics P trend 0.01 and Asian-Americans P trend 0.01. Education was not associated with all-cause survival. For breast cancer-specific survival lower nSES was associated with poorer survival only among Asian-Americans P trend 0.01. When nSES and education were jointly considered women with low education and low nSES had 1.4 to 2.7 times worse all-cause survival than women with high education and high nSES across all racesethnicities. Among African-Americans and Asian-Americans women with high education and low nSES had 1.6 to 1.9 times worse survival respectively. For breast cancer-specific survival joint associations were found only among Asian-Americans with worse survival for those with low nSES regardless of education. CONCLUSIONS Both neighborhood and individual SES are associated with survival after breast cancer diagnosis but these relationships vary by raceethnicity. IMPACT A better understanding of the relative contributions and interactions of SES with other factors will inform targeted interventions toward reducing long-standing disparities in breast cancer survival.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia TDH is rare in children most often occurring following blunt thoracoabdominal trauma from high energy mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions MVC. We performed a systematic review to describe injury details and management. METHODS Following PRISMA guidelines a systematic literature search was performed to identify publications of blunt TDH in patients 18 y old. Conflicts were resolved by consensus. Data were collected on demographics TDH location mechanism of injury associated intraabdominal injuries IAI management and outcomes. Denominators vary depending on number of patients with such information reported. RESULTS Fifty-eight articles were reviewed with 142 patients with TDH. The median age was seven y range 0.25-16. Most were left-sided 85 of 126 67.5. MVC was the most common mechanism 66 of 142 46.5. IAI was present in 50.0 57 of 114 most commonly liver injuries 25 of 57 43.9. Delayed diagnoses occurred in 49.6 57 of 115 range 8 h-10 y and were more common with right-sided TDH 76.0 versus 48.5 P 0.02. Chest radiography was 59.0 sensitive for TDH while computed tomography sensitivity was 65.8. Operative repair was performed on all surviving patients and all underwent primary diaphragm repair. The overall mortality was 11.3 n 16 with four attributable to the TDH. There were no reported recurrences over a median follow-up of 12 mo. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric TDH is a rare diagnosis with a high rate of associated IAI and delayed diagnosis. Primary diaphragm repair was performed in all cases. Surgeons should maintain a high suspicion for diaphragm injury in blunt thoracoabdominal trauma.",

The current cross-sectional study evaluated specific domains of EF and varied health behaviors in three pediatric life stages. Pediatric participants early childhood n 2074 Mage 6.4 0.9 y middle childhood n 3230 Mage 9.6 1.2 y adolescence n 1416 Mage 15.2 1.7 y were part of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes ECHO Program. They completed neurocognitive tasks measuring cognitive flexibility behavioral inhibition and working memory. Parent- andor child-report measures of dietary intake physical activity sleep duration and quality income and positive parenting were also collected. Neighborhood crime and greenspace were calculated from publicly available census-tract level indices. After adjusting for study site child body mass index and demographics working memory was related in the hypothesized direction to several dietary behaviors within all pediatric life stages. Working memory and cognitive flexibility were positively related to physical activity in middle childhood and adolescence. In adolescence behavioral inhibition was positively related to physical activity and inversely related to sugar-sweetened beverage and total caloric intake. Associations with sleep were all non-significant. All significant associations reflected small effect sizes. Income positive parenting greenspace and crime did not significantly influence any of the EF-health behavior associations. Findings highlight the need to consider EF domains specific health behaviors and developmental stage in creating intervention strategies that target EF to improve health behaviors. The small effect sizes reinforce the need for multi-tiered interventions to maximize health.",

The impact of different pathophysiologic mechanisms on outcome is unknown. In this large single-center study we aimed to assess the incidence of GD and compare the outcomes with different histopathologic mechanisms of rejection. METHODS We analyzed a data set of 1099 consecutive patients after their HTx at Columbia University Medical Center between January 1994 and March 2008 and identified all patients hospitalized with new-onset GD. Based on the histopathologic data patients were divided into GD-unexplained Group-GD-U GD-antibody-mediated rejection Group-GD-AMR GD-cardiac allograft vasculopathy Group-GD-CAV and GD-acute cellular rejection Group-GD-ACR groups. We compared the in-hospital and 3- 6- and 12-month mortality across these groups using the chi-square test. We also compared the 3- 6- and 12-month survival curves across groups using the log-rank test. RESULTS Of 126 patients 12 identified with GD complete histology data were available for 100 patients. There were 21 20 27 and 32 patients identified in Group-GD-U Group-GD-AMR Group-GD-CAV and Group-GD-ACR respectively. The in-hospital mortality rates were 52 20 15 and 6 respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in Group-GD-U compared with all other groups p 0.0006. The 3- 6- and 12-month survival rate was also significantly lower in Group-GD-U compared with all other groups. CONCLUSION A significant proportion of patients presenting with new-onset GD have unexplained histopathology. Unexplained GD is associated with a significantly higher mortality rate. New diagnostic tools are necessary to better understand and detectpredict this malignant phenotype.",

Unlike previous formulations of graph matching our approach is BFS-based by traversing the graph in an all-source-BFS manner and thus can be mapped onto GPUs in a massively parallel fashion. Our implementation uses the Gunrock programming model and we evaluate our implementation in runtime and memory consumption compared with previous state-of-the-art work. We sustain a peak traversed-edges-per-second TEPS rate of nearly 10 GTEPS. Our algorithm is the most scalable and parallel among all existing GPU implementations and also outperforms all existing CPU distributed implementations. This work specifically focuses on leveraging our implementation on the triangle counting problem for the Subgraph Isomorphism Graph Challenge 2019 demonstrating a geometric mean speedup over the 2018 champion of 3.84 times .",

    "abstract": "There is growing awareness that complex interactions among multiple genes and environmental factors play an important role in controlling obesity traits. The BSB mouse which is produced by the backcross of lean C57BL6J x lean Mus spretus x C57BL6J provides an excellent model of epistatic obesity. To evaluate potential epistatic interactions among six chromosomal regions previously determined to influence obesity phenotypes we performed novel Bayesian analyses on the basis of both epistatic and nonepistatic models for four obesity traits percentage of body fat adiposity index total fat mass and body weight and also for plasma total cholesterol. The epistatic analysis detected at least one more QTL than the nonepistatic analysis did for all obesity traits. These obesity traits were variously influenced by QTL on chromosomes 2 7 12 15 and 16. Interaction between genes on chromosomes 2 and 12 was present for all obesity traits accounting for 3-4.8 of the phenotypic variation. Chromosome 12 was found to have weak main effects on all obesity traits. Several different epistatic interactions were also detected for percentage of body fat adiposity index and total fat mass. Chromosomes 6 and 12 have not only main effects but also strong epistatic effects on plasma total cholesterol. Our results emphasize the importance of modeling epistasis for discovery of obesity genes.",

Five 50 of 10 A. weddellii serum samples tested by complement fixation CF for psittacine polyomavirus antibodies were positive and three 19 of 16 A. weddellii samples tested by virus neutralization VN for psittacine polyomavirus antibodies were positive yielding a total of 8 38 of the 21 A. weddellii samples positive for psittacine polyomavirus. Based on CF for herpesvirus four 11 of 38 A. weddellii samples had antibodies against herpesvirus. All B. sanctithomae were negative for psittacine polyomavirus and psittacine herpesvirus. Thirty-five of the A. weddellii tested were negative for Chlamydia psittaci by CF latex agglutination and elementary body agglutination and all B. sanctithomae were negative for Chlamydia psittaci by the CF test. Nine A. weddellii and eight B. sanctithomae evaluated for paramyxovirus-1 titers by the hemagglutination inhibition test were negative.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To determine the clinical impact of calculated dose differences between effective path length EPL and Monte Carlo MC algorithms in stereotactic ablative radiation therapy SABR of lung tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS We retrospectively analyzed the treatment plans and clinical outcomes of 77 consecutive patients treated with SABR for 82 lung tumors between 2003 and 2009 at our institution. Sixty treatments were originally planned using EPL and 22 using MC. All plans were recalculated for the same beam specifications using MC and EPL respectively. The doses covering 95 50 and 5 D95 D50 D5 respectively of the target volumes were compared between EPL and MC assumed to be the actual delivered dose both as physical dose and biologically effective dose. Time to local recurrence was correlated with dose by Cox regression analysis. The relationship between tumor control probability TCP and biologically effective dose was determined via logistic regression and used to estimate the TCP decrements due to prescribing by EPL calculations. RESULTS EPL overestimated dose compared with MC in all tumor dose-volume histogram parameters in all plans. The difference was 10 of the MC D95 to the planning target volume and gross tumor volume in 60 of 82 73 and 52 of 82 plans 63 respectively. Local recurrence occurred in 13 of 82 tumors. Controlling for gross tumor volume higher physical and biologically effective planning target volume D95 correlated significantly with local control P .007 and P .045 respectively. Compared with MC prescribing based on EPL translated to a median TCP decrement of 4.3 range 1.2-37 and a 5 decrement in 46 of tumors. CONCLUSIONS Clinical follow-up for local lung tumor control in a sizable cohort of patients treated with SABR demonstrates that EPL overestimates dose by amounts that substantially decrease TCP in a large proportion. EPL algorithms should be avoided for lung tumor SABR.",

    "abstract": "Research has found differences in responding to various sensory stimuli among autistic individuals which are associated with social and adaptive skills. However our understanding of sensory profiles in autism has been complicated due to the variable presentation of sensory symptoms. One way to better understand variability in sensory symptoms is to use advanced statistical approaches such as latent profile analysis that allow for the identification of more similar sensory classes in otherwise variable groups. We used the Short Sensory Profile to identify homogeneous classes of sensory reactivity in autistic children based on both severity and modality and examined whether sensory classes differed in terms of autism characteristics adaptive skills and attention-deficithyperactivity disorder symptoms. Based on the pattern of both severity and modality four sensory classes emerged and were named ModerateMixed 35.5 probable-to-definite differences in all modalities except in movement sensitivity and low energyweakness SevereMixed 8.5 definite sensory differences in all modalities except in low energyweakness ModerateBroad 14.6 probable-to-definite differences in all modalities and LowMixed 41.1 typical scores in most modalities with probable differences in tastesmell sensitivity under-responsiveseeks sensation and auditory filtering. The SevereMixed class exhibited greater problems in a variety of areas such as social adaptive and attention-deficithyperactivity disorder symptoms whereas the LowMixed class showed overall fewer problems. This may provide insight for clinicians and researchers aiming to understand whether autistic children who exhibit distinct sensory patterns are more or less likely to also experience social adaptive andor attentionbehavior-related difficulties.",

The primary objective of ADNI was and continues to be improving methods for clinical trials in Alzheimers disease. Our approach to the present ADNI-GO and future ADNI-2 if funded MRI protocol will be to maintain MRI methodological consistency in the previously enrolled ADNI-1 subjects who are followed up longitudinally in ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. We will modernize and expand the MRI protocol for all newly enrolled ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 subjects. All newly enrolled subjects will be scanned at 3T with a core set of three sequence types 3D T1-weighted volume FLAIR and a long TE gradient echo volumetric acquisition for micro hemorrhage detection. In addition to this core ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 protocol we will perform vendor-specific pilot sub-studies of arterial spin-labeling perfusion resting state functional connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging. One of these sequences will be added to the core protocol on systems from each MRI vendor. These experimental sub-studies are designed to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring useful data in a multicenter but single vendor setting for these three emerging MRI applications.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Adolescents and young adults AYAs diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 years of age often report need for greater amounts of cancer-related information and perceive that cancer has had a negative impact on control over their life. We examined whether unmet information need and perceived control over life are associated with health-related quality of life HRQOL. METHODS We examined data from 484 AYA cancer survivors recruited from population-based cancer registries in 2007-2008. Participants completed surveys a median of 11 months after diagnosis. Multivariable linear regression analyses estimated associations of unmet cancer-related information needs and impact of cancer on control over life on HRQOL SF-12. RESULTS Two-thirds of AYAs reported an intermediate or high level of unmet information need and half 47 reported a negative impact of cancer on control. Greater unmet information need was associated with lower overall mental and physical HRQOL and lower levels of all HRQOL subscales except vitality. A negative impact on control over life was associated with lower overall mental HRQOL as well as lower HRQOL across all subscales except general health perceptions all p 0.05. In multivariable analyses perceived control and unmet information need were independently associated with HRQOL p-values for interaction 0.1. CONCLUSIONS Adolescent and young adult patients with cancer have high levels of unmet cancer-related information needs and perceived negative impact of cancer on control over life both were independently associated with lower HRQOL. Addressing unmet information needs among AYA cancer survivors and finding ways to increase their sense of control may help improve HRQOL in this understudied population.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are to assess current management algorithms for left ventricular LV hemodynamic and diastolic changes following atrial septal device occlusion in adult patients. BACKGROUND Percutaneous closure is now routine for atrial septal defects ASDs. Previous studies show ventricular size normalization following percutaneous closure. Case reports have discussed the incidence of early LV dysfunction following ASD device placement with some recommending delay of closure or placement of a fenestrated device in patients with elevated LV pressures. METHOD All adult patients with an isolated secundum ASD who underwent percutaneous repair were included in this study. In addition to placement of the Amplatzer septal occluder all patients had a pre and postprocedure transthoracic echocardiography performed measuring myocardial performance index MPI. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure LVEDP was measured before and after balloon occlusion. RESULTS Nineteen patients 17 female and two male were included in this study. Average age was 47.2 years 12.7 years. All defects were of clinical significance with average Qp Qs 2.0 0.6. Balloon occlusion led to a significant P .01 increase in LVEDP pre-LVEDP mean 7.1 mm Hg post-LVEDP mean 15.3 mm Hg. There was no significant change in MPI. ASD device size displayed a modest correlation relative to the change in LVEDP R 0.42 P .09. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous ASD closure induces an increase in LVEDP. Despite this all patients tolerated device closure without complication. It appears safe to close ASDs in these patients.",

For the isotropic model Delta 1 we show that all ground states are translation invariant. For the proof of these statements we propose a strategy for demonstrating completeness of the list of the pure infinite-volume ground states of a quantum many-body system of which the present results for the XXX and XXZ chains can be seen as an example. The result for Delta1 can also be proved by an easy extension to general S of the method used in T. Matsui Lett. Math. Phys. 37 1996 397 for the spin-12 ferromagnetic XXZ chain with Delta1. However our proof is different and does not rely on the existence of a spectral gap. In particular it also works to prove absence of non-translationally invariant ground states for the isotropic chains Delta1 which have a gapless excitation spectrum. Our results show that while any small amount of the anisotropy is enough to stabilize the domain walls against the quantum fluctuations no boundary condition exists that would stabilize a domain wall in the isotropic model Delta1.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In adult correctional facilities correctional officers COs are responsible for the safety and security of the facility in addition to aiding in offender rehabilitation and preventing recidivism. COs experience higher rates of job stress and burnout that stem from organizational stressors leading to negative outcomes for not only the CO but the organization as well. Effective interventions could aim at targeting organizational stressors in order to reduce these negative outcomes as well as COs job stress and burnout. This paper fills a gap in the organizational stress literature among COs by systematically reviewing the relationship between organizational stressors and CO stress and burnout in adult correctional facilities. In doing so the present review identifies areas that organizational interventions can target in order to reduce CO job stress and burnout. METHODS A systematic search of the literature was conducted using Medline PsycINFO Criminal Justice Abstracts and Sociological Abstracts. All retrieved articles were independently screened based on criteria developed a priori. All included articles underwent quality assessment. Organizational stressors were categorized according to Cooper and Marshalls 1976 model of job stress. RESULTS The systematic review yielded 8 studies that met all inclusion and quality assessment criteria. The five categories of organizational stressors among correctional officers are stressors intrinsic to the job role in the organization rewards at work supervisory relationships at work and the organizational structure and climate. The organizational structure and climate was demonstrated to have the most consistent relationship with CO job stress and burnout. CONCLUSIONS The results of this review indicate that the organizational structure and climate of correctional institutions has the most consistent relationship with COs job stress and burnout. Limitations of the studies reviewed include the cross-sectional design and the use of varying measures for organizational stressors. The results of this review indicate that interventions should aim to improve the organizational structure and climate of the correctional facility by improving communication between management and COs.",

As these femtocells can be deployed in an ad hoc manner by different consumers in the same frequency band the femtocells can interfere with each other. To fully realize the potential of the femtocells it is necessary to allocate resources to them in such a way that interference is mitigated. We propose a distributed resource allocation algorithm for femtocell networks that is modelled after link-state routing protocols. Resource allocation using Link State Propagation RALP consists of a graph formation stage where individual femtocells build a view of the network an allocation stage where every femtocell executes an algorithm to assign OFDMA resources to all the femtocells in the network and local scheduling stage where a femtocell assigns resources to all user equipments based on their throughput requirements. Our evaluation shows that RALP performs better than existing femtocell resource allocation algorithms with respect to spatial reuse and satisfaction rate of required throughput. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

METHOD A total of 498 participants were recruited from the community and from memory clinics into a multicenter longitudinal study of subcortical ischemic vascular disease. For baseline cognitive status 36 of participants were assessed as cognitively intact 31 as cognitively impaired and 33 as demented. All participants underwent a research protocol MRI and 41 were classified as having subcortical lacunes. Depressed mood anhedonia anergia and apathy were assessed at baseline using a structured behavioral assessment. Cox regression models were used to investigate the associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms and mortality controlling for age gender race education level cognitive status presence of vascular lacunes and vascular risk factors. RESULTS Of 498 participants 175 35 died over the follow-up period with a median survival time of 5.6 years. In the multivariate analyses cognitive impairment age male gender depressed mood and the presence of lacunes predicted higher mortality. Participants with both lacunes and depressed mood had the shortest survival among all cognitive groups. The mortality hazard ratio for participants with depressed mood was 2.2 95 CI1.5-3.2 after adjustment for cognitive status age gender education level race lacunes and all vascular conditions. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest the importance of detecting depressed mood in individuals with cerebrovascular disease and of developing more aggressive treatment and preventive interventions for this vulnerable population.",

Nine ticks identified as Otobius megnini were collected from two coyotes Canis latrans and 30 Alveonasus cooleyi McIvor 1941 were collected from six bobcats Lynx rufus and one rabbit Sylvilagus auduboni. We detected Rickettsia spp. DNA in 21 of the 27 77.8 tested Av. cooleyi and none of the O. megnini. No ticks were PCR-positive for borreliae and all mammals were PCR-negative for both pathogen genera. Phylogenetic analysis based on gltA htrA and 16 S rRNA targets revealed that all rickettsiae from Av. cooleyi clustered with ancestral group rickettsiae likely representing a novel species of possibly endosymbiotic Rickettsia. The significance of Av. cooleyi and the newly identified Rickettsia sp. to the health of wildlife is unknown and further work is indicated to determine whether they may be relevant to public health or carnivore conservation.",

In this study we examined the phylogenetic effects on hosts differentially affected by an emergent generalist beetle-pathogen complex in California and South Africa. Host types non-competent competent and killed-competent are based on nested types of outcomes of interactions between host plants the beetles and the fungal pathogens. Phylogenetic dispersion analysis of each host type revealed that the phylogenetic preferences of beetle attack and fungal growth were a nonrandom subset of all available tree and shrub species. Competent hosts were phylogenetically narrower by 62 Myr than the set of all potential hosts and those with devastating impacts were the most constrained by 107 Myr. Our results show a strong phylogenetic signal in the relative effects of a generalist pest-pathogen complex on host species demonstrating that the strength of multi-host pest impacts in plants can be predicted by host evolutionary relationships. This study presents a unifying theoretical approach to identifying likely disease outcomes across multiple host-pest combinations.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study assessed the effects of a community outreach and education model implemented as part of the Early Detection Intervention and Prevention of Psychosis Program EDIPPP a national multisite study in six U.S. regions. METHODS EDIPPPs model was designed to generate rapid referrals of youths at clinical high risk of psychosis by creating a network of professionals and community members trained to identify signs of early psychosis. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered through an evaluation of outreach efforts at five sites over a two-year period and through interviews with staff at all six sites. All outreach activities to groups educational medical and mental health professionals community groups media youth and parent groups and multicultural communities were counted for the six sites to determine correlations with total referrals and enrollments. RESULTS During the study period May 2007-May 2010 848 formal presentations were made to 22840 attendees and 145 informal presentations were made to 11528 attendees at all six sites. These presentations led to 1652 phone referrals. A total of 520 31 of these individuals were offered in-person orientation and 392 75 of those were assessed for eligibility. A total of 337 individuals 86 of those assessed met criteria for assignment to the EDIPPP study. CONCLUSIONS EDIPPPs outreach and education model demonstrated the effectiveness of following a protocol-defined outreach strategy combined with flexibility to reach culturally diverse audiences or initially inaccessible systems. All EDIPPP sites yielded appropriate referrals of youths at risk of psychosis.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS We accessed the National Readmission Database to identify CIED implantation-related hospitalizations between January 1 2010 and December 31 2014 using International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification procedure codes. In-hospital mortality and postprocedure all-cause 30-day readmissions were also analyzed. RESULTS During the study period a total of 800250 CIED implantation hospitalizations were identified across the United States with an in-hospital mortality rate of 0.9 7423 of 800250 and a 29 decrease in CIED-related index hospitalizations 188086 in 2010 vs 134276 in 2014. The all-cause 30-day readmission rate for the entire cohort was 13 106505 of 800250 decreasing from 14 26134 of 188085 in 2010 to only 13 17154 of 134276 by 2014. Dual-chamber pacemakers were the most frequently implanted in-hospital CIEDs 473615 of 800250 59. The most common cause for readmission was heart failure exacerbation which remained unchanged over the study period. CONCLUSION Our data reveal a steady decline in overall in-hospital CIED implantations and only a modest decline in readmission rates. The cause for this decline may be an impact of medical and regulatory changes guiding CIED implantations but it deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Severity of burning can influence multiple aspects of forest composition carbon cycling and climate forcing. We quantified how burn severity affected vegetation recovery and albedo change during early succession in Canadian boreal regions by combining satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS and the Canadian Large Fire Database. We used the MODIS-derived difference Normalized Burn Ratio dNBR and initial changes in spring albedo as measures of burn severity. We found that the most severe burns had the greatest reduction in summer MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index EVI in the first year after fire indicating greater loss of vegetation cover. By 5-8years after fire summer EVI for all severity classes had recovered to within 90-108 of prefire levels. Spring and summer albedo progressively increased during the first 7years after fire with more severely burned areas showing considerably larger postfire albedo increases during spring and more rapid increases during summer as compared with moderate- and low-severity burns. After 5-7years increases in spring albedo above prefire levels were considerably larger in high-severity burns 0.20 0.06 defined by dNBR percentiles greater than 75 as compared to changes observed in moderate- 0.16 0.06 for dNBR percentiles between 45 and 75 or low-severity burns 0.13 0.06 for dNBR percentiles between 20 and 45. The sensitivity of spring albedo to dNBR was similar in all ecozones and for all vegetation types along gradients of burn severity. These results suggest carbon losses associated with increases in burn severity observed in some areas of boreal forests may be at least partly offset in terms of climate impacts by increases in negative forcing associated with changes in surface albedo. 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspAbstract 3241jatsp jatspLeukemia cells are believed to arise from leukemia stem cells LSC. It is also known that LSC are responsible for relapse in certain types of leukemia such as acute myeloid leukemia AML. However the existence and role of LSC in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is unclear. CD9 was reported to be a marker for LSC in B-ALL using cell lines Nishida H. et al. 2009. CD9 is a tetraspanin and is believed to be involved in cell adhesion motility and signaling events. It is also involved in metastasis however the mechanisms are unknown. Since childhood ALL is a heterogeneous group of diseases and cell lines can be different from primary leukemia cells we tested the role of CD9 as a candidate LSC marker using primary precursor B preB ALL cells from pediatric patients. Two methods Raman spectroscopy and serial transplantation of sorted leukemia cells in NODSCIDIL2R g null NSG mice were used to confirm LSC. Raman spectroscopy is a laser-based technique for the single cell analysis of intrinsic molecular vibrations reflecting cellular biochemical information. It can provide a quantitative assessment of the levels of DNA RNA proteins lipids and carbohydrates in the cell as well as molecular-level conformational changes. Previous studies by our group showed that unique Raman fingerprints were identified in normal blood cells ALL cells and stem cells including hematopoietic stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Four preB ALL samples were stained for CD9 and sorted by flow cytometry. ALL samples were obtained from patients at diagnosis or freshly harvested from NSG mice engrafted with primary leukemia samples. All samples showed heterogeneous expression of CD9. CD9 high-positive cells and negative cells were flow sorted. Raman spectra of freshly sorted CD9 high-positive and negative cells were obtained. 10 to 20 cells were analyzed in each sample. CD34 positive cells which were isolated from normal donors were also analyzed by Raman spectroscopy as a control. No unique Raman fingerprints were identified to separate CD9 high-positive cells from negative cells using Principal Component Analysis PCA. Furthermore CD9 high-positive and negative cells from three preB ALL samples were transplanted into NSG mice via intra-bone marrow injection. Equal cell numbers 5105 to 1.5106 cells were used for positive and negative samples in each injection. The majority of the mice from both groups transplanted with CD9 high-positive or negative cells developed leukemia 3 to 4 months after injection. Leukemia phenotype was confirmed to be the same as the original leukemia. In conclusion although CD9 was shown to be a marker for LSC in B-ALL cell lines it does not appear to be an LSC marker in primary preB ALL. Since childhood preB ALL is a heterogeneous group of diseases larger cohorts are necessary to confirm our findings. Raman spectroscopy may be a useful screening tool for analysis of cellular intrinsic markers.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "In natural ecosystems plant communities composed of functionally diverse species produce more biomass overall than less diverse communities. This increased biomass production is thought to occur due to complementary use of resources such as nutrients and water and facilitation during sub-optimal environmental conditions. Using the same concept in a crop setting may lead to increased yield overyielding in diverse cropping systems when compared to monocultures. Different combinations of peanut watermelon okra cowpea and pepper planted alone or in various intercropping combinations were investigated over two growing seasons in a low-input system in the peak of summer heat in Texas. Each species was selected to perform a specific function within the system. Results from land equivalent ratio LER indicate that the within-row combination with peanut watermelon and okra Wpwo and peanut watermelon okra and cowpea Wpwoc consistently overyielded in 2011 and 2012. LER values were 1.17 each for Wpwo and Wpwoc in 2011 and 1.17 and 1.20 in 2012 respectively. In 2011 watermelon was the dominant crop and was up-regulated in all intercropping combinations while all other component crops were down-regulated. Watermelon per plant production was significantly higher in the combination containing all species Wall when compared to its monoculture 5.50 and 2.09kgfruitplant-1 respectively. In 2012 okra was the dominant crop and was up-regulated in all intercropping combinations while watermelon cowpea and pepper were down-regulated. Okra per plant production was significantly higher in Wpwoc and Wall than in monoculture 2.28 2.46 and 1.13kgfruitplant-1 respectively. These findings suggest that three and four species intercropping combinations whereby each crop is selected to perform a specific function within the system may provide small-scale sustainably-minded producers a model system that can be utilized in suboptimal conditions and allow them to reduce inputs while increasing overall yields.",

A total of 1571 ectoparasites in Mesostigmata Trombidiformes Siphonaptera and Ixodida were collected from 341 rodents Microtus californicus scirpensis Mus musculus Reithrodontomys megalotis Peromyscus eremicus and Neotoma lepida at eleven marshes. Trombiculids accounted for 82.5 of mites followed by the mesostigmatid Ornithonyssus bacoti 17.5 with chiggers predominating on voles and harvest mice. There were at least three genera of chiggers Eutrombicula alfreddugesi Euschoengastia sp. novel and Blankaartia sp. novel. Fleas included Orchopeas leucopus 90.3 of all fleas and O. sexdentatus 9.7 and ticks were the novel endemic Ixodes mojavensis 82.1 of ticks and Dermacentor similis 17.9. On all hosts and at all marshes coverage-based rarefaction sampling was over 96 indicating coverage sufficient for analysis. Dissimilarities in ectoparasite community structure were driven mainly by chiggers I. mojavensis and O. leucopus. Northern marshes were dominated by chiggers central marshes by I. mojavensis and southern marshes by O. leucopus. Primary determinants of ectoparasite community structure were host species patch size and parasite interspecific interactions. Host species richness and environmental factors such as patch distance and water and plant availability were not significantly associated with patterns of ectoparasitism. There were nine 60 significant negative pairwise associations between ectoparasite taxa and no significant positive relationships. Ixodes mojavensis had the highest number of negative associations with five other species followed by chiggers and O. bacoti with two negative associations each. The study area is among the most arid in North America and supports numerous rare and endemic species in increasingly isolated wetland habitat patches knowledge of ectoparasite ecology in this region identifies potential ectoparasite vectors and provides information needed to design and implement programs to manage vector-borne diseases for purposes of wildlife conservation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Unnecessary diagnostic imaging leads to higher costs longer emergency department stays and increased patient exposure to ionizing radiation. We sought to prospectively derive and validate two decision instruments DIs for selective chest computed tomography CT in adult blunt trauma patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS From September 2011 to May 2014 we prospectively enrolled blunt trauma patients over 14 y of age presenting to eight US urban level 1 trauma centers in this observational study. During the derivation phase physicians recorded the presence or absence of 14 clinical criteria before viewing chest imaging results. We determined injury outcomes by CT radiology readings and categorized injuries as major or minor according to an expert-panel-derived clinical classification scheme. We then employed recursive partitioning to derive two DIs Chest CT-All maximized sensitivity for all injuries and Chest CT-Major maximized sensitivity for only major thoracic injuries while increasing specificity. In the validation phase we employed similar methodology to prospectively test the performance of both DIs. We enrolled 11477 patients-6002 patients in the derivation phase and 5475 patients in the validation phase. The derived Chest CT-All DI consisted of 1 abnormal chest X-ray 2 rapid deceleration mechanism 3 distracting injury 4 chest wall tenderness 5 sternal tenderness 6 thoracic spine tenderness and 7 scapular tenderness. The Chest CT-Major DI had the same criteria without rapid deceleration mechanism. In the validation phase Chest CT-All had a sensitivity of 99.2 95 CI 95.4-100 a specificity of 20.8 95 CI 19.2-22.4 and a negative predictive value NPV of 99.8 95 CI 98.9-100 for major injury and a sensitivity of 95.4 95 CI 93.6-96.9 a specificity of 25.5 95 CI 23.5-27.5 and a NPV of 93.9 95 CI 91.5-95.8 for either major or minor injury. Chest CT-Major had a sensitivity of 99.2 95 CI 95.4-100 a specificity of 31.7 95 CI 29.9-33.5 and a NPV of 99.9 95 CI 99.3-100 for major injury and a sensitivity of 90.7 95 CI 88.3-92.8 a specificity of 37.9 95 CI 35.8-40.1 and a NPV of 91.8 95 CI 89.7-93.6 for either major or minor injury. Regarding the limitations of our work some clinicians may disagree with our injury classification and sensitivity thresholds for injury detection. CONCLUSIONS We prospectively derived and validated two DIs Chest CT-All and Chest CT-Major that identify blunt trauma patients with clinically significant thoracic injuries with high sensitivity allowing for a safe reduction of approximately 25-37 of unnecessary chest CTs. Trauma evaluation protocols that incorporate these DIs may decrease unnecessary costs and radiation exposure in the disproportionately young trauma population.",

    "abstract": "Two principal methods of determining the conformation of short pieces of polypeptide backbone in proteins have been developed using a database of known structures and systematically generating all conformations. In this paper we compare the effectiveness of these two techniques. The completeness of the database for segments of different lengths is examined and it is found to contain most conformations for segments seven residues long but to deteriorate rapidly for longer regions. When the database segment is to be incorporated into the rest of a structure at least seven residues are required to build four new residues because of the need to position the segment relative to the rest of the structure. It is found that such positioning using flanking residues results in large errors in the inserted region. We conclude that the database method is currently not effective for comparative modeling even for short segments. The systematic search procedure is found to generate almost all structures of short segments found in proteins. In contrast to the database method low root mean square error structures are obtained for a set of trial segments embedded in the rest of a protein structure. Thus it should be considered the method of choice.",

We wondered whether it is possible to achieve rotational forces sufficient to cause SBS-like injuries in children 2 years of age. The present study describes cases of child abuse in older children who presented with the classic ophthalmologic and intracranial findings of SBS. In this case series 4 cases of older children 2.5-7 years old 11.8-22 kg who died from abusive head injuries and who had diffuse retinal hemorrhages identified antemortem were selected for review. The cases were abstracted from hospital charts records from autopsies coroners and district attorneys offices and court transcripts. In all 4 cases the history provided by the primary caregiver did not match the severity of the injuries. Three case subjects presented with patterned bruises. Multilayered retinal hemorrhages and acute subdural hematoma were observed in all 4 cases. At autopsy diffuse axonal injury was evident in 3 of the 4 cases all 4 cases had optic nerve sheath hemorrhages. None of the victims had skeletal fractures on radiologic examination or at autopsy. This case series demonstrates that it is possible to observe SBS-like retinal and central nervous system findings in the older and heavier child. Our findings underscore the need for providers to consider intentional shaking as a mechanism of injury in the evaluation of abusive head injury in older children.",

We review the clinical signs of disease diagnostic findings and results of surgical and medical treatments of brainstem disease attributable to otogenic intracranial infection in cats and dogs. Eleven cats and 4 dogs were examined because of acute subacute or chronic clinical signs of brain disease including central vestibular signs altered mentation abnormal posturegait cranial nerve deficits and seizures. Results of a minimal database CBC serum biochemical panel urinalysis thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasonographic images or radiographs were within reference intervals in all animals. Magnetic resonance MR images of the head were acquired for all animals and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid CSF from 9 of 11 cats and 3 of 4 dogs was examined. Surgical exploration and ventral bulla osteotomy were done for 12 of 15 animals followed by 1-3 months of antibiotic therapy the remaining animals were euthanized before treatment. In all animals MR imaging was effective in characterizing the location and extent of the pathologic changes intracranially as well as within middleinner ear structures. Results of CSF analysis were characteristic of bacterial infection in most of the animals with acute or subacute disease. Since long-term outcome in all treated animals was very good to excellent it was concluded that dogs and cats with intracranial disease secondary to extension of otitis mediainterna have a good-to-excellent prognosis when the condition was diagnosed and was treated by surgical exploration and appropriate antibiotic therapy.",

Here we show i the emergence of resistance-breaking RB TSWV strains in processing and fresh market tomato production in California over the past ten years and ii evolutionary relationships with RB strains from other areas. A specific RT-PCR test was used to show the C118Y RB strain that emerged in Fresno County in 2016 quickly became predominant in the central production area and remained so through this study. In 2021 the C118Y strain was detected in the Northern production area and was predominant in 2022. However in 2023 the C118Y strain was unexpectedly detected in fewer spotted wilt samples from resistant varieties. This was due to emergence of the T120N RB strain previously known to occur in Spain. A specific RT-PCR test was developed and used to show that the T120N RB strain was predominant in Colusa and Sutter counties detected in 75-80 of samples and detected in 50 of samples from Yolo County. Pathogenicity tests confirmed California isolates of the T120N strain infected Sw-5b tomato varieties and induced severe symptoms. Another RB strain C118F was associated with spotted wilt samples of Sw-5 varieties from fresh market tomato production in southern California. Phylogenetic analyses with complete NSm sequences revealed that the C118Y and T120N RB strains infecting resistant processing tomato in California emerged locally whereas those from fresh market production were more closely related to isolates from Mexico. Thus widespread deployment of this single dominant resistance gene in California has driven the local emergence of multiple RB strains in different tomato production areas and types. These results further emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring for RB strains and identification of sources of resistance to these strains.",

In both conditions participants studied eight lists of semantic associates and free recall was tested after the presentation of each list. In the Standard condition recognition was tested after the presentation of all the lists whereas in the Proximal condition patients were administered a six-item recognition task after the presentation of each list. Participants also provided remember or know judgements and described the content of their recollections. All groups of patients recalled a lower proportion of targets and critical lures than did control subjects but confabulators recalled more words unrelated to the studied lists than did NF amnesics and controls. All groups of participants improved true recognition across conditions. However whereas normal controls suppressed false recognition to critical lures in the Proximal compared to the Standard condition and non-confabulating amnesics showed comparable gist-based false recognition confabulators showed increased levels of false recognition to critical lures across conditions. Furthermore NF amnesics significantly reduced false recognition to unrelated lures in the Proximal compared to the Standard condition whereas confabulators were unable to suppress false recognition to unrelated lures across conditions. Analysis of the phenomenological experience showed that unlike non-confabulating amnesics confabulators characterized true and false memories with irrelevant information related to test items. Results are interpreted in light of confabulators monitoring deficits.",

    "abstract": "Local government services are increasingly being provided in fragmented polycentric systems where the overlapping jurisdictions draw resources from the same fiscal base. Developing optimal policies for the efficient management of fiscal resources requires a consideration of the total underlying fiscal pool. In this study we evaluate the impact that special purpose districts have on debt ratios at the county common pool level in the State of Georgia U.S. between 2005 and 2014. Empirical findings suggest that inclusion of all general government and special purpose debt for each county may at times result in a greater burden on fiscal common pool than existing rules permit. These results call into question the efficacy of fiscal policies in a polycentric governance system that neglect to account for debt levels for all actors within the confines of a single fiscal common pool unit. Results also show that total debt ratios are significantly affected by special districts that operate within boundaries of a single county. We find no evidence that independent special districts have a differential impact on fiscal common pools compared to their dependent counterparts.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of the extraordinary inflation mechanism of pufferfishes was studied in the light of an independently derived phylogenetic hypothesis of tetraodontiform fishes. Inflation behavior is found in all members of the puffer sister taxa Tetraodontidae and Diodontidae. However most other tetraodontiform fishes exhibit two functionally similar behaviors. All taxa exhibit a coughing behavior and with the exception of the sister-group to all other tetraodontiforms represented by the Triacanthidae all lineages blow strong jets of water out of their mouth to excavate prey. Functional specializations associated with the three behaviors were identified from anatomical analyses and electromyographic recordings of muscle activity in representatives of the major lineages of the order. The phylogenetic distribution of the three buccal compression behaviors and their functional bases indicates the following 1 the evolution of inflation behavior involved major structural modifications of the head that function in a novel mechanism that links depression of the floor of the mouth to posterior expansion of the buccal cavity 2 the contraction patterns of four key head muscles used in the three behaviors are generally similar both across behaviors and taxa 3 however the distribution of the two significant modifications of muscle activity are consistent with the hypothesis that the three behaviors represent a transformation series from coughing to water blowing to inflation. The motor pattern for water blowing is a slightly modified version of that seen in coughing and the inflation motor pattern retains the blowing specialization and adds a single additional modification. The convergent evolution of a poorly developed inflation behavior in at least one genus of filefish provides evidence that tetraodontiform fishes are predisposed to the evolution of this unusual defensive behavior. The presence of a well developed water-blowing behavior in most tetraodontiform lineages may represent an intermediate functional specialization that increased the probability of the evolution of inflation.",

We conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of 189 patients with relapsedrefractory ALL treated with brexu-cel. Over half of the patients received InO before brexu-cel InO exposed. InO-exposed patients were more heavily pretreated P .02 and frequently had active marrow disease before apheresis P .03. Response rate and toxicity profile after brexu-cel were comparable for InO-exposed and InO-nave patients however consolidation therapy after brexu-cel response was used at a higher rate in InO-nave patients P .005. With a median follow-up of 11.4 months InO-exposed patients had inferior progression-free survival PFS P .013 and overall survival OS P .006 in univariate analyses however prior InO exposure did not influence PFS hazard ratio 1.20 95 confidence interval 0.71-2.03 in multivariate models. Within InO-exposed patients InO responders had superior PFS P .002 and OS P .0001 relative to InO-refractory patients. The timing of administering InO did not affect brexu-cel outcomes with comparable PFS P .51 and OS P .86 for patients receiving InO as bridging therapy or before apheresis. In conclusion although InO exposure was associated with inferior survival outcomes after brexu-cel in unadjusted analyses these associations were no longer significant in multivariate analyses suggesting it is unlikely that InO negatively affects brexu-cel efficacy. Our data instead imply that InO-exposed recipients of brexu-cel tend to be higher-risk patients with intrinsic adverse leukemia biology.",

CLINICAL FINDINGS Dogs between 11 and 13 years of age weighing between 13.7 and 43.8 kg had either a renal mass n 2 or a mass located in the caudodorsal aspect of the retroperitoneal space near the right side of the diaphragm 1. Cytology revealed that one of the renal masses and the mass located near the diaphragm were malignant neoplasias. Findings on cytologic evaluation of a sample of the other renal mass was nondiagnostic. Maximum mass diameters ranged between 1.4 and 2.5 cm. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME All dogs were treated by percutaneous MWA. Probes were directed into tumors by use of ultrasound and CT guidance and microwave energy was applied to each mass. Findings on imaging of each mass following MWA was consistent with successful treatment. No intraprocedural or major postprocedural complications occurred and all dogs were discharged from the hospital within 3 days of treatment. Two dogs died at 3 and 21 months after MWA with no known local recurrence 1 dog was still alive 64 months after treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Although the indications for MWA in the treatment of neoplasia in companion animals are limited the outcomes of dogs in the present report provided preliminary evidence that percutaneous MWA can be safely used to effectively treat retroperitoneal neoplasia. This procedure was successfully performed with image guidance in all 3 dogs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Donor human milk should be processed to guarantee microbiological safety prior to infant feeding but this process can influence the structure and quantity of functional proteins. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the effect of thawing homogenization vat-pasteurization Vat-PT retort sterilization RTR and ultra-high-temperature UHT processing on the structure of bioactive proteins in donor milk. METHODS Pooled donor milk was either not treated Raw or treated with an additional freeze-thaw cycle with and without homogenization Vat-PT RTR with and without homogenization and UHT processing with and without homogenization. Overall protein retention was assessed via sodium-dodecyl sulfate SDS-PAGE and the immunoreactivity of 13 bioactive proteins were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA. RESULTS Freeze-thawing freeze-thawing plus homogenization and Vat-PT preserved all the immunoglobulins sIgAIgA IgG IgM in donor milk whereas RTR and UHT degraded almost all immunoglobulins. UHT did not alter osteopontin immunoreactivity but Vat-PT and retort decreased it by 50 and 70 respectively. Freeze-thawing with homogenization Vat-PT and UHT reduced lactoferrins immunoreactivity by 35 65 and 84 respectively. Lysozyme survived unaltered throughout all processing conditions. In contrast elastase immunoreactivity was decreased by all methods except freeze-thawing. Freeze-thawing freeze-thawing plus homogenization and Vat-PT did not alter polymeric immunoglobulin receptor PIGR immunoreactivity but RTR RTR plus homogenization and UHT increased detection. All heat processing methods increased -lactalbumin immunoreactivity. Vat-PT preserved all the growth factors vascularendothelial growth factor and transforming growth factors 1 and 2 and UHT treatments preserved the majority of these factors. CONCLUSION Different bioactive proteins have different sensitivity to the treatments tested. Overall Vat-PT preserved more of the bioactive proteins compared with UHT or RTR. Therefore human milk processors should consider the impact of processing methods on key bioactive proteins in human milk.",

    "abstract": "The paradox of upwelling is the relationship between strong wind forcing nutrient enrichment and shelf productivity. Here we investigate how across-shelf structure in velocity and hydrography plays a role in the retention inshore and export offshore of particles such as nutrients plankton and larvae. We examine the spatial structure of the coastal currents during wind-driven upwelling and relaxation on the northern Californian Shelf. The field work was conducted as part of the Wind Events and Shelf Transport WEST project a 5-year NSFCoOP-funded study of the role of wind-driven transport in shelf productivity off Bodega Bay northern California from 2000 to 2003. We combine shipboard velocity profiles ADCP and water properties from hydrographic surveys during the upwelling season to examine the mean across-shelf structure of the hydrography and velocity fields during three contrasting upwelling seasons and throughout the upwelling-relaxation cycle. We also present results from two winter seasons that serve as contrast to the upwelling seasons. During all three upwelling seasons clear spatial structure is evident in velocity and hydrography across the shelf exemplified by current reversals inshore and the presence of a persistent upwelling jet at the shelf break. This jet feature changes in structure and distance from the coast under different wind forcing regimes. The jet also changes from the north of our region where it is a single narrow jet adjacent to the coast and to the south of our region where it broadens and at times two jets become evident. We present observations of the California Under Current which was observed at the outer edge of our domain during all three upwelling seasons. The observed across-shelf structure could aid both in the retention of plankton inshore during periods of upwelling followed by relaxation and in the export of plankton offshore in the upwelling jet. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the cardiopulmonary effects of increasing doses of dopamine dobutamine epinephrine and phenylephrine and measure plasma concentrations of norepinephrine epinephrine and dopamine in cats anesthetized with isoflurane. ANIMALS 6 healthy adult cats. PROCEDURES Each cat was anesthetized with isoflurane 1.5 X minimum alveolar concentration on 4 occasions. Cardiopulmonary measurements were obtained after a 30-minute stabilization period 20 minutes after the start of each infusion dose and 30 60 and 90 minutes after the infusion was discontinued. Cats received 5 progressively increasing infusions of epinephrine or phenylephrine 0.125 0.25 0.5 1 and 2 microgkgmin or dobutamine or dopamine 2.5 5 10 15 and 20 microgkgmin. The order of treatment was randomly allocated. Results-All 4 treatments increased oxygen delivery. Heart rate HR increased during administration of all drugs except phenylephrine and mean arterial pressure increased during administration of all drugs except dobutamine. A progressive metabolic acidosis was detected but whole-blood lactate concentration only increased during administration of epinephrine and dobutamine. Systemic vascular resistance index increased during administration of phenylephrine decreased during administration of dobutamine and remained unchanged during administration of dopamine and epinephrine. A positive inotropic effect was detected with all treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE During anesthesia in cats administration of dopamine dobutamine and epinephrine may be useful for increasing cardiac output with dopamine having the most useful effects. Administration of phenylephrine increased cardiac and systemic vascular resistance indexes with minimal effect on HR and may be useful for increasing mean arterial pressure without increasing HR.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To compare the diagnostic performance of the traditional approach to acid-base analysis with the Stewart approach and a semiquantitative approach. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING University teaching hospital. ANIMALS A total number of 84 dogs and 14 cats presenting to a university teaching hospital emergency room. PROCEDURES All dogs and cats in which venous blood samples for acid-base lactate and serum biochemical analysis were all collected within 60 minutes of each other over a 5-month enrollment period. Acid-base analysis was performed using the traditional approach Stewart approach and a semiquantitative approach. RESULTS Traditional acid-base analysis identified respiratory acid-base abnormalities in 1498 animals and metabolic acid-base abnormalities in 6798. A mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis was most common occurring in 2998 patients. The Stewart approach identified metabolic abnormalities in 8298 patients strong ion difference abnormalities were evident in 6898 cases an increased strong ion gap acidosis was identified in 4998 cases and changes in the quantity of weak acids in 2598 cases. The semiquantitative approach identified abnormalities in all cases evaluated. Of the 14 patients with a primary respiratory acid-base abnormality the Stewart approach identified metabolic abnormalities in 9 and the semiquantitative approach found abnormalities in all animals. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The physicochemical approaches diagnosed more acid-base abnormalities in this population than the traditional approach although many of the abnormalities identified were small and of unknown clinical relevance. The physicochemical approaches may provide greater insight as to the underlying etiology of abnormalities which maybe of particular relevance to cases with changes in albumin andor phosphorus concentration.",

While assistance from trained bioethicists may be obtained via telephone or email such methods of contact do not allow a bioethicist to engage fully with all members of the health-care team the patient and family members. In two recent cases rural hospitals contacted our centre for assistance with complex ethics cases. We provided a clinical ethics consultation via videoconferencing. The outcomes of the consultations would probably have been inferior had they been performed via telephone. For example the non-verbal cues allowed the consultants to have a better understanding of the team dynamics and led them to ask important questions that directly affected the recommendations which were made. Because patients are likely to benefit significantly from access to bioethicists when ethical questions arise rural and community hospitals should consider teleconsultation when local ethics committees decide that further assistance is warranted.",

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. METHODS Hip radiographs from 7 breeds of dogs were randomly selected from a database. None of the dogs had radiographic evidence of degenerative joint disease DJD. Distraction index DI and Norberg angle NA were measured on these radiographs and compared with DI and NA thresholds for diagnosing DJD susceptibility derived from the literature and from evaluated Borzois. Dogs with a NA105 degrees and a DI of or 0.32 were considered false-positives and dogs with a NA or 105 degrees and a DI of 0.32 were considered false-negatives. RESULTS Mean age of all dogs was 22.9 months. Mean NA for all dogs was 99.37 degrees and mean DI for all dogs was 0.44. Borzoi mean DI of was significantly less than the mean DI of the other 6 breeds. The highest most hip laxity Borzoi DI was 0.32 and the lowest most hip laxity Borzoi NA was 99 degrees. False-positive and false-negative diagnoses were identified in 6 of the 7 breeds. CONCLUSIONS Using the NA threshold of 105 degrees literature established threshold of susceptibility to DJD resulted in a high percentage of false-negative and false-positive diagnoses. Breeds like the Labrador Retriever and Rottweiler would have large numbers of hip dysplasia susceptible dogs remain in the breeding population based on this NA threshold. False-positive diagnoses were common in breeds like the Australian Shepherd Borzoi and German Shepherd effectively eliminating hip dysplasia nonsusceptible dogs from the breeding population. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The NA was not an accurate predictor of DJD susceptibility in these 7 breeds of dogs when using a NA threshold of 105 degrees.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The current guidelines recommend weight loss for patients with overweight or obesity and knee or hip osteoarthritis OA however there is a paucity of data on the relation of weight loss to death among patients with OA. We aimed to examine the relation of the rate of weight loss induced by antiobesity medications over one year to all-cause mortality among patients with overweight or obesity and knee or hip OA. METHODS Using the IQVIA Medical Research Database we identified people with overweight or obesity and knee or hip OA. We emulated analyses of a hypothetical target trial to assess the effect of slow-to-moderate 2-10 or fast 10 weight loss induced by the initiation of antiobesity medications within one year on all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes over five years follow-up. RESULTS Among 6524 participants the five-year all-cause mortality rates were 5.3 4.0 and 5.4 for weight gain or stable slow-to-moderate weight loss and fast weight loss arms respectively. Compared with the weight gain or stable arm hazard ratios of all-cause mortality were 0.72 95 confidence interval CI 0.56-0.92 for the slow-to-moderate weight loss arm and 0.99 95 CI 0.67-1.44 for the fast weight loss arm. We found dose-response protective effects of weight loss on incident hypertension type 2 diabetes and venous thromboembolism but a slightly higher risk of cardiovascular disease albeit not statistically significant in the fast rate of weight loss arm than in the weight gain or stable arm and no significant relations of weight loss to the risk of cancer. CONCLUSION In this population-based study a slow-to-moderate but not fast rate of weight loss induced by antiobesity medications is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in people with overweight or obesity and knee or hip OA.",

DESIGN Longitudinal archival study comparing individuals who became demented during follow-up and people who remained nondemented on each of 4 cognitive factors global verbal memory visuospatial and working memory. SETTING Alzheimer Disease Research Center Washington University School of Medicine St Louis Missouri. PARTICIPANTS One hundred thirty-four individuals who became demented during follow-up and 310 who remained nondemented. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Inflection point in longitudinal cognitive performance. RESULTS The best-fitting model for each of the 4 factors in the stable group was linear with a very slight downward trend on all but the Visuospatial factor. In contrast a piecewise model with accelerated slope after a sharp inflection point provided the best fit for the group that progressed. The optimal inflection point for all 4 factors was prior to diagnosis of dementia Global 2 years Verbal and Working Memory 1 year and Visuospatial 3 years. These results were also obtained when data were limited to the subset n 44 with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease. CONCLUSIONS There is a sharp inflection point followed by accelerating decline in multiple domains of cognition not just memory in the preclinical period in Alzheimer disease when there is insufficient cognitive decline to warrant clinical diagnosis using conventional criteria. Early change was seen in tests of visuospatial ability most of which were speeded. Research into early detection of cognitive disorders using only episodic memory tasks may not be sensitive to all of the early manifestations of disease.",

A series of end-to-end phantom tests were performed TrueBeam-based image guided radiation therapy IGRT to determine the geometric accuracy of the image-guided setup and dose delivery process for all beam modalities delivered using intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT and RapidArc. In these tests an anthropomorphic phantom with a Ball Cube II insert and the analysis software FilmQA 3cognition were used to evaluate the accuracy of TrueBeam image-guided setup and dose delivery. Laser cut EBT2 films with 0.15 mm accuracy were embedded into the phantom. The phantom with the film inserted was first scanned with a GE Discovery-ST CT scanner and the images were then imported to the planning system. Plans with steep dose fall off surrounding hypothetical targets of different sizes were created using RapidArc and IMRT with FFF and WFF with flattening filter beams. Four RapidArc plans 6 MV and 10 MV FFF and five IMRT plans 6 MV and 10 MV FFF 6 MV 10 MV and 15 MV WFF were studied. The RapidArc plans with 6 MV FFF were planned with target diameters of 1 cm 0.52 cc 2 cm 4.2 cc and 3 cm 14.1 cc and all other plans with a target diameter of 3 cm. Both onboard planar and volumetric imaging procedures were used for phantom setup and target localization. The IMRT and RapidArc plans were then delivered and the film measurements were compared with the original treatment plans using a gamma criteria of 31 mm and 32 mm. The shifts required in order to align the film measured dose with the calculated dose distributions was attributed to be the targeting error. Targeting accuracy of image-guided treatment using TrueBeam was found to be within 1 mm. For irradiation of the 3 cm target the gammas 3 1 mm were found to be above 90 in all plan deliveries. For irradiations of smaller targets 2 cm and 1 cm similar accuracy was achieved for 6 MV and 10 MV beams. Slightly degraded accuracy was observed for irradiations with higher energy beam 15 MV. In general gammas 3 2 mm were found to be above 97 for all the plans. Our end-to-end tests showed an excellent relative dosimetric agreement and sub-millimeter targeting accuracy for 6 MV and 10 MV beams using both FFF and WFF delivery methods. However increased deviations in spatial and dosimetric accuracy were found when treating lesions smaller than 2 cm or with 15 MV beam.",

Both types of cognition are considered important in everyday functioning but are thought to be differently affected by brain health status throughout life from early childhood through older adulthood. All three Toolbox composite scores showed excellent test-retest reliability robust developmental effects across the childhood age range considered here and strong correlations with established measures of similar abilities. Additional preliminary evidence of validity includes significant associations between all three Toolbox composite scores and maternal reports of childrens health status and school performance.",

    "abstract": "Seed dispersal is a fundamental life history trait in plants. Although the recent surge of interest in seed dispersal by ants myrmecochory has added greatly to knowledge on the ecology of seed dispersal and ant-plant mutualisms myrmecochory also represents a unique opportunity to examine the links between seed dispersal and evolution in flowering plants. Here we review the taxonomic phylogenetic and biogeographic distribution of myrmecochory in flowering plants. Myrmecochory is mediated by elaiosomes i.e. lipid-rich seed appendages that attract ants and serve as rewards for dispersal. We surveyed the literature for evidence of elaiosomes in angiosperm plants to estimate the global prevalence of myrmecochory. We then searched the literature for phylogenetic reconstructions to identify myrmecochorous lineages and to estimate the minimum number of independent evolutionary origins of myrmecochory. We found that myrmecochory is present in at least 11 000 species or 4.5 of all species in 334 genera or 2.5 of all genera and in 77 families or 17 of all families of angiosperm plants. We identified at least 101 but possibly up to 147 independent origins of myrmecochory. We estimated three or more origins in 13 families and found that at least half the genera are myrmecochorous in 10 families. Most myrmecochorous lineages were Australian South African or northern temperate Holarctic. A mapping of families containing myrmecochorous genera on a dated angiosperm supertree showed that myrmecochory has evolved in most of the major angiosperm lineages and that it is more frequent in younger families crown group age 80 million years than in older ones. We suggest that the relatively low physiological and energetic costs of producing an elaiosome and the consistent selective benefits of myrmecochory dispersal protection from seed predators and fire safe and nutrient-rich microsites explain the numerous evolutionary and developmental origins of myrmecochory in angiosperm plants and we propose that elaiosomes thus provide one of the most dramatic examples of convergent evolution in biology. 2009 Rbel Foundation ETH Zrich.",

Global soil change raises important questions about the future of soil the environment and human society. Although many soil scientists strive to understand human forcings as integral to soil genesis there remains an explicit need for a science of anthropedology to detail how humanity is a fully fledged soil-forming factor and to understand how soil change affects human well being. The development and maturation of anthropedology is critical to achieving land-use sustainability and needs to be nurtured by all soil disciplines with inputs from allied sciences and the humanities. The Soil Science Society of America SSSA has recently approved a cross-divisional Working Group on Soil Change which aims to advance the basic and applied science of anthropedology to facilitate networks of scientists long-term soil field studies and regional databases and modeling and to engage in new modes of communications about human-soil relations. We challenge all interested parties especially young scientists and students to contribute to these activities and help grow soil science in the Anthropocene.

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspBackgroundjatsp jatspPonatinib a third-generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI hyper-CVAD showed remarkable activity against Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ph ALL and may be superior to chemotherapy earlier generation TKIs in terms of depth of remission event-free survival EFS and overall survival OS. However this regimens efficacy and tolerability have yet to be externally validated. Here we summarize our real-world experience with ponatinib hyper-CVAD for untreated Ph ALL and other Ph acute or blast phase leukemias.jatsp jatspMethodsjatsp jatspWe retrospectively analyzed all adults treated at the University of California Davis UCD from March 2012 to May 2021 with ponatinib hyper-CVAD upfront. The primary endpoints were 3-year OS and EFS. Secondary endpoints were complete molecular response CMR measurable residual disease MRD negativity by multiparameter flow cytometry MFC complete cytogenetic response CCyR rates and adverse events AEs. Time to event analyses were done via the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients alive were censored at their last follow-up date. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant HCT after 6 months of achieving complete remission CR were censored at the time of HCT for the landmark analysis. Patients with missing data were excluded from the response analyses.jatsp jatspResultsjatsp jatspWe identified 13 Ph ALL patients who received ponatinib hyper-CVAD for initial induction. The baseline characteristics for the Ph ALL patients are summarized in Table 1. The median follow-up was 16 months. The median number of hyper-CVAD cycles completed was 8 range 1-8 with ponatinib. Two patients proceeded to HCT in CR1 one at 3.5 months after starting induction and due to difficulty controlling the patients concurrent multiple myeloma prior to HCT and recovery from anti-neoplastic therapy the second was delayed to 46 months after starting induction.jatsp jatspThe 3-year OS and EFS with ponatinib hyper-CVAD were each 92 95 confidence interval 78.9-100 Figure 1. Landmark analysis completed 6 months following CR showed a 3-year OS of 100 in patients treated with ponatinib hyper-CVAD without HCT in first CR CR1. The CMR CCyR and MRD-negativity by MFC rates with ponatinib were all 92.3 1213. The median time to CMR CCyR and MRD-negativity by MFC were 51 days 22 days and 53 days respectively.jatsp jatspNotable AEs with ponatinib include neutropenic fever 92 bacterial infection 69 transaminitis 38 venous thromboembolism 31 invasive fungal infection 15 hemorrhage 15 cerebrovascular accident CVA 15 and tumor lysis syndrome 8. One patient died during induction with ponatinib due to a bacterial infection. Two patients switched to a different TKI due to a CVA after 4 and 24 months. Only 2 patients did not complete 8 cycles of hyper-CVAD due to death during induction n1 and proceeding to HCT after 3 cycles n1.jatsp jatspAs for similar Ph leukemias 3 chronic myeloid leukemia with lymphoid blast crisis CML-LBC 1 CML with mixed phenotype blast crisis CML-MPBC and 1 with mixed phenotype acute leukemia MPAL were treated with ponatinib hyper-CVAD. The MPAL patient achieved CMR within 55 days while the CML-MPBC and 2 CML-LBC patients achieved CMR after HCT. The third CML-LBC patient is in CR with ongoing treatment. After median follow-up of 25 months all 5 were alive and only the MPAL patient relapsed 28 months after starting treatment and 1 year after HCT.jatsp jatspConclusionjatsp jatspTo our knowledge this is the first report externally validating the efficacy and tolerability of ponatinib hyper-CVAD for Ph ALL. We also show the feasibility of using this regimen in patients with Ph CML-LBC CML-MPBC and MPAL. Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature our study supports existing data demonstrating that this regimen challenges both the designation of Ph ALL as a high-risk disease and the trend to transplant in CR1. Our findings support that ponatinib hyper-CVAD should be considered a standard of care for Ph ALL.jatsp jatspFigure 1 Figure 1.jatsp jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspKaesberg Incyte Speakers Bureau.

    "abstract": "Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 GLRaV-3 is the most widely prevalent and economically important of the complex of RNA viruses associated with grapevine leafroll disease GLD. Phylogenetic studies have grouped GLRaV-3 isolates into nine different monophyletic groups and four supergroups making GLRaV-3 a genetically highly diverse virus species. In addition new divergent variants have been discovered recently around the world. Accurate identification of the virus is an essential component in the management and control of GLRaV-3 however the diversity of GLRaV-3 coupled with the limited sequence information have complicated the development of a reliable detection assay. In this study GLRaV-3 sequence data available in GenBank and those generated at Foundation Plant Services University of California-Davis was used to develop a new RT-qPCR assay with the capacity to detect all known GLRaV-3 variants. The new assay referred to as FPST was challenged against samples that included plants infected with different GLRaV-3 variants and originating from 46 countries. The FPST assay detected all known GLRaV-3 variants including the highly divergent variants by amplifying a small highly conserved region in the 3 untranslated terminal region UTR of the virus genome. The reliability of the new RT-qPCR assay was confirmed by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA that can detect all known GLRaV-3 variants characterized to date. Additionally three new GLRaV-3 divergent variants represented by four isolates were identified using a hierarchical testing process involving the FPST assay GLRaV-3 variant-specific assays and high-throughput sequencing analysis. These variants were distantly related to groups I II III V VI VII and IX but much similar to GLRaV-3 variants with no assigned group thus they may represent new clades. Finally based on the phylogenetic analysis a new GLRaV-3 subclade is proposed and named as group X.",

Our main theorem is that there is a non-vanishing gap above all ground states of this model for all values of J. Using a variety of methods we obtain additional information about the magnitude of this gap about its behavior for large Delta about its overall behavior as a function of Delta and its dependence on the ground state about the scaling of the gap and the structure of the low-lying spectrum for large J and about the existence of isolated eigenvalues in the excitation spectrum. By combining information obtained by perturbation theory numerical and asymptotic analysis we arrive at a number of interesting conjectures. The proof of the main theorem as well as some of the numerical results rely on a comparison result with a Solid-on-Solid SOS approximation. This SOS model itself raises interesting questions in combinatorics and we believe it will prove useful in the study of interfaces in the XXZ model in higher dimensions.",

    "abstract": "The end-of-life waste management of cathode ray tube CRT funnel glass is a concern due to the high lead content 22 within the glass. Inappropriate and insufficient waste management methods can lead to both health and climate impacts. This paper evaluates five waste management options hazardous waste landfill municipal waste landfill pyrometallurgy closed-loop recycling and hydrometallurgy from environmental and economic standpoints. Environmental impacts are analyzed using two life-cycle assessment LCA methodologies CML2001 and Eco-Indicator 99. Economic feasibilities are analyzed using the technical cost modeling TCM method and the cost revenue and profits associated with each waste management option are compared. Results show that discarded CRT funnel glass transportation has a significant effect on both the LCA and TCM results. By taking into account the transportation impact all waste management options result in greenhouse gas emissions and reduced profit. A sensitivity analysis shows that the profit of closed-loop recycling pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy options all decrease with increases in transportation distance while the hydrometallurgy option is less sensitive to the distance than the other two options. LCA results show that closed-loop recycling corresponds to the lowest human health and global warming impacts followed by pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. Landfill options would generate the most environmental impact. Closed-loop recycling pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy generate more profits 110-450ton than the landfill options 45ton. All in all pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are the most feasible recycling processes for implementation in the United States. Closed-loop recycling is not feasible because the CRT glass market in the U.S. has become obsolete. Overall pyrometallurgy appears to be the most environmentally friendly and economical CRT funnel glass waste management option. However the hydrometallurgy option represents the lowest human health impact due to minimized lead emissions. This option also has greater opportunity for process improvement and is more geographically flexible including the potential to be executed on-site which allows this novel option the opportunity to become more competitive than the pyrometallurgy option if properly implemented. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDOBJECTIVE Many studies have shown a U-shaped association of sleep duration with mortality however this association is difficult to interpret owing to possible reverse causation residual confounding and measurement issues. We used data from the Womens Health Initiative to examine the associations of sleep duration insomnia and use of sleep aids with death from cardiovascular disease CVD cancer other causes and all causes combined. METHODS Cox proportional hazards models were used in the analysis of baseline data and in time-dependent analyses of repeated measures to estimate associations of sleep-related factors with mortality. Among 158203 women with information regarding sleep 30400 total deaths 8857 CVD deaths 9284 cancer deaths and 11928 other deaths were ascertained over a median of 17.8 years. RESULTS In both baseline and time-dependent analyses both short 5 h and long sleep 9 h durations were associated with increased risk of total CVD and other deaths but not with cancer deaths. Insomnia showed no association with mortality whereas use of sleep medications was associated with an increased mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS While our findings showed a small but robust association of sleep duration with mortality in postmenopausal women studies including objective measurements of sleep quality and efficiency are needed to clarify these associations.",

We used parallel factor analysis PARAFAC of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices EEMs and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon BDOC incubations to investigate changes in the biochemical composition and lability of terrigenous DOM in three estuaries of coastal southeastern Alaska 1 a watershed with high glacial coverage 2 low glacial coverage and 3 low glacial coverage and high wetland coverage. Laboratory BDOC incubations were conducted for each site by inoculating filtered river water with microbial inocula collected from four different salinities 0 2 10 and 25 along the estuarine transect. The percent BDOC for all three sites ranged from 22 to 44 for the 28-day incubations and was greatest in the estuary draining the highly glaciated watershed. Moreover percent BDOC was greatest for river water samples inoculated with marine compared to freshwater bacteria suggesting marine bacterioplankton were able to utilize a larger fraction of the terrigenous DOM pool than riverine microbes. PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence EEMs showed non-conservative estuarine mixing behavior for DOM including removal at low salinities and addition at mid-high salinities for all three sites. For example tyrosine-like fluorescence decreased dramatically between salinity values 0 and 0.5 and was undetectable by salinity 2 for all three estuaries. However humic-like C4 correlated with aliphatic carbon content and tryptophan-like fluorescence increased non-conservatively during estuarine mixing likely associated with an increase in bacterioplankton growth. These results indicate that terrigenous DOM particularly from glacial runoff is an important source of carbon and nutrients to near-shore coastal zones of southeast Alaska. 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Medical Association have released recommendations for childhood obesity treatment and prevention which include interventions related to physical and sedentary activity. This review explores recent updates in the area of physical activity and sedentary behavior related to these recommendations as well as emerging evidence relevant to physical activity among children with disabilities. RECENT FINDINGS Safety and access are among some of the environmental barriers to childrens participation in extracurricular physical activity that need to be addressed. Analyses of the relationship between physical activity and sedentary screen time continue to show inconsistent results although evidence in support of active video games is increasing. Children with disabilities are a special subpopulation for whom physical activity should particularly be encouraged. SUMMARY Increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behaviors are essential components of obesity management in children with and without disabilities. Pediatric providers are encouraged to address barriers to physical activity with all families and act as advocates for changes in the local community that support access to physical activity for all children.",

The amounts of reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide non-enzymatic antioxidants and antioxidases and cell membrane lipid peroxidation in sweet cherries were determined. Nano-silica coating pressurized Ar and the combination of these two treatments all significantly delayed senescence by suppressing decay rate and maintained good sensory quality. In additional all treatments inhibited the generation and accumulation of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide and mitigated the lipid peroxidation of cell membranes of sweet cherries. The combination of these two treatments maintained higher contents of ascorbic acid and glutathione and enhanced the activities of antioxidases in sweet cherries. It is suggested that nano-silica coating and pressure Ar mediated the ROS metabolism which might have a role in retaining the quality sweet cherries during cold storage.",

Elsewhere they overgrow native salt marsh and open intertidal mudflats diminish biota increase costs of managing wildlife and interfere with human uses of estuaries. Huge efforts have been mounted to kill some populations of invading Spartina. All large Spartina invasions are by S. densiflora 2n 7x als 70 or S. alterniflora 2n als 6x als 62 or hybrids between the hexaploid species 2n als 6x. Hybridization is a recurrent theme in Spartina the allododecaploid S. anglica 2n als 12x als 120 and the hybrid swarm in San Francisco Bay arose through the introductions of S. alterniflora into the range of native Spartina species. The ancient hybrid S. densiflora also hybridized with native Spartina species. Hybridization promotes the evolution of highly invasive populations and hampers control efforts. Whether Spartina native and not would protect the shore as sea levels rise depends upon unimpeded areas for upward marsh growth and sufficient sediment conditions that are often not satisfied.

    "abstract": "Purpose A computer-aided diagnosis CADx system for breast masses is proposed which incorporates both handcrafted and convolutional radiomic features embedded into a single deep learning model. Approach The model combines handcrafted and convolutional radiomic signatures into a multi-view architecture which retrieves three-dimensional 3D image information by simultaneously processing multiple two-dimensional mass patches extracted along different planes through the 3D mass volume. Each patch is processed by a stream composed of two concatenated parallel branches a multi-layer perceptron fed with automatically extracted handcrafted radiomic features and a convolutional neural network for which discriminant features are learned from the input patches. All streams are then concatenated together into a final architecture where all network weights are shared and the learning occurs simultaneously for each stream and branch. The CADx system was developed and tested for diagnosis of breast masses N 284 using image datasets acquired with independent dedicated breast computed tomography systems from two different institutions. The diagnostic classification performance of the CADx system was compared against other machine and deep learning architectures adopting handcrafted and convolutional approaches and three board-certified breast radiologists. Results On a test set of 82 masses 45 benign 37 malignant the proposed CADx system performed better than all other model architectures evaluated with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve AUC of 0.05 0.02 and achieving a final AUC of 0.947 outperforming the three radiologists AUC 0.814 - 0.902 . Conclusions In conclusion the system demonstrated its potential usefulness in breast cancer diagnosis by improving mass malignancy assessment.",

    "abstract": "Successful lactation and the risk for developing breast cancer depend on growth and differentiation of the mammary gland MG epithelium that is regulated by ovarian steroids 17-estradiol E and progesterone P and pituitary-derived prolactin PRL. Given that the MG of pigs share histomorphogenic features present in the normal human breast we sought to define the transcriptional responses within the MG of pigs following exposure to all combinations of these hormones. Hormone-ablated female pigs were administered combinations of E medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate source of P and either haloperidol to induce PRL or 2-bromo--ergocryptine. We subsequently monitored phenotypic changes in the MG including mitosis receptors for E and P ESR1 and PGR level of phosphorylated STAT5 pSTAT5 and the frequency of terminal ductal lobular unit TDLU subtypes these changes were then associated with all transcriptomic changes. Estrogen altered the expression of approximately 20 of all genes that were mostly associated with mitosis whereas PRL stimulated elements of fatty acid metabolism and an inflammatory response. Several outcomes including increased pSTAT5 highlighted the ability of E to enhance PRL action. Regression of transcriptomic changes against several MG phenotypes revealed 1669 genes correlated with proliferation among which 29 were E inducible. Additional gene expression signatures were associated with TDLU formation and the frequency of ESR1 or PGR. These data provide a link between the hormone-regulated genome and phenome of the MG in a species having a complex histoarchitecture like that in the human breast and highlight an underexplored synergy between the actions of E and PRL during MG development.",

    "abstract": "PROBLEM All-Terrain Vehicles ATVs cause a distressing number of fatalities and injuries among farm youth in the United States. The number of severe injuries caused by ATV crashes on farms which stood at 25 children in 2019 is expected to rise due to increased ATV sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing research into childrens injuries has explored physical capabilities like anthropometry strength and visual acuity. Yet studies assessing youths physical ability to operate ATVs remain limited. This study tests the hypothesis that diminished vision field in young ATV operators raises crash risks. METHODS This study used SAMMIECAD digital human modeling system to simulate and compare the field of vision of youth and adult ATV operators. The simulations incorporated 3-D mockups of ATVs humans sprayer tanks windshields and obstacles. Ten utility ATVs and children of both genders across nine ages 8-16 and three height percentiles 5th 50th 95th were evaluated. RESULTS Simulations showed that young ATV operators generally have a more restricted field of vision than adults particularly those aged 6-11 years. DISCUSSION Visual limitations hinder riders ability to see ATV controls potentially leading to vehicle control loss. Moreover they impair environmental perception during riding compromising youths ATV operation abilities and increasing crash risks. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS These findings offer crucial data in support of modifying ATV safety guidelines. Additionally they can guide youth occupational health professionals in preventing ATV-related incidents in agricultural settings.",

One or more of these symptoms will affect nearly all people with dementia over the course of their illness. These symptoms are among the most complex stressful and costly aspects of care and they lead to a myriad of poor patient health outcomes healthcare problems and income loss for family care givers. The causes include neurobiologically related disease factors unmet needs care giver factors environmental triggers and interactions of individual care giver and environmental factors. The complexity of these symptoms means that there is no one size fits all solution and approaches tailored to the patient and the care giver are needed. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be used first line although several exceptions are discussed. Non-pharmacologic approaches with the strongest evidence base involve family care giver interventions. Regarding pharmacologic treatments antipsychotics have the strongest evidence base although the risk to benefit ratio is a concern. An approach to integrating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments is described. Finally the paradigm shift needed to fully institute tailored treatments for people and families dealing with these symptoms in the community is discussed.",

These patients present unique procedural and patient-specific risks that standard risk models do not fully capture. This study aims to assess risk in infants 2.5 kg undergoing CCC further stratifying by procedural type to better understand predictors of clinically meaningful adverse events CMAE. Patient and Procedural data were collected on diagnostic and interventional catheterization procedures for infants 2.5 kg from the Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes C3PO registry between 2014 and 2022. Cases were stratified into historical 2014-2018 and modern 2019-2022 eras and further categorized into PDA closure and All Other Cases. Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations between covariates and the risk of CMAE. Analysis included 1345 cases. In the modern era PDA closures n 898 66.8 had a lower CMAE rate at 3.6 versus 8.1 for All Other Cases P 0.001. Among All Other Cases n 447 23 were diagnostic and 77 interventional with CMAE rates of 7.7 and 6.4 respectively. CMAE types varied with PDA cases mainly experiencing respiratory events 22 and All Other Cases showing higher rates of access complications 27 and arrhythmias 29. Risk in infants 2.5 kg undergoing CCC is heavily dependent on procedural type and specific patient factors highlighting the need for tailored risk assessment tools.

    "abstract": "We review the pNGB quintessence models and point out that the reason why the large decay constants are really needed is to tame a tachyonic instability present for a wide range of initial vevs. Starting very close to potential maxima does not help because quantum fluctuations during early inflation at a scale H I perturb the quintessence vev displacing it from the maxima. This issue is quite interesting for pNGB dark energy in light of the recently discussed difficulties with embedding models with f aM Pl in fundamental theory. A possible way around is provided by models with several ultralight pNGBs which can drive a short burst of very late inflation together even if all of their decay constants obey f aM Pl. Starting with their vevf a the pNGBs will hold each other up on the potential for a longer time period. Their effective dynamics is captured by a collective mode containing admixtures of all of the rolling pNGBs which behaves as an ultralight field with f eff M Pl. We point out that there may be potentially observable large scale disturbances in the sea of dark energy in such models. 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.",

We introduce a general framework where feedback on the current state of a network is used to dynamically alter the values of such parameters. A specific model is analyzed where limited resources are shared among arriving nodes all vying to connect close to the root. We show that tunable feedback leads to growth of larger more efficient networks. Exact results show that linear scaling of resources with system size yields crossover to a trivial condensed state which can be considerably delayed with sublinear scaling.",

However the association of early mortality 60 days with location of initial care sociodemographic factors and complications has not been evaluated in pediatric and young adult YA patients with ALL. METHODS Using the California Cancer Registry linked to hospitalization data we identified pediatric and YA patients with ALL who received inpatient leukemia treatment between 1991 and 2014. Patients were classified as receiving all or partnone of their care at an SCC Childrens Oncology Group- or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. Propensity scores were created for treatment at an SCC in each age group. Multivariable inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models identified factors associated with early mortality. Results are presented as hazard ratios HRs and 95 CIs. RESULTS Among 6531 newly diagnosed pediatric 18 years and YA 19 to 39 years of age patients with ALL 1.6 of children and 5.4 of YAs died within 60 days of diagnosis. Most children received all of their care at an SCC n 4752 85.7 compared with 35.5 of YAs n 1779. Early mortality rates were lower in pediatric patients and those receiving all care at an SCC pediatric all 1.5 v partnone 2.4 P .049 YAs all 3.2 v partnone 6.6 P .001. However in adjusted models receiving all care at an SCC was associated with significantly lower early mortality in YAs HR 0.51 95 CI 0.32 to 0.81 but not in pediatric patients HR 0.77 95 CI 0.47 to 1.25. CONCLUSION YAs with ALL experience significant reductions in early mortality after treatment at SCCs.",

    "abstract": "Summary Transgenic plant production technology though relatively a new arena in modern plant science has an immense potential to change the shape of agriculture and offer new opportunities in the field of modern agrobiotechnology. The use of transgenic plants in expressing recombinant foreign proteins in crop plants demonstrates the feasibility of using this approach for the production of biopharmaceutical products. However several environmental conditions such as salinity drought and extreme temperatures are major limiting factors for plant growth and crop productivity. Hightemperature stress is highly unfavorable in optimal growth of plants but nearly 25 of total arable land is affected by heat and drought stress. It is estimated that more than one-third of all of the irrigated land in the world is presently affected by salinity and this is exclusive of those regions already classified as arid and desert lands which comprise 25 of the total land of our planet. The problem of drought stress is even more severe and economically damaging. Drought and salinity is predicted to cause serious salinization of more than 50 of all arable land by the year 2050. Moreover the problem is that conventional plant-breeding tools have been of only partial help so far in alleviating these abiotic stress problems. Recent microarray studies have been employed to examine expression profiles of the whole genomes of some plants in response to saline and drought stress. The use of microarray techniques has significantly accelerated efforts in assigning the functional role of genes involved in plant responses to saline and drought stresses and shed light on possible involvement of regulatory pathways in stress tolerance. This information is used for planning new strategies to produce abiotic stress-tolerant transgenic plants and eventually to produce biopharmaceuticals in areas which are today not farmable at all. 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH Co.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Feline indolent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ICL is an uncommon neoplastic disease. There is currently no consensus on treatment recommendations for ICL. OBJECTIVE To report the clinical outcome of three cats with ICL treated with hypofractionated electron-beam radiotherapy RT. ANIMALS Three privately owned cats with ICL. MATERIALS AND METHODS Medical records and client surveys were reviewed. A diagnosis of probable ICL was based on history clinical presentation and histopathological findings and confirmed using CD3 immunohistochemical analysis and PCR for antigen receptor gene rearrangement PARR. All cats were treated with hypofractionated RT four fractions of 8 Gy. RESULTS All cats presented with skin lesions characterised by erythema and alopecia that were refractory to previous treatment with systemic glucocorticoids. Before hypofractionated RT treatment lesions were histologically described as having diffuse infiltration of the dermis with CD3 T cells. Molecular clonality analysis revealed clonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement. After RT two cats showed histological improvement defined by decreased infiltration of lymphocytes with cellular infiltrate present only in the deeper dermis one cat had near complete histological resolution of lesions with only minimal residual lymphocytes. One cat was determined to have a complete clinical response while the other showed partial responses. No acute adverse effects of radiation were observed chronic effects included leukotrichia partial alopecia and mild fibrosis. All clients reported improvement in quality of life for their cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Clinical and histological improvement in these cats suggests that hypofractionated RT can be a useful treatment modality for cats with ICL.",

We consider the case when each vehicle-to-infrastructure V2I link shares spectrum with multiple vehicle-to-vehicle V2V links. Leveraging the slow fading statistical CSI of mobile links we maximize the sum V2I capacity while guaranteeing the reliability of all V2V links. We use graph partitioning tools to divide highly interfering V2V links into different clusters before formulating the spectrum sharing problem as a weighted 3-D matching problem. We propose a suite of algorithms including a baseline graph-based resource allocation algorithm a greedy resource allocation algorithm and a randomized resource allocation algorithm to address the performance-complexity tradeoffs. We further investigate resource allocation adaption in response to slow fading CSI of all vehicular links and develop a low-complexity randomized algorithm.",

OBJECTIVE To determine the association between plasma EFEMP1 levels and MRI markers of vascular brain injury and incident all-cause and Alzheimers disease AD dementia. METHODS We measured plasma EFEMP1 levels in 1597 53 women mean age 68.7 SD 5.7 years dementia-free Framingham Offspring cohort participants between 1998-2001 and subsequently followed them for incident dementia. Secondary outcomes included stroke structural MRI brain measures and neurocognitive test performance. RESULTS During a median 11.8 Q1 Q3 7.1 13.3 year follow-up 131 participants developed dementia. The highest quintile of plasma EFEMP1 compared to the bottom four quintiles was associated with an increased risk of time to incident all-cause dementia HR 1.77 95 CI 1.18-2.64 and AD dementia HR 1.76 95 CI 1.11-2.81 but not with markers of vascular brain injury WMH covert brain infarcts or stroke. Higher circulating EFEMP1 concentrations were also cross-sectionally associated with lower total brain SE -0.280.11 p 0.01 and hippocampal volumes -0.0060.003 p 0.04 and impaired abstract reasoning Similarities test -0.180.08 p 0.018 per standard deviation increment in EFEMP1. CONCLUSION Elevated circulating EFEMP1 is associated with an increased risk of all-cause and AD dementia smaller hippocampal and total brain volumes and poorer cognitive performance. EFEMP1 may play an important biological role in the development of AD dementia. Further studies to validate these findings are warranted.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study with dogs at least 1-year post treatment. Computed tomography was performed and quantitative measurements from previous fracture sites were compared with measurements from contralateral limbs. Subjective evaluation included gait assessment and palpation. RESULTS Six patients met the inclusion criteria. The rhBMP-2 treated bone exhibited higher density at the periphery and lower density in the centre similar to the contralateral limb. All patients were weight bearing on the treated limb and all fractures were healed. CONCLUSION The rhBMP-2-treated bone underwent restoration of normal architecture and density. Acceptable limb function was present in all patients. The results of this study can serve as a basis for long-term response in treating nonunion fractures in veterinary patients.",

    "abstract": "AIM Coinfecting bacterial pathogens are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in influenza. However there remains a paucity of literature on the magnitude of coinfection in influenza patients. METHOD A systematic search of MeSH Cochrane Library Web of Science SCOPUS EMBASE and PubMed was performed. Studies of humans in which all individuals had laboratory confirmed influenza and all individuals were tested for an array of common bacterial species met inclusion criteria. RESULTS Twenty-seven studies including 3215 participants met all inclusion criteria. Common etiologies were defined from a subset of eight articles. There was high heterogeneity in the results I2 95 with reported coinfection rates ranging from 2 to 65. Although only a subset of papers were responsible for observed heterogeneity subanalyses and meta-regression analysis found no study characteristic that was significantly associated with coinfection. The most common coinfecting species were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus which accounted for 35 95 CI 14-56 and 28 95 CI 16-40 of infections respectively a wide range of other pathogens caused the remaining infections. An assessment of bias suggested that lack of small-study publications may have biased the results. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of coinfection in the published studies included in this review suggests that although providers should consider possible bacterial coinfection in all patients hospitalized with influenza they should not assume all patients are coinfected and be sure to properly treat underlying viral processes. Further high heterogeneity suggests additional large-scale studies are needed to better understand the etiology of influenza bacterial coinfection.",

    "abstract": "Accurate ab initio simulation of protein folding is a critical step toward elucidation of protein-folding mechanisms. Here we demonstrate highly accurate folding of the 35 residue villin headpiece subdomain HP35 by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using AMBER FF03 and the generalized-Born solvation model. In a set of 20 micros long simulations the protein folded to the native state in multiple trajectories with the lowest Calpha RMSD being 0.39 A for residues 2-34 excluding residues 1 and 35. The native state had the highest population among all sampled conformations and the center of most populated cluster had a Calpha RMSD of 1.63 A. Folding of this protein can be described as a two-stage process that followed a well-defined pathway. In the first stage formation of helices II and III as a folding intermediate constituted the rate-limiting step and was initiated at a folding nucleus around residues Phe17 and Pro21. The folding intermediate further acted as a template that facilitated the folding and docking of helix I in the second stage. Detailed descriptions of the folding kinetics and the roles of key residues are presented.",

Seventeen horses with clinical infection as well as nineteen healthy herdmates all part of an EHM outbreak were enrolled in the study. Each horse was sampled two-four times at intervals of 2-6 days during the outbreak. All samples were collected using 6 rayon-tipped swabs. Nasal secretions were used as the diagnostic sample of choice. Additional samples including swabs from the muzzlenares swabs from the front limbs rectal swabs swabs of the feed bin and swabs of the water troughs were collected as well. All swabs were tested for the presence of EHV-1 by qPCR. With the exception of two EHV-1 qPCR-positive swabs from two different horses all remaining swabs collected from healthy herdmates tested qPCR-negative for EHV-1. For horses with clinical infection EHV-1 was detected in 31 nasal swabs 30 muzzlenares swabs 7 front limb swabs 7 feeders 6 water troughs and 6 rectal swabs. Not all positive muzzlenares swabs correlated with a positive nasal swab from the same set however and all other positive swabs did correlate with a positive nasal swab in their respective set. The agreement between nasal swabs and muzzlenares swabs was 74. The sampling of non-invasive swabs from the muzzlenares should facilitate the identification of EHV-1 shedders during an outbreak allowing for prompt isolation and implementation of biosecurity measures.",

In agreement with earlier work we find only a single electron loss 130 meV in the specular direction while away from the specular direction additional losses at 80 meV and 160 meV appear. These losses correspond to the symmetric stretching the wagging and the asymmetric stretching modes respectively of H atoms occupying a C2V bridge site. Large intensity variations of all these modes are found in backscattering directions and out of the incidence plane in general agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The usefulness of these spatial intensity variations in adsorbate structure determination will be discussed. The signal enhancement with electron collection in the plane orthogonal to the incidence plane may allow the observation of otherwise weak impact modes. 1983 Elsevier Science Technology.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate intraretinal anatomy in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration AMD using high-speed ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography hsUHR-OCT before and 1 month after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab. DESIGN Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS Twelve eyes of 12 patients. METHODS A broad bandwidth superluminescent diode laser light source and spectralFourier domain signal detection were used to create a prototype hsUHR-OCT instrument with 3.5 mum axial image resolution and approximately 25000 linessecond acquisition speed. Twelve eyes of 12 patients with exudative AMD were imaged with hsUHR-OCT before and 1 month after intravitreal ranibizumab injection. High pixel density and raster-scanned 3-dimensional 3D OCT data sets were generated. Three-dimensional imaging software was used to calculate subretinalretinal pigment epithelium fluid volume and volume of the fibrovascular lesion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Qualitative and quantitative analysis of hsUHR-OCT images and 3D data sets. RESULTS All eyes had some degree of normalization of macular contour after intravitreal ranibizumab. The innerouter photoreceptor segment junction visualized on hsUHR-OCT was discontinuous overlying the fibrovascular lesion in all 12 of 12 eyes both before and after treatment 9 of 12 eyes had focal areas of thinning of the outer nuclear layer which remained after treatment. Volumetric measurements were possible in 8 of 12 eyes with 3D-rendering software. Fibrovascular lesion volume did not change significantly after treatment. CONCLUSIONS hsUHR-OCT is capable of unprecedented imaging speed and resolution making it a valuable instrument in measuring in vivo intraretinal pathology. All 12 eyes had some normalization of macular contour. Fibrovascular lesion volume did not change significantly 1 month after treatment suggesting that ranibizumab does not cause much initial regression of preexisting neovascular tissue. Photoreceptor abnormalities remained in all patients after treatment of wet AMD suggesting that although ranibizumab improves overall retinal architecture some photoreceptor damage may be irreversible.

    "abstract": "Ecological rarity characterized by low abundance or limited distribution is typical of most species yet our understanding of what factors contribute to the persistence of rare species remains limited. Consequently little is also known about whether rare species might respond differently than common species to direct e.g. abiotic and indirect e.g. biotic effects of climate change. We investigated the effects of warming and exclusion of large herbivores on 14 tundra taxa three of which were common and 11 of which were rare at an inland low-arctic study site near Kangerlussuaq Greenland. Across all taxa pooled commonness was reduced by experimental warming and more strongly under herbivore exclusion than under herbivory. However taxon-specific analyses revealed that although warming elicited variable effects on commonness herbivore exclusion disproportionately reduced the commonness of rare taxa. Over the 15-year duration of the experiment we also observed trends in commonness and rarity under all treatments through time. Sitewide commonness increased for two common taxa the deciduous shrubs Betula nana and Salix glauca and declined in six other taxa all of which were rare. Rates of increase or decline in commonness i.e. temporal trends over the duration of the experiment were strongly related to baseline commonness of taxa early in the experiment under all treatments except warming with grazing. Hence commonness itself may be a strong predictor of species responses to climate change in the arctic tundra biome but large herbivores may mediate such responses in rare taxa perhaps facilitating their persistence.",

This approach was previously introduced and applied to d k constrained codes. Results show that the maximum average rate of the bit stuffing code achieves capacity when k d 1 or k while it is suboptimal for all other d k pairs. Furthermore this technique was generalized to produce codes with an average rate that achieves capacity for all d k pairs. However this extension results in a more complicated scheme. This correspondence proposes a modification to the bit stuffing algorithm that maintains its simplicity. We show analytically that the proposed algorithm achieves improved average rates over bit stuffing for most d k constraints. We further determine all constraints for which this scheme produces codes with an average rate equal to the Shannon capacity. 2005 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatssec jatstitleIntroductionjatstitle jatspRecent evidence indicates that increased frailty is associated with increased mortality in patients with burn injuries over the age of 50 years old. This work found that 35.7 of burn patients over 65 years old were frail at the time of their burn admission while 19.2 of burn patients 50 to 64 years old were frail. While frailty is associated with increased age the two are separate entities suggesting that frailty may be present in much younger patients who present with burn injuries. We hypothesize that frailty exists in all age groups of patients presenting with burn injury and the prevalence increases with age.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleMethodsjatstitle jatspFollowing IRB approval a 5-year 20142019 retrospective chart review was conducted of all burn patients admitted to the burn center. Data collected includes age gender and burn size TBSA. Frailty was determined using the Modified Frailty Index 11 MFI 11 from co-morbidities included in the burn registry. Patients were considered frail if they have an MFI 2 and pre-frail for an MFI1 and amplt 2. Patients were assessed by decades for age. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics chi-square and t-tests.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleResultsjatstitle jatspA total of 2173 patients mean age 46.117.3 years 1584 males 72.8 mean TBSA 12.516.3 were analyzed. All age groups included patients who were pre-frail Table 1. In the under 20-year-old group 8.5 were pre-frail. This increases with each age group to the 71-80-year-old group in which 41.7 of patients are pre-frail. The over 80-year-old group had slightly fewer pre-frail patients 35.9. There were no frail patients in the under 20-year-old group. In the 2130 there were 3 patients 0.7 that had an MFI of 2 or more placing them in the frail group. Frailty was significantly different across the age groups pamplt 0.001. As patients age the proportion of female patients increases from 17.6 to 37.5. pamplt 0.0001. Frailty was also associated with gender with women having a higher percentage of frailty p0.0006. With respect to burn size age category was not associated with burn size p0.12 but frail patients had smaller burns than non-frail or pre-frail patients 9.5 vs. 13.3 vs. 12.2 p0.0002.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleConclusionsjatstitle jatspPre-frail patients were identified in all age groups. Frailty was present in all age groups except for those who are under 20 years of age. Frailty was associated with female sex and smaller burns. By not specifically looking for frailty in all burn patients admitted to the hospital we are potentially missing frail patients who may benefit from interventions to improve their outcomes.jatsp jatsp jatssec",

Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether athletic performance or some physical fitness measure is affected by prior sexual activity. Web of Science all databases and Google Scholar were used to identify studies from which adult healthy subjects were included. As all studies were crossover trials an inverse variance statistical method with random effects was used to minimize the uncertainty of the pooled effect estimate. Bias was assessed via the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool RoB 2 with a per protocol analysis. Nine crossover studies 133 subjects 99 male were used in this meta-analysis. All those studies did not examine athletic performance per se but all studies assessed one or more physical fitness parameters. The RoB 2 suggested that overall there were some concerns with bias. As there was moderate heterogeneity amongst the different outcomes Tau2 0.02 Chi-square 17.2 df 8 p 0.03 I2 54 a random-effects model was used.

    "abstract": "The main background for the supersymmetric stop direct production search comes from Standard Model tt events. For the single-lepton search channel we introduce a few kinematic variables to further suppress this background by focusing on its dileptonic and semileptonic topologies. All are defined to have end points in the background but not signal distributions. They can substantially improve the stop signal significance and mass reach when combined with traditional kinematic variables such as the total missing transverse energy. Among them our variable MWT2has the best overall performance because it uses all available kinematic information including the on-shell mass of both Ws. We see 20-30 improvement on the discovery significance and estimate that the 8TeV LHC run with 20 fb-1 of data would be able to reach an exclusion limit of 650-700 GeV for direct stop production as long as the stop decays dominantly to the top quark and a light stable neutralino. Most of the mass range required for the supersymmetric solution of the naturalness problem in the standard scenario can be covered..",

    "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferase GST isozymes were purified from the GG strain of Aedes aegypti a strain having 4-fold higher total GST activity compared to the wild-type lab strain. Purification involved S-hexyl-glutathione affinity chromatography in high salt buffer and GST specific elution with S-p-bromobenzyl-glutathione. Final purification was accomplished on DEAE-Sepharose. Two isozymes GST-1b and GST-2 were purified using this procedure and an additional isozyme GST-1a was partially purified. The GST-2 isozyme has one of the highest specific activities reported for a GST with a specific activity of 739 molminmg using 1-chloro-24-dinitrobenzene CDNB and 16.4 molminmg using 34-dichloronitrobenzene DCNB as substrates. GST-2 GST-1a and GST-1b were analyzed for amino acid composition and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. All three GSTs showed amino acid differences especially among the nonpolar and polar amino acids. The amino acid composition of GST-1b was found to be more similar to GST 1-1 from Drosophila melanogaster than to GST-2 or GST-1a from Aedes aegypti. Only GST-2 gave N-terminal sequence data raising the possibility that GST-1a and 1b are N-terminally blocked. The A. aegypti GST-2 showed amino acid sequence identity or similarity in all but one residue between residue numbers 31 through 41 compared to the D. melanogaster and Musca domestica GST 1-1 isozymes. The pattern of GST isozyme expression was analyzed in various tissues and stages of development of the GG and wild type strains using isozyme-specific antisera and substrates. GST-1a was constitutively overexpressed in all tissues examined in the GG strain compared to the wild type strain. The expression of GST-1b was similar in both strains for all tissues and developmental stages examined. GST-2 was constitutively overexpressed in head thorax and abdomen but was not detected in ovaries of the GG strain. These results suggest that elevated GST activity in the GG strain is due to constitutive overexpression of GST-2 and GST-1a. GST-1a GST-1b and GST-2 apparently are the products of 3 independently regulated genes and appear to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. 1991.",

    "abstract": "Some lettuce cultivars are highly sensitive to triforine an inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis found in some commercial systemic fungicides. First symptoms of a sensitive reaction are usually observed within 24-48 h after treatment and include severe wilting necrosis and rapid plant death. We mapped a single dominant gene Tr that confers sensitivity of lettuce to triforine to linkage group 1 of the integrated genetic map of lettuce. The occurrence of sensitivity is not uniform across horticultural types of lettuce. While over 80 of green-romaine lettuce cultivars tested were sensitive most cultivars of all other lettuce types were insensitive to triforine. All accessions of wild Lactuca spp. were insensitive to triforine. Allelism tests using F1 and F2 progeny revealed that sensitive cultivars of all horticultural types likely carry the same Tr gene. The dominant allele for sensitivity found in cultivated lettuce probably had a monophyletic origin. The reaction to triforine can be used as a marker for detecting hybrids originating from a cross between phenotypically similar parents with different responses to triforine treatment. It also provides an indication of genotypes for which applications of triforine-containing fungicides are inappropriate. 2011 Springer ScienceBusiness Media B.V. outside the USA.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new-generation Amber united-atom force field for simulations involving highly demanding conformational sampling such as protein folding and protein-protein binding. In the new united-atom force field all hydrogens on aliphatic carbons in all amino acids are united with carbons except those on Calpha. Our choice of explicit representation of all protein backbone atoms aims at minimizing perturbation to protein backbone conformational distributions and to simplify development of backbone torsion terms. Tests with dipeptides and solvated proteins show that our goal is achieved quite successfully. The new united-atom force field uses the same new RESP charging scheme based on B3LYPcc-pVTZHF6-31g quantum mechanical calculations in the PCM continuum solvent as that in the Duan et al. force field. van der Waals parameters are empirically refitted starting from published values with respect to experimental solvation free energies of amino acid side-chain analogues. The suitability of mixing new point charges and van der Waals parameters with existing Amber covalent terms is tested on alanine dipeptide and is found to be reasonable. Parameters for all new torsion terms are refitted based on the new point charges and the van der Waals parameters. Molecular dynamics simulations of three small globular proteins in the explicit TIP3P solvent are performed to test the overall stability and accuracy of the new united-atom force field. Good agreements between the united-atom force field and the Duan et al. all-atom force field for both backbone and side-chain conformations are observed. In addition the per-step efficiency of the new united-atom force field is demonstrated for simulations in the implicit generalized Born solvent. A speedup around two is observed over the Duan et al. all-atom force field for the three tested small proteins. Finally the efficiency gain of the new united-atom force field in conformational sampling is further demonstrated with a well-known toy protein folding system an 18 residue polyalanine in distance-dependent dielectric. The new united-atom force field is at least a factor of 200 more efficient than the Duan et al. all-atom force field for ab initio folding of the tested peptide.",

Income rises for all households as interest rate cuts directly affect firm investment and household consumption boosting aggregate demand. A crucial difference between the housing tenure groups is the composition of their balance sheets mortgagors hold sizable illiquid assets but little liquid wealth. Our results reveal that general equilibrium effects on household income coupled with balance-sheet-driven heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to consume play a key role in the transmission of monetary policy.jatsp",

All quercetin treatment groups produced increases in the GSHGSSG ratio and decreases in mixed disulfide levels in hepatic tissue. Cardiac tissue did not change in response to dietary quercetin however cardiac mitochondria demonstrated a reduction in the GSHGSSG ratio and an increase in protein mixed disulfide levels. No significant changes were observed in the plasma GSHGSSG ratio but mixed disulfide levels were decreased for all of the diets. The changes in plasma redox status did not parallel the changes in the tissues. Onion fed mice demonstrated the greatest increases in GSHGSSG ratios and the greatest decreases in protein mixed disulfide levels of all diets compared. For all treatment groups increases in the GSHGSSG ratios corresponded with decreases in protein mixed disulfide levels.

In ideal solutions it is exact but many solutions are known to have substantial deviations from Raoults law as conventionally interpreted. In 1908 Callendar showed that water hydrated to the solute can explain some of the departures from Raoults law in aqueous solution. Here we show that by simply assuming equilibria between the free water in solution and its hydrated forms Raoults law and Callendars extension are valid over the full range of concentrations while also showing how water and solutes interact in solution. This model of solutions has importance in highly concentrated solutions common in atmosphere aerosols relevant to climate change and air quality and in numerous industrial processes.",

    "abstract": "Harvest-aid robots that transport empty and full trays during manual harvesting of specialty crops such as strawberries or table grapes can increase harvest efficiency by reducing pickers non-productive walking times. In Part I of this work a modeling framework and a stochastic simulator were presented for all-manual and robot-aided harvesting. This paper reports Part II of our work which utilized data gathered in two strawberry fields during harvesting to estimate the stochastic parameters involved in modeling pickers and evaluate the prediction accuracy of the simulator for all-manual picking. Then as a case study non-productive time and harvest efficiency were estimated for robot-aided harvesting for various picker-robot ratios and three priority-based reactive dispatching strategies for the robots. The simulator predicted the pickers non-productive time during all-manual harvesting with 6.4 3 and 1.2 errors for the morning afternoon and all-day harvesting shifts respectively. Statistical testing verified that predicted non-productive times followed the same distributions as the measured non-productive times 5 significance level. Simulations robustness was assessed by using morning data to simulate afternoon harvesting and vice-versa non-productive times distributions were predicted accurately 10 significance level. Robot-aided simulation results using the calibrated simulator for a 25-picker crew showed that all-manual harvest efficiencies of 81.8 and 78.2 for morning and afternoon shifts increased to 92 and 86.5 respectively when five robots were deployed. Different scheduling policies did not affect efficiency when more than five robots were used because there were always enough robots to serve pickers requests immediately. Also harvest efficiency plateaued when more than five robots were used as a consequence of the time needed for a robot to travel to a picker.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to establish whether or not bicycle commuting and cycling for other purposes e.g. shopping visiting friends are related over time. Using previously gathered panel data the Dutch mobility panel these relationships are revealed by 1 a series of conditional change models and 2 a latent transition model. The conditional change models indicate that with a lag of 1 year and controlling for a range of background characteristics bicycle commuting and non-work cycling in number of weekly trips have a positive reciprocal influence on each other. The models show that work-related factors such as the distance to work or whether a person receives a travel allowance affect not only bicycle commuting but also non-work cycling. The latent transition model indicates that people can be clustered into four groups non-cyclists non-work cyclists all-around cyclists and commuter cyclists. This model shows that people with a consistent propensity to not cycle at all non-cyclists or to cycle for both work and non-work purposes all-around cyclists are most stable in their travel behavior. Non-work cyclists and commuter cyclists are less stable in travel behavior. The model also shows that all-around cyclists are not significantly affected by a change in the distance to work. The article concludes with several directions for future research. 2013 Springer ScienceBusiness Media New York.",

    "abstract": "Multiple datasets of two consecutive vintages of replicated grape and wines from six different deficit irrigation regimes are characterized and compared. The process consists of four temporal-ordered signature phases harvest field data juice composition wine composition before bottling and bottled wine. A new computing paradigm and an integrative inferential platform are developed for discovering phase-to-phase pattern geometries for such characterization and comparison purposes. Each phase is manifested by a distinct set of features which are measurable upon phase-specific entities subject to the common set of irrigation regimes. Throughout the four phases this compilation of data from irrigation regimes with subsamples is termed a space of media-nodes on which measurements of phase-specific features were recoded. All of these collectively constitute a bipartite network of data which is then normalized and binary coded. For these serial bipartite networks we first quantify patterns that characterize individual phases by means of a new computing paradigm called Data Mechanics. This computational technique extracts a coupling geometry which captures and reveals interacting dependence among and between media-nodes and feature-nodes in forms of hierarchical block sub-matrices. As one of the principal discoveries the holistic year-factor persistently surfaces as the most inferential factor in classifying all media-nodes throughout all phases. This could be deemed either surprising in its over-arching dominance or obvious based on popular belief. We formulate and test pattern-based hypotheses that confirm such fundamental patterns. We also attempt to elucidate the driving force underlying the phase-evolution in winemaking via a newly developed partial coupling geometry which is designed to integrate two coupling geometries. Such partial coupling geometries are confirmed to bear causal and predictive implications. All pattern inferences are performed with respect to a profile of energy distributions sampled from network bootstrapping ensembles conforming to block-structures specified by corresponding hypotheses.",

Future air quality regulations could mandate the use of no-till floor management practices in Californias Central Valley. We evaluated the combined effects of cover crop type oats alone or oats grown with legumes and tillage on soil nutrient availability vine nutrition growth and yield characteristics of Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot grown under regulated deficit irrigation in a commercial vineyard from 2008 to 2010. Five treatments were used Resident Vegetation RV Till Oats Till OatsLegumes Till Oats NoTill and OatsLegumes NoTill. No differences in soil nutrient availability were found among the treatments. Of the numerous nutritional constituents analyzed on leaf petioles and blades only NO3-Npetiole was affected by floor management. At nearly all growth stages among all years NO3-Npetiole of tilled treatments was twice the no-till treatments. At harvest yield mean cluster weight cluster number per vine and aboveground cover crop biomass differed among treatments in 2009 andor 2010 but not in the first year 2008 however responses were not consistent among treatments within each respective year. Importantly yields were similar from all four cover crop treatments compared to the typical management RV Till suggesting that use of cover crops andor no-till practices may be implemented in an irrigated vineyard with little immediate effect on grape productivity in mature vineyards. 2013 by the American Society for Enology and Viticulture.

Following foliar 10B application to leaves of various ages there was significant 10B export out of the treated leaves and significant 10B enrichment in nontreated adjacent organs including inflorescences and fruit. Results demonstrated that B can be remobilized from leaves of various ages and that foliar-applied B is phloem mobile in olive. Soluble carbohydrate analysis determined that mannitol and glucose are the predominant sugars in all organs analyzed and that the mannitol concentration in the leaves is adequate to account for all B transport. This is consistent with observations in other species where the presence of mannitol is known to facilitate phloem B transport through formation of a mannitol-B complex. Previous reports have indicated that B application can alter carbohydrate metabolism. In the present study foliar B application significantly suppressed glucose concentration in the leaf petioles of all ages and increased mannitol in petioles of the current-year-developed leaves.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Bacterial leafspot of lettuce BLS caused by Xanthomonas campes-tris pv. vitians has become more prevalent in many lettuce-growing areas of the world over the past decade. To gain insight into the nature of these outbreaks the genetic variation in X. campestris pv. vitians strains from different geographical locations was examined. All strains were first tested for pathogenicity on lettuce plants and then genetic diversity was assessed using i gas-chromatographic analysis of bacterial fatty acids ii polymerase chain reaction analysis of repetitive DNA sequences rep-PCR iii DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region 1 ITS1 of the ribosomal RNA iv restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP analysis of total genomic DNA with a repetitive DNA probe and v detection and partial characterization of plasmid DNA. Fatty acid analysis identified all pathogenic strains as X. campestris but did not consistently identify all the strains as X. campestris pv. vitians. The rep-PCR fingerprints and ITS1 sequences of all pathogenic X. campestris pv. vitians strains examined were identical and distinct from those of the other X. campestris pathovars. Thus these characteristics did not reveal genetic diversity among X. campestris pv. vitians strains but did allow for differentiation of X. campestris pathovars. Genetic diversity among X. campestris pv. vitians strains was revealed by RFLP analysis with a repetitive DNA probe and by characterization of plasmid DNA. This diversity was greatest among strains from different geographical regions although diversity among strains from the same location also was detected. The results of this study suggest that these X. campestris pv. vitians strains are not clonal but comprise a relatively homogeneous group.",

    "abstract": "Effects of light exposure and vine microclimate on C13- norisoprenoid concentration in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and wines were investigated by measuring the amounts of -damascenone megastigma-358- trien-7-one TDN 116-trimethyl-12-dihydronaphthalene and vitispirane 69-epoxy-3513-megastigmadiene using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In grapes and wines the most exposed treatment all lateral and primary leaves removed had the highest light intensity and temperature and showed the highest concentrations of TDN and vitispirane p 0.05. However in the more shaded treatments concentrations of all norisoprenoids were variable and dependent on the treatment conditions. When leaves were removed C13- norisoprenoid concentrations were linearly r 0.90 p 0.1 and positively correlated with increasing sunlight exposure. In contrast in the most shaded treatments with no leaf removal there were high concentrations of norisoprenoids. -Damascenone concentrations in particular were highest when no leaves were removed. Grapes and corresponding wines from the south side of the vine had higher levels of measured norisoprenoids than those from the north side. However the leaf layer number was also correlated r 0.89 p 0.1 with norisoprenoid concentration. Norisoprenoid concentrations in grapes were significantly correlated p 0.025 with those in wines. These results suggest that in addition to sunlight exposure leaf removal and cluster microclimate can significantly alter norisoprenoid concentrations in grapes and wines.

However misconfigurations in firewalls are very common and significantly weaken the desired security. This paper introduces FIREMAN a static analysis toolkit for firewall modeling and analysis. By treating firewall configurations as specialized programs FIREMAN applies static analysis techniques to check misconfigurations such as policy violations inconsistencies and inefficiencies in individual firewalls as well as among distributed firewalls. FIREMAN performs symbolic model checking of the firewall configurations for all possible IP packets and along all possible datapaths. It is both sound and complete because of the finite state nature of firewall configurations. FIREMAN is implemented by modeling firewall rules using binary decision diagrams BDDs which have been used successfully in hardware verification and model checking. We have experimented with FIREMAN and used it to uncover several real misconfigurations in enterprise networks some of which have been subsequently confirmed and corrected by the administrators of these networks. 2006 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Commercial and experimental mandarins consisting of 15 varieties were evaluated through a combination of consumer testing sensory descriptive analysis and metabolomic profiling over the course of 2 years. The objectives of the research were to compare repeated consumer clustering solutions and to evaluate the potential market success of new mandarin cultivars. Consumers rated their liking of various sensory modalities such as overall liking paired with Just-About-Right JAR scaling for sweetness sourness firmness and juiciness and Check-All-That-Apply attributes. Repeated preference clustering of the consumers across several tastings consistently revealed the presence of two clusters who differed in their liking of the sensory and chemical profiles of the fruit. The first cluster of consumers showed significant negative correlations with perceived sourness and concentration of citric acid and a left-skewed distribution of JAR sourness ratings as compared with the second cluster of consumers. The experimental varieties of DaisySL KinnowLS Shasta Gold and a commercially produced clementine sample had the highest overall liking rating of all 29 mandarins that were evaluated by the consumers. This work demonstrates that repeating clustering studies with a paired internal metric such as a JAR question may help to validate cluster solutions. Practical Applications These results show that conducting multiple consumer trials using different products may help to confirm hypotheses regarding cluster preferences for sensory and chemical profiles. Throughout this study the drivers of liking identified for the preference clusters were consistent with their JAR ratings of select attributes i.e. sourness. We suggest that clustering experiments should be conducted multiple times especially when ephemeral products like fruit are being studied to ensure that solutions are genuine. Additionally an internal metric such as a Just-About-Right question or a Check-All-That-Apply question may help to differentiate the consumer clusters.",

METHODS The timing and amplitude of the cone b-wave and isolated oscillatory potentials OP during the first 10 minutes of light adaptation in wild-type WT mice and two mutant lines without functional rods was examined rhodopsin knockout Rho-- lacking rod outer segments and NRL knockout Nrl-- in which rods are replaced by S-cones. Expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos which is increased in the inner retina by light-induced activity was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in dark- and light-adapted retinas. RESULTS WT b-wave and OP amplitudes increased and implicit times decreased during light adaptation. Subtracting OP did not alter b-wave changes. Rho-- b-wave and OP amplitudes did not increase during adaptation. B-wave timing and amplitude and the timing of the major OP at 1 minute of adaptation were equivalent to WT at 10 minutes. The light-adapted ERG b-wave in Nrl-- mice which originates in both the rod and cone pathways changed in absolute amplitude and timing similar to WT. C-fos expression was present in the inner retinas of dark-adapted Rho-- but not WT or Nrl-- mice. CONCLUSIONS Activity in the distal rod pathway produces changes in the cone ERG during light adaptation. Rods in Rho-- mice constitutively activate this rod-cone pathway interaction. The rod pathway S-cones in Nrl-- mice may maintain the WT interaction.",

    "abstract": "An Apollonian circle packing is a classical construction which is made by repeatedly inscribing circles into the triangular interstices in a Descartes configuration of four mutually tangent circles. Remarkably if the original four circles have integer curvature all of the circles in the packing will have integer curvature making the packings of interest from a number theoretic point of view. Many of the natural arithmetic problems have required new and sophisticated tools to solve them. The reason for this difficulty is that the study of Apollonian packings reduces to the study of a subgroup of GL4Z that is thin in a sense that we describe in this article and arithmetic problems involving thin groups have only recently become approachable in broad generality. In this article we report on what is currently known about Apollonian packings in which all circles have integer curvature and how these results are obtained. This survey is also meant to illustrate how to treat arithmetic problems related to other thin groups.",

One report describes the isolation of a new species Campylobacter insulaenigrae sp. nov. from three harbor seals Phoca vitulina and a harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena in Scotland and the other describes the isolation of Campylobacter jejuni Campylobacter lari and an unknown Campylobacter species from northern elephant seals Mirounga angustirostris in California. In this study 72 presumptive C. lari and unknown Campylobacter species strains were characterized using standard phenotypic methods 16S rRNA PCR and multilocus sequence typing MLST. Phenotypic characterization of these isolates showed them to be variable in their ability to grow either at 42 degrees C or on agar containing 1 glycine and in their sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cephalothin. Based on both 16S rRNA PCR and MLST all but 1 of the 72 isolates were C. insulaenigrae with one isolate being similar to but distinct from both Campylobacter upsaliensis and Campylobacter helveticus. Phylogenetic analysis identified two C. insulaenigrae clades the primary clade containing exclusively California strains and a secondary clade containing some California strains and all of the original Scottish strains. This study demonstrates the inability of phenotypic characterization to correctly identify all Campylobacter species and emphasizes the importance of molecular characterization via 16S rRNA sequence analysis or MLST for the identification of Campylobacter isolates from marine mammals.",

Although the overall survival rates are now 80 15-20 of pediatric patients relapse with survival rates subsequently dropping to 5-10. Cmpd10357 3-amino-5-arylamino-6-chloro-N- diaminomethylene pyrazine-2-carboximide is a highly potent cell-permeant compound recently shown to have cytotoxic effects on solid tumors including human breast cancer and high-grade gliomas independent of their proliferative status. Cmpd10357 demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in two human B-ALL cell lines JM1 and Reh at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations IC50 of 3.2 and 3.3 M respectively. Cmpd10357 at a dose of 5 mgkg significantly prolonged survival in our B-ALL xenograft mouse model with a median survival time of 49.0 days compared with 45.5 days in the control group p 0.05. The cytotoxicity of Cmpd10357 demonstrated caspase-independent nonapoptotic cancer cell demise associated with the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor AIF. The cytotoxicity of Cmpd10357 in B-ALL cells was inhibited by Necrostatin-1 but not by Necrosulfonamide. These studies suggest that an AIF-mediated caspase-independent necrosis mechanism of Cmpd10357 in B-ALL could be used in combination with traditional apoptotic chemotherapeutic agents.",

Large injections of retrograde tracers involving all layers of the LGN resulted in a distinctive bilaminar distribution of labeled cells in cortical layer 6. One tier of labeled neurons was located along the layer 5-6 border and a second was located near the bottom of the layer leaving the middle of layer 6 largely free of labeled neurons. Following injections of tracers that were restricted to the magnocellular layers of the LGN almost all of the labeled neurons were located in the lower tier. In contrast following injections of retrograde tracers confined to the parvocellular layers of the LGN labeled cells were found in both tiers with the greatest number in the upper tier. Thus layer 6 of macaque striate cortex consists of three distinct sublayers only two of which are the source of descending projections to the LGN an upper tier that projects exclusively to the parvocellular layers and a lower tier that projects to both magnocellular and parvocellular layers.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW To assess the efficacy benefits and limitations of available and emerging follow-up options for medication abortion. RECENT FINDINGS Medication abortion follow-up does not have to be a one size fits all protocol. From most to least invasive follow-up options include facility-based ultrasound laboratory-based repeat serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin hCG testing urine hCG testing high sensitivity low sensitivity and multilevel pregnancy tests self-assessment with symptom evaluation and no intervention. Provider or facility-dependent follow-up including ultrasound and serum testing are effective but have several limitations including needing to return to a facility and cost. Remote client-led follow-up options such as urine pregnancy testing and symptoms evaluation are well tolerated and effective for ruling out the rare outcome of ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion and have several advantages. Advantages include being inexpensive and flexible. However it is important to note that low-sensitivity and multilevel pregnancy tests are not available in all settings. In studies evaluating client-led follow-up with urine pregnancy tests ongoing pregnancies were identified over half the time with symptoms alone. SUMMARY Guidelines from several professional organizations have aligned with the evidence and no longer recommend routine office-based follow-up. To ensure care is person-centered providers should offer follow-up options that align with the comfort logistical ability and values of the client.",

By monitoring the frequencies and intensities of vibrational absorption modes due to phosphate and methylene functional groups in the head and tail regions of the phospholipid we differentiated the adsorption state of the precursor vesicles i.e. intact vs ruptured vesicles as a function of vesicular size in the SUV limit and the properties of the aqueous-phase solvent. We found that on oxidized gold vesicles of DPPC in ultra pure water remained intact for all sizes tested viz. 65 80 and 160 nm with varying degree of deformation. In contrast when phosphate-buffered saline PBS was used as a bathing medium all vesicles remained intact were more distorted than the same size in pure water and appeared to be nearly fully collapsed. Taken together these results provide a rough guide for controlling vesicular behavior at the oxidized gold surface.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dry cow therapy DCT on the antimicrobial resistance AMR profile of mastitis pathogens post-calving. A repository of isolates based on a DCT trial was utilized for the current study. A stratified random survey sample of cows from the trial were identified within the strata of season herd and trial treatment resulting in 382 cows. All isolates from the 382 cows were selected for the current study which identified 566 isolates from milk samples collected at dry off S1 post-calving S2 and at the first clinical mastitis event up to 150 days in milk S3. The AMR profiles were determined using broth microdilution method. Less than 10 of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species CNS isolates n 421 were resistant to tetracycline ceftiofur penicillinnovobiocin or erythromycin while higher proportions of resistance to sulfadimethoxine 72 and penicillin 28 were observed. All Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus isolates n 4 were susceptible to all tested AMD except sulfadimethoxine to which all isolates were resistant. Similarly all Streptococcus spp. n 37 were susceptible to penicillin penicillinnovobiocin and ampicillin while resistant to tetracycline 17. All coliforms n 21 were susceptible to ceftiofur but resistance was recorded for sulfadimethoxine 70 cephalothin 56 and tetracycline 43. The increased resistance percent from S1 to S2 was observed in CNS isolates from AMD-treated cows with the highest increase recorded for penicillin 12.2. Parametric survival interval regression models were used to explore the association between antimicrobial drug AMD therapy at dry off and the AMR phenotype post-calving. The accelerated failure-time metric was adopted to minimum inhibitory concentration measurements to permit interpretation of model exponentiated coefficients. Models for cows with CNS isolated at both S1 and S2 showed increased resistance against cephalothin oxacillin and ceftiofur in cows that received DCT from the same drug class or a class with a shared resistance mechanism. In contrast resistance of CNS isolates to tetracycline were associated with any AMD therapy at dry off. Resistance of CNS isolates to Penicillin decreased in CNS isolates in cows that received any AMD therapy at dry off compared to those that didnt. The study provided evidence that dry-cow IMM AMD was associated with AMR post-calving.",

Here we study a model for frictional sliding with long-range interactions and recurrent damage that is parameterized by a process of damage and partial healing during sliding. We introduce a failure threshold weakening parameter into the cellular automaton slider-block model which allows blocks to fail at a reduced failure threshold for all subsequent failures during an event. We show that a critical point is reached beyond which the probability of a system-wide event scales with this weakening parameter. We provide a mapping to the percolation transition and show that the values of the scaling exponents approach the values for mean-field percolation spinodal nucleation as lattice size L is increased for fixed R. We also examine the effect of the weakening parameter on the frequencymagnitude scaling relationship and the ergodic behavior of the model. 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In the present study Pb2 cleavage patterns were identified for ribonuclease P RNAs from three phylogenetically disparate organisms Escherichia coli Chromatium vinosum Bacillus subtilis and for E. coli RNase P RNAs that had been altered by deletions. Each of the native RNAs undergoes cleavage at several sites in the core structure that is common to all bacterial RNase P RNAs. All the cleavages occur in non-paired regions of the secondary structure models of the RNAs in regions likely to be involved in tertiary interactions. Two cleavage sites occur at homologous positions in all the native RNAs regardless of sequence variation suggesting common tertiary structural features. The Pb2 cleavage sites in four deletion mutants of E. coli RNase P RNA differed from the native pattern indicating alterations in the tertiary structures of the mutant RNAs. This conclusion is consistent with previously characterized properties of the mutant RNAs. The Pb2 cleavage assay is thus a useful probe to reveal alteration of tertiary structure in RNase P RNA.",

DESIGN Nonconcurrent prospective study data obtained by medical records review. SETTING Public university teaching hospital designated a level I trauma center. SUBJECTS Two hundred fifty persons first hospitalized for firearm injuries at UC Davis Medical Center Sacramento between January 1 1984 and June 30 1985 and followed by medical records review to June 30 1989. RESULTS The aggregate hospital charge for 250 firearm injuries exclusive of professional fees was 3745496 of which 80 was borne directly or indirectly by public funds. The charge for initial hospitalizations was 3297506. Mean and median initial charges per case were 13190 and 5996 respectively range 787-494152. The five patients with charges over 100000 accounted for 33 of all charges 36 of all patient days were attributable to the eight patients with hospitalizations lasting more than 30 days. Thirty-one patients were rehospitalized a total of 71 times charges for rehospitalization totaled 447990. Three fourths of all charges resulted from handgun injuries. CONCLUSIONS The costs for hospital treatment of firearm injuries are substantial. Avoiding prolonged hospitalization may be helpful in controlling these costs but will be difficult to achieve. Primary prevention of firearm injuries may be the most effective cost-control measure.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND As nonmotile organisms plants must rapidly adapt to ever-changing environmental conditions including those caused by daily lightdark cycles. One important mechanism for anticipating and preparing for such predictable changes is the circadian clock. Nearly all organisms have circadian oscillators that when they are in phase with the Earths rotation provide a competitive advantage. In order to understand how circadian clocks benefit plants it is necessary to identify the pathways and processes that are clock controlled. RESULTS We have integrated information from multiple circadian microarray experiments performed on Arabidopsis thaliana in order to better estimate the fraction of the plant transcriptome that is circadian regulated. Analyzing the promoters of clock-controlled genes we identified circadian clock regulatory elements correlated with phase-specific transcript accumulation. We have also identified several physiological pathways enriched for clock-regulated changes in transcript abundance suggesting they may be modulated by the circadian clock. CONCLUSION Our analysis suggests that transcript abundance of roughly one-third of expressed A. thaliana genes is circadian regulated. We found four promoter elements enriched in the promoters of genes with four discrete phases which may contribute to the time-of-day specific changes in the transcript abundance of these genes. Clock-regulated genes are over-represented among all of the classical plant hormone and multiple stress response pathways suggesting that all of these pathways are influenced by the circadian clock. Further exploration of the links between the clock and these pathways will lead to a better understanding of how the circadian clock affects plant growth and leads to improved fitness.",

    "abstract": "Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles PHEVs are proposed as both a near-term technology to achieve energy and environmental goals and as a transitional step toward viable all-electric vehicles. To replace assumptions with observations of potential PHEV drivers behavior in market and impact analyses an Internet-based survey of 2373 new-car-buying households in the United States was conducted. The instrument required households to answer questions complete a driving and parking diary and then complete several PHEV design exercises. Three conclusions could be drawn from the resulting data. First at least half of the target population is already equipped for at-home vehicle recharging but has little opportunity for recharging at the workplace or other locations. Second the study found that the respondents had widely varied interests in four possible PHEV attributes fuel economy in both charge-depleting and charge-sustaining operations blended versus all-electric operation the distance over which the vehicle is in the charge-depleting mode and the recharging speed. Nevertheless the appeal of increased fuel economy appears to be the highest and that of faster recharging appears to be the lowest. Furthermore there is little interest in all-electric operation. Third given the previous two points it was estimated that about a third of the target population has both the infrastructure to recharge a PHEV and interest in a vehicle with plug-in capabilities. Policy technology and energy providers may use this information to understand whether their plans designs and goals align with these present understandings or whether it would be collectively beneficial to foster new understandings of PHEVs among U.S. car buyers.",

    "abstract": "The decision to intubate acute burn patients is often based on the presence of classic clinical exam findings. However these findings may have poor correlation with airway injury and result in unnecessary intubation. We investigated flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy FFL as a means to diagnose upper airway thermal and inhalation injury and guide airway management. A retrospective chart review of all burn patients who underwent FFL from 2013 to 2017 was performed. Their charts were reviewed to determine the indications for FFL including the historical data and physical exam findings that indicated airway injury as well as patient age TBSA type and depth of burn injury carboxyhemoglobin level and clinical course. Fifty-one patients underwent FFL with an average TBSA of 6.5 range 0.5-38.0 and carboxyhemoglobin level of 3.5. Burn mechanism was flame 35.3 or flash 51.0 with 50 occurring in enclosed spaces. In all cases the decision to perform FFL was based on physical exam findings meeting criteria for intubation including facial burns singed nasal hairs nasal soot voice change throat pain or abnormal sensation shortness of breath carbonaceous sputum wheezing or stridor. Based on FFL 9 patients 17.7 were treated with steroids 28 patients 54.9 received supportive care and 6 patients 11.8 had repeat FFL for monitoring. One patient was intubated after repeat FFL examination. All patients who underwent FFL met traditional criteria for intubation based on exam however 98 were monitored without issues based on FFL findings. FFL is a valuable tool that can lead to fewer intubations in acute burn patients with a stable respiratory status for whom history and physical exam suggest upper airway injury.",

In the Landslide sandpile model all the grains at a vertex topple at once and here we prove formulas for all eigenvalues their multiplicities and the rate of convergence to stationarity. The proofs use wreath products and the representation theory of monoids.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized clinical trial. ANIMALS Female dogs n30. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 methods for achieving ovarian pedicle hemostasis during LAOVH extracorporeal modified Roeder knot application suture group metal clip application using a multifire 10 mm laparoscopic clip applier clip group or use of a novel 5 mm bipolar vessel-sealing device vessel-sealing group. In all dogs a 3 median portal technique was used. RESULTS Controlling for the dogs bodyweights there was a significant association between surgical time and which method for hemostasis was used. This association was different when comparing the first 5 procedures using each method to the second 5. For a 20 kg dog the surgical time 95 CI for the first 5 procedures was 80 69-91 68 57-79 and 33 21-45 minutes for the suture clip and vessel-sealing groups respectively. For the second 5 procedures surgical time was 71 60-81 50 39-60 and 40 29-51 minutes. Pedicle hemorrhage occurred in all dogs in the clip group 3 dogs in the suture group and none of the dogs in the vessel-sealing group although in all cases was considered hemodynamically inconsequential. All dogs recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSIONS All methods of hemostasis were safe for pedicle sectioning. A learning curve exists for clip and suture methods. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Use of a vessel-sealing device significantly shortens surgical time and provides excellent hemostasis during LAOVH.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Stereotactic body radiation therapy SBRT has emerged as a standard treatment of early-stage medically inoperable lung cancer. Limited data have evaluated the radiation pneumonitis RP risk with SBRT after previous anatomic lung resection ALR. We assessed the incidence of RP and all pulmonary toxicity PT in patients who underwent lung SBRT after ALR and compared them with those of patients without previous ALR. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 84 consecutively treated patients with stage T1-T2b non-small-cell lung cancer NSCLC treated with 88 courses of SBRT for 94 lung tumors from January 2007 to December 2014 including 17 patients with previous ALR. The rates of RP and all PT were compared between the patients with and without previous ALR. RESULTS At a median follow-up duration of 18.3 months range 1.8-85.6 months the crude grade 2 RP rate was 5.9 and 2.8 for patients with and without previous ALR respectively P .51. The corresponding 2-year estimates of freedom from RP were 89 and 97 P .51. The crude rate of all grade 2 PT was 11.8 and 2.8 for those with and without previous ALR P .11 with 2-year estimates of freedom from PT of 97 and 84 P .11 respectively. The 2 cohorts were well matched by the mean lung dose percentage of lung volume receiving 20 Gy P .86 and prescribed dose P .75. The 2-year estimates of local control cause-specific survival and overall survival were similar between the 2 cohorts. CONCLUSION The observed rates of PT were low among all patients with a trend toward increased grade 2 and 3 lung toxicity among patients with previous ALR. Previous ALR did not increase the risk of grade 4 and 5 RP and SBRT appears safe and effective in this population.",

It is hypothesised that youth are involved in ATV-related incidents because they cannot effectively activate the vehicles controls. This study evaluated potential discrepancies between the required activation forces of the controls of fifty-four utility ATVs and the strength of male-and-female youth of varying ages 6-20 years old and strength percentiles 5th 50th and 95th. The activation forces of the ATVs controls were measured experimentally while the youths corresponding strength was retrieved from the literature. The results of this study demonstrated a physical mismatch between the forces required to operate ATV controls and youths strength. Turning the handlebar pressing the footbrake and pushing the ATV off are the most difficult tasks for ATV operation. These discrepancies compromise the youths ability to ride ATVs increasing their risk of crashes. Practitioner summary Previous studies indicate that some youth engage in ATV incidents because they cannot activate the vehicles controls. We measured the forces required to operate eight ATV controls and compared them with the youths corresponding strength. Our results demonstrated physical mismatches between the forces required to operate ATV controls and the youths strength.",

    "abstract": "Across the United States cities are creating sustainability and climate action plans CAPs that call to increase local vegetation. These greening initiatives have the potential to not only benefit the environment but also human health. In epidemiologic literature greenness has a protective effect on mortality through various direct and indirect pathways. We aimed to assess how an increase in greenness could decrease mortality in the largest urban areas in the United States. We conducted a nationwide quantitative health impact assessment to estimate the predicted reduction in mortality associated with an increase in greenness across two decades 2000 2010 and 2019. Using a recently published exposure-response function Landsat 30 m 16-day satellite imagery from April to September and publicly available county-level mortality data from the CDC we calculated the age-adjusted reduction in all-cause mortality for those 65 years and older within 35 of the most populated metropolitan areas. We estimated that between 34000 and 38000 all-cause deaths could have been reduced in 2000 2010 and 2019 with a local increase in green vegetation by 0.1 unit across the most populated metropolitan areas. We found that overall greenness increased across time with a 2.86 increase from 2000 to 2010 to 11.11 from 2010 to 2019. These results can be used to support CAPs by providing a quantitative assessment to the impact local greening initiatives can have on mortality. Urban planners and local governments can use these findings to calculate the co-benefits of local CAPs through a public health lens and support policy development.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-five consecutive patients who underwent MDCT for suspected urolithiasis were included. Two radiologists independently determined the number of stones on 5- 3- and 1.25-mm axial 5- and 3-mm coronal and 5-mm coronal MIP images. The reference standard was obtained by consensus review using all six datasets. Stone density was determined for all calculi 4 mm or larger on all datasets. RESULTS There were a total of 115 stones. Reader 1 identified 111 96.5 112 97.4 97 84.3 102 88.7 99 86.1 and 85 73.9 stones and reader 2 identified 105 91.3 102 88.7 85 73.9 89 77.4 89 77.4 and 76 66.1 stones on the MIP 1.25-mm axial 3-mm axial 3-mm coronal 5-mm coronal and 5-mm axial images respectively. Both readers identified more stones on the MIP images than on the 3- or 5-mm axial or coronal images p 0.0001. The mean difference in stone attenuation compared with the thin axial images was significantly less for the MIP images 44.6 HU compared with 3-mm axial 235 HU 3-mm coronal 309 HU and 5-mm coronal 329.6 HU or axial images 347.8 HU p 0.0001. CONCLUSION Coronal MIP reformations allow more accurate identification and density measurements of urinary tract stones compared with routine axial and coronal reformations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Transcarotid artery revascularization TCAR is a novel hybrid approach to treating carotid disease in the treatment of stroke and stroke prevention. Early results of this hybrid approach to carotid stenting using flow reversal have been promising with reported stroke rates around 1-2.8.12 Currently carotid stenting regardless of approach is performed with uncovered stents which incurs the risk of plaque protrusion through the stent and in-stent restenosis. Overall plaque protrusion is a rare event with a reported incidence of 2.8 on angiography but it is associated a high rate of ischemic complications up to 66.7.3 The use of covered stents could eliminate the risk of plaque protrusion and therefore short to midterm embolic phenomenon during the remodeling process. It also may improve rates of in-stent restenosis as it is a fully covered stent. Adoption of this technique has the potential to further improve the safety efficacy and durability of TCAR. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing TCAR with covered stents between September 2018 and December 2019. Procedures were performed by the same operator at 2 separate institutions. Indications included severe asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid stenosis with high-risk lesions defined as lesions 2 cm lesions or longer andor 50 of the lesion containing soft plaque or bleeding carotid pseudoaneurysm. Our primary outcomes included periprocedural and 30-day stroke rates. Secondary outcomes included stent patency and other procedure-related complications. All patients were maintained on clopidogrel postprocedure for 3 months and then transitioned to aspirin unless otherwise indicated. RESULTS A total of 6 patients underwent TCAR with covered stent angioplasty during this time period. Patient demographics included 5 males and 1 female with an average age of 70.8 4.6 years. Indications for stenting included 4 patients with asymptomatic 70 carotid stenosis and 1 patient with transient ischemic attack-like symptoms and 70 stenosis and 1 patient with bleeding carotid pseudoaneurysm. Gore Viabahn covered stents were used in all patients. There were no periprocedural or postprocedural ischemic events at 30 days. All 6 stents remained patent at follow-up on duplex ultrasound and all patients remained asymptomatic on clinical follow-up average 3.4 1.4-6.9 months. CONCLUSIONS The use of covered stents for TCAR appears to be a safe and effective in select patients requiring carotid intervention. It holds the potential to decrease ischemic events from plaque protrusion and in-stent restenosis in the long-term. Further investigation in device design or clinical evaluation is warranted.",

However LSCs have not yet been identified for acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL. Among many challenges lack of phenotypic markers is one of the major problems in identifying ALL LSCs. In this study we demonstrated a novel method to isolate LSCs from both T- and B- cell ALLs and further characterized their transcriptome profile at the single cell level.jatsp jatspWe have recently identified a novel method to isolate ALL LSCs based on cellular metabolic activities. We demonstrated that these isolated LSCs had in vivo leukemia-initiating capability LIC. We have developed a series of primary ALL xenograft mouse models using patient samples and NODSCIDIL2Rg-- NSG mice. Leukemia cells harvested from several generations of these mice were used in this study. We isolated LSCs and non-LSCs from 4 different B-cell type ALL samples and transplanted them separately into healthy NSG mice. Cell numbers used varied between 5 10 and 50000 per mouse and the number of the animals varied between three and eight per group. All the animals transplanted with LSCs developed leukemia between 5-14 weeks whereas those transplanted with non-LSCs did not develop the disease within the same timeframe or by the end of the study which was more than 4 months after leukemia development in the LSC group.jatsp jatspIn order to characterize and identify potential therapeutic targets in the LSCs we investigated the transcriptome profile of these cells. First we performed genomewide microarray gene expression profiling of RNA isolated from the LSCs and non-LSCs using 4 ALL cell lines Reh JM1 Jurkat and Molt4. There were 173 genes which showed at least 2-fold difference in gene expression between the LSCs and non-LSCs. Using a panel of primer sets for the 100 genes exhibiting the highest difference in expression we performed qRT-PCR for these genes in the isolated LSCs and non-LSCs from 11 primary ALL samples 10 B-cell and 1 T-cell type transplanted and harvested from our NSG xenograft mouse models at different generations. There was a distinct difference in the transcriptome profile between the LSCs and non-LSCs in these primary ALL samples. Overall gene expression of 93 LSC signature genes was much lower in the LSCs than in the non-LSCs.jatsp jatspRecent advances in microfluidic technologies allowed us to investigate cells at single cell resolution. Growing evidence suggests that cancer stem cells consist of heterogeneous cell populations subclones. Therefore we further investigated whether these isolated LSCs have subclones using the Fluidigm C1 and Biomark system. Preliminary results using a primary ALL sample harvested from our xenograft mouse model indicate that there are at least two distinct subclones in the LSCs based on principal component analysis of the single cell data.jatsp jatspIn summary we 1 developed a novel method to isolate ALL LSCs which have in vivo LIC 2 demonstrated that isolated LSCs have a distinct transcriptome profile and 3 discovered that the LSCs seem to consist of subclones. Currently we are in the process of performing detailed comprehensive transcriptome analyses and additional single cell transcriptome assays.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

Animals were divided into five groups and treated for 6 hours with either crystalloid control group or mannitol albumin furosemide or albuminfurosemide treatment groups. The cerebral effects of therapy were evaluated by intracranial pressure ICP measurements and by postmortem evaluations of water content using computerized tomography CT density measurements and wet-dry weight measurements. The ICP was significantly reduced by all treatments except albumin alone and was reduced equally by mannitol furosemide and albuminfurosemide. The CT density of the lesion area was significantly increased by all treatments. The density of the contralateral nonlesioned hemisphere was significantly increased by all treatments except albumin. The water content of the lesion area was significantly decreased by all treatments water content of the opposite hemisphere was not significantly reduced. The systemic effects of therapy were evaluated by measuring net fluid balance wedge pressures hematocrits free water clearance and vasopressin. Negative fluid balance without an increase in hematocrit or in vasopressin secretion occurred only in dogs treated with albuminfurosemide. Such oncodiuretic therapy seems to cause normovolemic dehydration and to have cerebral effects similar to mannitol and furosemide without their undesirable systemic effects.",

In recent years research in this area has begun to quantify greenhouse gas GHG emission sources from beef and dairy cattle production systems and develop initial mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions without compromising animal productivity. Developing an in-depth and accurate understanding of GHG emission sources from these cattle systems is challenging because of the variability across farms ranches and feedlots and the variation between animal types on individual operations. Emission sources can be distinguished into two main categories enteric fermentation and manure. However to fully quantify all GHG emission sources from the beef and dairy production systems a Life Cycle Assessment LCA should be completed that includes all emission sources from cradle to fork. Included in this assessment would be GHG sources associated with animal management emissions during processing and emissions associated with transportation of the finished product to the consumer. This chapter focuses on GHG emissions from the dairy and beef production systems derived from enteric fermentation and manure. 2011 American Chemical Society.",

Patients often present with right-sided heart failure as the pericardium thickens and impedes cardiac filling. Pericardiectomy is the treatment of choice for improving hemodynamics in CP patients however the procedure carries a high morbidity and mortality and the anesthetic management can be challenging. Acute heart failure bleeding and arrhythmias are all concerns postoperatively. METHODS After IRB approval we performed the retrospective analysis of 66 consecutive patients with CP who underwent pericardiectomy from July 2018 to May 2022. RESULTS Most patients had significant preoperative comorbidities including congestive hepatopathy 75.76 New York Heart Association Type IIIIV heart failure 59.09 and atrial fibrillation 51.52. Despite this 75.76 of patients were extubated within the first 24 h and all but 2 of the patients survived to discharge 96.97. CONCLUSIONS Anesthetic management including a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of CP the use of advanced monitoring and transesophageal echocardiography TEE guidance all played an important role in patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The sedimentology stratigraphic position and benthic foraminiferal biostratigraphy of early- to mid-Holocene deposits from the west-central Florida shelf suggest that barrier islands developed along this coast as early as 8.3 ka in an environment that was more arid than today. Predominant foraminifera of three paralic sedimentary facies deposited between 5.3 and 8.3 ka include miliolids Elphidium spp. and Ammonia spp. all of which are common in back-barrier environments. Foraminiferal assemblages also suggest that early back-barrier sediments were deposited in a hypersaline environment similar to that of the arid Laguna Madre of the western Gulf of Mexico. Modern back-barrier foraminifera in the Tampa Bay region are indicative of the humid subtropical climate of today. Thus the climate of west-central Florida at approximately 8 ka was more arid than today which is consistent with recent studies showing that climate in the Gulf of Mexico was dryer and cooler during this time period. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "Our computational developments and analyses on experimental images are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of chemical spraying via unmanned aerial vehicle UAV. Our evaluations are in accord with the two perspectives of color-complexity color variety within a color system and color distributional geometry on an image. First by working within RGB and HSV color systems we develop a new color-identification algorithm relying on highly associative relations among three color-coordinates to lead us to exhaustively identify all targeted color-pixels. A color-dot is then identified as one isolated network of connected color-pixel. All identified color-dots vary in shapes and sizes within each image. Such a pixel-based computing algorithm is shown robustly and efficiently accommodating heterogeneity due to shaded regions and lighting conditions. Secondly all color-dots with varying sizes are categorized into three categories. Since the number of small color-dot is rather large we spatially divide the entire image into a 2D lattice of rectangular. As such each rectangle becomes a collective of color-dots of various sizes and is classified with respect to its color-dots intensity. We progressively construct a series of minimum spanning trees MST as multiscale 2D distributional spatial geometries in a decreasing-intensity fashion. We extract the distributions of distances among connected rectangle-nodes in the observed MST and simulated MSTs generated under the spatial uniformness assumption. We devise a new algorithm for testing 2D spatial uniformness based on a Hierarchical clustering tree upon all involving MSTs. This new tree-based p-value evaluation has the capacity to become exact.",

METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the imaging and clinical data of four males and one female 3 to 72 years old with rhinocerebral mucormycosis. RESULTS All the patients presented with sinusitis and ophthalmological symptoms. Most of the patients 80 had isointense lesions relative to brain in T1-weighted images. The signal intensity in T2-weighted images was more variable with only one 20 patient showing hyperintensity. A pattern of anatomic involvement affecting the nasal cavity maxillary sinus orbit and ethmoid cells was consistently observed in all five patients 100. Our series demonstrated a mortality rate of 60. CONCLUSION Progressive and rapid involvement of the cavernous sinus vascular structures and intracranial contents is the usual evolution of rhinocerebral mucormycosis. In the context of immunosupression a pattern of nasal cavity maxillary sinus ethmoid cells and orbit inflammatory lesions should prompt the diagnosis of mucormycosis. Multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging shows anatomic involvement helping in surgery planning. However the prognosis is grave despite radical surgery and antifungals.",

Rabbits were fed regular rabbit chow or a diet containing 10 ground flaxseed that is highly enriched with the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid ALA. The high-flaxseed diet resulted in an incorporation of ALA in all tissues but mostly in the heart and liver with little in the brain. Docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid levels were also selectively increased in some tissues and the effects were not as large as ALA. Arachidonic acid and the ratio of omega-6omega-3 fatty acids were decreased in all tissues obtained from the flax-supplemented group.

METHODS A thorough ophthalmic examination including fundus examination and electroretinography was performed and blood samples were collected from all participating members. Genomic DNA was extracted and genome-wide linkage andor exclusion analyses were completed with fluorescently labeled short tandem repeat microsatellite markers. Two-point Lod scores were calculated and coding exons along with exon-intron boundaries of RPE65 gene were sequenced bidirectionally. RESULTS Ophthalmic examinations of the patients affected in all three families suggested retinal dystrophy with an early most probably congenital onset. Genome-wide linkage andor exclusion analyses localized the critical interval in all three families to chromosome 1p31 harboring RPE65. Bidirectional sequencing of RPE65 identified a splice acceptor site variation in intron 2 c.95-1GA a single base substitution in exon 3 c.179TC and a single base deletion in exon 5 c.361delT in the three families respectively. All three variations segregated with the disease phenotype in their respective families and were absent from ethnically matched control chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS These results strongly suggest that causal mutations in RPE65 are responsible for retinal dystrophy in the affected individuals of these consanguineous Pakistani families.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane TPTM is often encountered in primary care or in the emergency department ED. Several therapeutic interventions have been described but conservative follow-up until spontaneous complete recovery is the most common choice. OBJECTIVE Our goal was to analyze the trauma mechanism perforation characteristics and outcome of patients with TPTM. METHODS The study included patients examined in the ED of a tertiary university-affiliated medical center because of TPTM between 2012 and 2016. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics trauma mechanism clinical characteristics and outcome. A phone survey was performed to obtain the missing information of all the patients who did not continue their follow-up in our outpatient clinic. RESULTS We reviewed the histories of 80 patients with a mean age of 26.7 14.6 years 20 children 25. TPTM was caused by blunt trauma in 45 patients 56 and penetrating trauma in 35 patients 44. Thirty-five patients 44 completed their follow-up in the hospital outpatient clinic with a mean duration of 6.2 weeks. Twenty-five patients 38 completed their follow-up in a community-based otolaryngology clinic 6 patients 9 chose not to complete their follow-up and 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 60 patients who completed follow-up 56 patients recovered spontaneously 3 patients underwent successful tympanoplasty and 1 patient was referred to surgery but was lost to follow-up. All children healed spontaneously. CONCLUSION TPTM was more common in young males with main mechanisms of blunt trauma an assault or cleaning the ear canal. All children demonstrated complete spontaneous recovery.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Flank pain associated with stone disease is typically caused by a stone that obstructs urine flow. However it is plausible that nonobstructing kidney stones may still cause pain. We performed a multicenter observational trial to evaluate whether treatment of small nonobstructing calyceal stones improves pain and kidney stone-specific health-related quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients aged 18 years or older with nonobstructing renal stones up to 10 mm in longest diameter and moderate to severe pain were recruited. All participants completed 3 questionnaires the Brief Pain Inventory BPI the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System pain interference form 6a and the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire. Thereafter all participants underwent ureteroscopy for renal stone treatment. All 3 questionnaires were repeated at 2 6 to 8 and at 12 weeks postprocedure. The primary outcomes were change in preoperative to 12-week postoperative mean BPI score and worst BPI pain score. RESULTS A total of 43 patients with nonobstructing kidney stones and associated flank pain were recruited. All stones were removed. Preoperatively BPI scores for mean pain and worst pain were 5.5 and 7.2 respectively which decreased to 1.8 and 2.8 respectively at 12 weeks postoperatively. Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire mean score increased from 70.4 to 115.3 at 12 weeks postoperatively. A total of 86 and 69 of patients had at least a 20 and 50 reduction in their mean pain scores respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study determined that patients benefit significantly from the removal of calyceal nonobstructing kidney stones for at least 12 weeks with a reduction in pain and an increase in quality of life. Therefore surgical removal of these stones in this patient population should be offered as a treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Numerous wildlife species are known pests of California agriculture. Effective management of these pests is required to maximize agricultural production yet it is unclear how the importance of various wildlife pest species and associated management strategies may vary regionally throughout California. Accounting for these regional differences should yield management programs that are specifically tailored to the regions constituents and should be considered when managing wildlife pests at a more localized level. Therefore we developed a survey to provide quantitative data on regional differences in research and management needs to better guide future research efforts in developing more effective practical and appropriate methods for managing wildlife pests. We found that coyotes were a more common pest in the mountain region ground squirrels were a greater concern in the central and desert valley region while birds were most commonly listed as pests by individuals working in multiple regions of California. Coyote damage varied regionally with livestock depredation the greatest concern throughout most of California although damage to irrigation tubing and sprinklers was of equal concern in the central and desert valley region. For bird pests exclusionary devices were the most common and most effective methods of control in the coastal region. Frightening devices were the most commonly used method for bird control in all other regions although the efficacy associated with frightening devices was considered far lower than their level of use suggesting that better management options are needed for bird control in these regions. For all wildlife pests nonlethal control options e.g. exclusionary devices habitat modification were generally preferred in the coastal region while lethal removal options ranked higher in the central and desert valley region e.g. baiting burrow fumigation. Efficacy was considered the most important attribute of a control method for all regions while Integrated Pest Management programs were considered the most effective method for controlling wildlife pests in all regions except for the central and desert valley region. Collectively the importance of wildlife pests and the perception of associated control methods varied throughout California and reflects the need to consider these regional differences in order to optimize damage management strategies at the regional level. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The quality of structure models produced in the CASP5 experiment has been compared with that in earlier CASPs. The most significant progress is in the fold recognition regime where the development of meta-servers has allowed more accurate consensus models to be generated. In contrast to this there is little evidence of progress in producing more accurate comparative models particularly those based on sequence identities 30. For comparative models based on low-sequence identity and for fold recognition models accuracy depends primarily on the fraction of the target structure that is similar to an available template and the quality of the alignment. Overall these results indicate that there are still no effective methods of improving model quality beyond that obtained by successfully copying a template structure. For models of proteins with previously unknown folds there appears to be a pause in the previous consistent improvement. There is some evidence that more groups are producing top-quality models however. Although specific progress between successive experiments is sometimes difficulty to identify over the history of all the CASPs there has been steady if sometimes slow progress in all modeling regimes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Coagulopathy is present in 25 to 38 of trauma patients on arrival to the hospital and these patients are four times more likely to die than trauma patients without coagulopathy. Recently a high ratio of fresh frozen plasma FFP to packed red blood cells PRBCs has been shown to decrease mortality in massively transfused trauma patients. Therefore we hypothesized that patients with elevated International Normalized Ratio INR on arrival to the hospital may benefit more from transfusion with a high ratio of FFPPRBC than those with a lower INR. METHODS Retrospective multicenter cohort study of 437 massively transfused trauma patients was conducted to determine whether the effect of the ratio of FFPPRBC on death at 24 hours is modified by a patients admission INR on arrival to the hospital. Contingency tables and logistic regression were used. RESULTS Trauma patients who arrived to the hospital with an elevated INR had a greater risk of death than those with a lower INR. However as the ratio of FFPPRBC transfused increased mortality decreased similarly between the INR quartiles. CONCLUSIONS The mortality benefit from a high FFPPRBC ratio is similar for all massively transfused trauma patients. This is contrary to the current belief that only coagulopathic trauma patients benefit from a high FFPPRBC ratio. Furthermore it is unnecessary to determine whether INR is elevated before transfusing a high FFPPRBC ratio. Future studies are needed to determine the mechanism by which a high FFPPRBC ratio decreases mortality in all massively transfused trauma patients.",

SETTING Academic and commercial veterinary blood banks. ANIMALS Non-Greyhounds from community-based blood donor program and Greyhounds from a blood bank colony. INTERVENTION Blood was collected from all dogs via direct venipuncture for a complete hemogram biochemistry and point-of-care viscoelastic coagulation. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS All biochemical measurements for all dogs in Group NG n 38 non-Greyhounds and Group G n 53 Greyhounds were within local reference intervals. Hematology data showed significant statistical differences between groups in hemoglobin RBC platelet and WBC concentrations. Group G demonstrated lower maximum clot firmness MCF with 17 VCM units 26 VCM units in Group NG increased lysis with 30 VCM units at 30 minutes LI30 and 27 VCM units at 45 minutes LI45 86 VCM units LI30 and 85 VCM units LI45 in Group NG and decreased amplitude of 13 VCM units 10 minutes A10 after clot time CT and 6 VCM units 20 minutes after CT A20 18 VCM units A10 and 22 VCM units A20 in Group NG. CONCLUSION This study found differences between healthy Greyhound and non-Greyhound blood donors in measures of clot strength and fibrinolysis as measured by the VCM. Whereas Greyhound have unique hematologic and hemostatic profiles these measured viscoelastic differences are important to note prior to and following surgical intervention to aid in clinical decision-making if bleeding complications develop.",

METHODS Fiscal year 2007-2008 to 2009-2010 coding and work relative value unit data from the University Health System Consortium and Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Practice Solutions Center database which includes 86 academic institutions was analyzed. Procedural groups for pneumonectomy other pulmonary resection including lobectomy bilobectomy segmentectomy sleeve lobectomy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy-segmentectomy and esophagectomy were evaluated. RESULTS Of the 1989055.3 total work relative value units generated for complex noncardiac thoracic surgical procedures during the study period 77.5 were generated by GTS compared with 9.9 by CS 8.9 by general surgeons and 3.7 by surgical oncologists p0.001. General thoracic surgeons averaged 2.1 pneumonectomies 51.1 other pulmonary resections and 12.2 esophagectomies per year compared with 2.1 pneumonectomies 9.4 other pulmonary resections and less than 1 esophagectomy per year for CS. General surgeons and surgical oncologists averaged no more than 1.6 cases per year for all categories all p0.001 except for pneumonectomy in which GTS versus CS was not significantly different. To determine the use of parenchymal-sparing operations we looked at the ratio of sleeve lobectomy to pneumonectomy and found higher usage of parenchymal-sparing techniques by GTS relative to pneumonectomy compared with all other groups p0.001. General thoracic surgeons averaged 16.0 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomies per year compared with approximately 1 per year for all other groups p0.001. General thoracic surgeons had a 47.1 increase in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomies per year compared with 27.4 for CS. CONCLUSIONS In academic hospitals noncardiac thoracic surgery is performed mostly by GTS supporting academic GTS as a distinct specialty. These results may help determine hospital referral and credentialing policies and plan general and cardiothoracic surgery residency curriculum.",

A novel transdermal patch providing a rapid pulse delivery of TPTD may provide a desirable alternative. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel transdermal TPTD patch compared to placebo patch and sc TPTD 20-microg injection in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. DESIGN Our study consisted of 6-month randomized placebo-controlled positive control multidose daily administration. PATIENTS We enrolled 165 postmenopausal women mean age 64 yr with osteoporosis. INTERVENTIONS A TPTD patch with a 20- 30- or 40-microg dose or a placebo patch was self-administered daily for 30-min wear time or 20 microg of TPTD was injected daily. OUTCOMES The primary efficacy measure was mean percentage change in lumbar spine bone mineral density BMD from baseline at 6 months. RESULTS TPTD delivered by transdermal patch significantly increased lumbar spine BMD vs. placebo patch in a dose-dependent manner at 6 months P 0.001. TPTD 40-microg patch increased total hip BMD compared to both placebo patch and TPTD injection P 0.05. Bone turnover markers procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen increased from baseline in a dose-dependent manner in all treatment groups and were all significantly different from placebo patch P 0.001. All treatments were well tolerated and no prolonged hypercalcemia was observed. CONCLUSION Transdermal patch delivery of TPTD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis for 6 months is safe and effective in increasing lumbar spine and total hip BMD.",

    "abstract": "All fields of biology have been greatly influenced by the generation of complete genome assemblies. This impact is most apparent with the findings and resulting applications from the Human Genome Project which has transformed biomedical science. Hoping for a similar transformation in agriculture a genome assembly was made first for chicken in 2004. More recently as the feasibility and economics of generating a genome assembly increased the number of species across all avian orders has increased dramatically e.g. 48 were produced and analyzed in the landmark paper which strongly suggests that the field of genomics will only grow in its ability to shape the future direction for all fields of avian biology.",

    "abstract": "During early brain development the axis of division of neuronal precursor cells is regulated tightly and can determine whether neurons remain in the germinal layers or migrate away. Directed neuronal migration depends on the establishment of cell polarity and cells are polarized dynamically in response to extracellular signals. Endogenous electric fields EFs orient cell division and direct migration of a variety of cell types. Here we show that cell division of cultured hippocampal cells neuron-like cells and glial-like cells is oriented strikingly by an applied EF which also directs neuronal migration. Directed migration involves polarization of the leading neurite of the microtubule-associated protein MAP-2 and of the Golgi apparatus and the centrosome all of which reposition asymmetrically to face the cathode. Pharmacological inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinases ROCK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase decreased leading neurite orientation and Golgi polarization in the neurons in response to an EF and in parallel decreased the directedness of EF-guided neuronal migration. This work demonstrates that the axis of hippocampal cell division the establishment of neuronal polarity the polarization of intracellular structures and the direction of neuronal migration are all regulated by an extracellular electrical cue.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To compare the utility of keratometry vs total keratometry TK for intraocular lens power calculations in eyes with keratoconus KCN using KCN and non-KCN formulae. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS This study was conducted at 2 academic centers and included 87 eyes in 67 patients who underwent cataract surgery between 2019 and 2021. Biometry measurements were obtained using a swept-source optical coherence tomography biometer IOL Master 700. Refractive prediction errors including root mean square error RMSE were calculated for 13 formulae. These included 4 classical formulae Haigis Hoffer Q Holladay 1 H1 and SRKT 5 new formulae NF Barrett Universal II BU2 Cooke K6 EVO 2.0 Kane and Pearl-DGS 3 KCN formulae BU2 KCN M-PCA BU2 KCN P-PCA and Kane KCN and H1 with equivalent keratometry reading values H1-EKR. Formulae were ranked by RMSE. Friedman analysis of variance with post hoc analysis and H-testing was used for statistical significance testing. RESULTS KCN formulae had the lowest RMSEs in all eyes and BU2 KCNM-PCA performed the best among KCN formulae in all subgroups. In eyes with severe KCN if TK values are unavailable the BU2 KCN P-PCA performed better than the top-ranked non-KCN formula SRKT. In eyes with nonsevere KCN if TK values are unavailable EVO 2.0 K was statistically superior to the next competitor Kane K. H1-EKR had the highest RMSE. CONCLUSIONS KCN formulae and TK are useful for intraocular lens power calculations in KCN eyes especially in eyes with severe KCN. The BU2 KCN M-PCA using TK values performed best for eyes with all severities of KCN. For eyes with nonsevere KCN the EVO 2.0 TK or K can also be used.",

    "abstract": "Spiny-rayed fishes Acanthomorpha dominate modern marine habitats and account for more than a quarter of all living vertebrate species. Previous time-calibrated phylogenies and patterns from the fossil record explain this dominance by correlating the origin of major acanthomorph lineages with the Cretaceous-Palaeogene mass extinction. Here we infer a time-calibrated phylogeny using ultraconserved elements that samples 91.4 of all acanthomorph families and investigate patterns of body shape disparity. Our results show that acanthomorph lineages steadily accumulated throughout the Cenozoic and underwent a significant expansion of among-clade morphological disparity several million years after the end-Cretaceous. These acanthomorph lineages radiated into and diversified within distinct regions of morphospace that characterize iconic lineages including fast-swimming open-ocean predators laterally compressed reef fishes bottom-dwelling flatfishes seahorses and pufferfishes. The evolutionary success of spiny-rayed fishes is the culmination of multiple species-rich and phenotypically disparate lineages independently diversifying across the globe under a wide range of ecological conditions.",

Six anthocyanin pigments were identified and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography using photo diode-array detection HPLC-PDA and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry LC-ESIMSMS. The predominant anthocyanins are cyanidin-3-glucoside 572.47 microgg 91.13 of total and peonidin-3-glucoside 29.78 microgg 4.74 of total. Minor constituents included three cyanidin-dihexoside isomers and one cyanidin hexoside. Thermal stability of anthocyanins was assessed in rice cooked using a rice cooker pressure cooker or on a gas range. All cooking methods caused significant P 0.001 decreases in the anthocyanins identified. Pressure cooking resulted in the greatest loss of cyanidin-3-glucoside 79.8 followed by the rice cooker 74.2 and gas range 65.4. Conversely levels of protocatechuic acid increased 2.7 to 3.4 times in response to all cooking methods.

Between January 2014 and December 2017 23 119 cases were recorded in 13 participating institutions of which 88 of patients were 18 years of age and 25 1 year of age a high-severity adverse event occurred in 1193 5.2. Case types were defined by procedures performed and grouped on the basis of association with the outcome high-severity adverse event. Thirty-four unique case types were determined and stratified into 6 risk categories. Six hemodynamic indicator variables were empirically assessed and a novel hemodynamic vulnerability score was determined by the frequency of high-severity adverse events. In a multivariable model case-type risk category odds ratios for category 00.46 11.00 21.40 32.68 43.64 and 55.25 all P0.005 and hemodynamic vulnerability score odds ratio for score 01.00 11.27 21.89 and 32.03 all P0.006 remained independent predictors of patient risk. Conclusions These case-type risk categories and the weighted hemodynamic vulnerability score both serve as independent predictors of patient risk for high-severity adverse events. This contemporary procedure-type risk metric and weighted hemodynamic vulnerability score will improve our understanding of patient and procedural outcomes.",

This change confers an oncology label to neoplasms that are overwhelmingly benign. A comprehensive clinical classification schema is required to guide prognosis therapy and outcomes for all patients with pituitary adenomas. Pituitary adenomas and NETs exhibit some morphological and ultrastructural similarities. However unlike NETs pituitary adenomas are highly prevalent yet indolent and rarely become malignant. This Perspective presents the outcomes of an interdisciplinary international workshop that addressed the merit and clinical implications of the classification change of pituitary adenoma to NET. Many non-histological factors provide mechanistic insight and influence the prognosis and treatment of pituitary adenoma. We recommend the development of a comprehensive classification that integrates clinical genetic biochemical radiological pathological and molecular information for all anterior pituitary neoplasms.",

    "abstract": "The topological transitions that occur to the grain boundary network during grain growth in a material with uniform grain boundary energies are believed to be known. The same is not true for more realistic materials since more general grain boundary energies in principle allow many more viable grain boundary configurations. A simulation of grain growth in such a material therefore requires a procedure to enumerate all possible topological transitions and select the most energetically favorable one. Such a procedure is developed and implemented here for a microstructure represented by a volumetric finite element mesh. As a specific example all possible transitions for a typical configuration with five grains around a junction point are enumerated and some exceptional transitions are found to be energetically similar to the conventional ones even for a uniform boundary energy. A general discrete formulation to calculate grain boundary velocities is used to simulate grain growth for an example microstructure. The method is implemented as a C library based on SCOREC an open source massively parallelizable library for finite element simulations with adaptive meshing.",

PHEV electricity use could be increased through policies supporting non-home recharge opportunities but this increase occurs during daytime hours and could contribute to peak electricity demand.

    "abstract": "Noninvasive genetic surveys often conducted by collecting fecal samples have become a popular tool for surveying wildlife but have primarily been applied to species with large and conspicuous scat. Although many small mammals are threatened endangered or data deficient noninvasive genetic surveys have rarely been applied due to the challenges of detecting their inconspicuous fecal pellets. As part of a broader study of the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse Reithrodontomys raviventris we developed a noninvasive genetic survey technique for the community of small mammals in their putative range. We designed bait stations to passively collect fecal samples from rodents and developed a multiplex primer set that amplified unique fragment sizes for salt marsh harvest mice and four other sympatric species. We tested the primer set on positive controls and on fecal pellets collected from bait stations at two regularly monitored field sites known to have very different densities of salt marsh harvest mice. The multiplex amplified DNA from all five species even when all five species were present in a single sample. A positive species identification was made for all field-collected samples and 43 of these field-collected samples had multispecies detections. The combination of bait stations and genetic species identification proved to be an effective means of noninvasively surveying small mammals in potential salt marsh harvest mouse habitat. The sampling technique should be applicable to a wide variety of small mammals in other systems.",

Individuals were identified that had hypocotyls at least twice as long in the presence of hormonal C2H4 levels 1 l l-1 as wild-type plants. This phenotype was confirmed in M3 seedlings for three independent mutants. The phenotype was normal in terms of growth for the mutant lines so there were no obvious confounding growth defects or effect of other induced mutations. Changes in response to C2H4 and wounding chlorophyll loss induced respiration induced phenylalanine ammonia-lyase PAL activity in mature heads of lettuce were variable among the three mutant lines. Selection for C2H4 insensitivity at the seedling stage did not produce mature plants that were consistently less sensitive to C2H4-induced increases in PAL activity or CO2 production. However all the selected mutated plants did have lower rates of C2H4-induced chlorophyll loss. All of the mutants differed from the wild-type in at least 3 of the 7 phenotypes measured while one line differed in all the measured phenotypes. The apparent random distribution of induced changes observed in the mutant lines suggests that screening additional mutants may identify lines that combine a number of useful horticultural traits. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "abstract": "Indirect interactions driven by livestock and wild herbivores are increasingly recognized as important aspects of community dynamics in savannas and rangelands. Large ungulate herbivores can both directly and indirectly impact the reproductive structures of plants which in turn can affect the pollinators of those plants. We examined how wild herbivores and cattle each indirectly affect the abundance of a common pollinator butterfly taxon Colotis spp. at a set of long-term large herbivore exclosure plots in a semiarid savanna in central Kenya. We also examined effects of herbivore exclusion on the main food plant of Colotis spp. which was also the most common flowering species in our plots the shrub Cadaba farinosa. The study was conducted in four types of experimental plots cattle-only wildlife-only cattle and wildlife all large herbivores and no large herbivores. Across all plots Colotis spp. abundances were positively correlated with both Cadaba flower numbers adult food resources and total Cadaba canopy area larval food resources. Structural equation modeling SEM revealed that floral resources drove the abundance of Colotis butterflies. Excluding browsing wildlife increased the abundances of both Cadaba flowers and Colotis butterflies. However flower numbers and Colotis spp. abundances were greater in plots with cattle herbivory than in plots that excluded all large herbivores. Our results suggest that wild browsing herbivores can suppress pollinator species whereas well-managed cattle use may benefit important pollinators and the plants that depend on them. This study documents a novel set of ecological interactions that demonstrate how both conservation and livelihood goals can be met in a working landscape with abundant wildlife and livestock.",

Using population-based data we describe where AYAs with ALL receive treatment and determine associations with overall survival OS. METHODS Data from the 2004 to 2018 California CA n 2283 New York NY n 795 and Texas TX n 955 state cancer registries were used to identify treatment setting of AYAs with newly diagnosed ALL. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated associations with OS. RESULTS Seventy percent were older than 18 years and 65 were male. A majority in CA 63 and TX 64 were Hispanic while most in NY were non-Hispanic White 50. Treatment at an SCC occurred in 48.2 CA 44.4 NY and 19.5 TX. Across states AYAs who were older or uninsured were less likely to receive treatment at an SCC. Treatment at an SCC was associated with superior OS in CA hazard ratio HR 0.73 95 CI 0.63 to 0.85 and TX HR 0.61 95 CI 0.45 to 0.83 a nonsignificant association was seen in NY HR 0.83 95 CI 0.64 to 1.08. CONCLUSION Only 20-50 of AYA patients with ALL received frontline treatment at SCCs. Treatment of ALL at an SCC was associated with superior survival highlighting the importance of policy efforts to improve access and reduce inequities in AYA ALL care.",

    "abstract": "A large subset of patients with Angelman syndrome AS suffer from concurrent gastrointestinal GI issues including constipation poor feeding and reflux. AS is caused by the loss of ubiquitin ligase E3A UBE3A gene expression in the brain. Clinical features of AS which include developmental delays intellectual disability microcephaly and seizures are primarily due to the deficient expression or function of the maternally inherited UBE3A allele. The association between neurodevelopmental delay and GI disorders is part of the increasing evidence suggesting a link between the brain and the gut microbiome via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. To investigate the associations between colonization of the gut microbiota in AS we characterized the fecal microbiome in three animal models of AS involving maternal deletions of Ube3A including mouse rat and pig using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Overall we identified changes in bacterial abundance across all three animal models of AS. Specific bacterial groups were significantly increased across all animal models including Lachnospiraceae Incertae sedis Desulfovibrios sp. and Odoribacter which have been correlated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Taken together these findings suggest that specific changes to the local environment in the gut are driven by a Ube3a maternal deletion unaffected by varying housing conditions and are prominent and detectable across multiple small and large animal model species. These findings begin to uncover the underlying mechanistic causes of GI disorders in AS patients and provide future therapeutic options for AS patients. IMPORTANCE Angelman syndrome AS-associated gastrointestinal GI symptoms significantly impact quality of life in patients. In AS models in mouse rat and pig AS animals showed impaired colonization of the gut microbiota compared to wild-type healthy control animals. Common changes in AS microbiomes across all three animal models may play a causal effect for GI symptoms and may help to identify ways to treat these comorbidities in patients in the future.",

    "abstract": "A transformation procedure was developed in rice using a callus-specific promoter driving the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene as a selectable marker. The procedure was used to cotransform rice with nine plasmids. Fertile transgenic plants R0 were regenerated from 66 cell lines and transgenic R1 and R2 seeds were harvested. Polymerase chain reaction PCR showed that all cell lines carried at least three genes and 11 cell lines carried all nine genes. Progeny segregation analysis indicated that in most cases multiple transgenes were integrated into the same locus of the rice genome resulting in a 31 segregation of transgenes. Expression analysis demonstrated that about 50 of the transgenes were expressed. Four of the transgenic lines each expressed eight transgenes. The transgenes were expressed in all three test generations R0 R1 and R2. The stable expression of multiple transgenes is important in metabolic engineering and molecular breeding.",

    "abstract": "Entrywise powers of symmetric matrices preserving positivity monotonicity or convexity with respect to the Loewner ordering arise in various applications and have received much attention recently in the literature. Following FitzGerald and Horn 1977 8 it is well-known that there exists a critical exponent beyond which all entrywise powers preserve positive definiteness. Similar phenomena have also recently been shown by Hiai 2009 to occur for monotonicity and convexity. In this paper we complete the characterization of all the entrywise powers below and above the critical exponents that are positive monotone or convex on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. We then extend the original problem by fully classifying the positive monotone or convex powers in a more general setting where additional rank constraints are imposed on the matrices. We also classify the entrywise powers that are supersub-additive with respect to the Loewner ordering. Finally we extend all the previous characterizations to matrices with negative entries. Our analysis consequently allows us to answer a question raised by Bhatia and Elsner 2007 regarding the smallest dimension for which even extensions of the power functions do not preserve Loewner positivity.",

The LifeStat emergency airway is a portable device approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for emergency cricothyrotomy. It is small enough to secure to a keychain thus allowing instantaneous access at all times. We present a retrospective case series to report the experience of clinicians who have used the LifeStat device. METHODS A survey instrument was sent to a convenience sample of health-care professionals who purchased the LifeStat emergency airway. The survey queried device use user demographics and the success ease complications and location of use. RESULTS One thousand surveys were distributed and 100 individuals responded. Fifteen percent 15 of 100 reported use of the device on 17 occasions. The LifeStat was used successfully in all 17 cases. Eighty-two percent 14 of 17 of emergency use was in hospitals. In all cases the device was positioned successfully on the first attempt. No complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS The LifeStat device provides a relatively safe and effective means of performing emergency cricothyrotomy. The majority of emergency situations in which the device was deployed occurred in hospital settings.",

The importance of noncoding DNA in the origin of novel genes remains an open question. We used the well annotated genome of the genetic model system Drosophila melanogaster and genome sequences of related species to carry out a whole-genome search for new D. melanogaster genes that are derived from noncoding DNA. Here we describe five such genes four of which are X-linked. Our RT-PCR experiments show that all five putative novel genes are expressed predominantly in testes. These data support the idea that these novel genes are derived from ancestral noncoding sequence and that new favored genes are likely to invade populations under selective pressures relating to male reproduction.",

Diversity among orthopaedic trainees is the lowest in medicine and growth in percentage representation is the lowest of all surgical subspecialties. Women comprise only 6 of orthopaedic surgeons and 16 of orthopaedic surgery trainees. This extreme lack of diversity in orthopaedics limits creative problem-solving and the potential of our profession. Women in orthopaedics encounter sexual harassment overt discrimination and implicit bias which create barriers to training career satisfaction and success. Women are underrepresented in leadership positions perpetuating the lack of diversity through poor visibility to potential candidates which impedes recruitment. Correction will require a concerted effort as acknowledged by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons leadership who included a goal and plan to increase diversity in the 2019 to 2023 Strategic Plan. Recommended initiatives include support for pipeline programs that increase diversity of the candidate pool sexual harassment and implicit bias acknowledgement education and corrective action and the active sponsorship of qualified capable women by organizational leaders.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Excessive internal or external tibial torsion is frequently present in children with cerebral palsy. Several surgical techniques have been described to correct excessive tibial torsion including isolated distal tibial rotation osteotomy TRO. The anatomic changes surrounding this technique are poorly understood. The goal of the study was to examine the anatomic relationship between the tibia and fibula following isolated distal TRO in children with cerebral palsy. METHODS Twenty patients with 29 limbs were prospectively entered for study. CT scans of the proximal and distal tibiofibular TF articulations were obtained preoperatively at 6 weeks and 1 year postoperatively. Measurements of tibia and fibula torsion were performed at each interval. Qualitative assessments of proximal and distal TF joint congruency were also performed. RESULTS The subjects with internal tibia torsion ITT 19 limbs showed significant torsional changes for the tibia between preoperative postoperative and 1 year time points mean torsion 13.21 31.05 34.84 degrees respectively. Measurement of fibular torsion in the ITT treatment group also showed significant differences between time points mean -36.77 -26.77 -18.54 degrees respectively. Proximal and distal TF joints remained congruent at all time points in the study.Subjects with external tibia torsion ETT 10 limbs showed significant differences between preoperative and postoperative tibial torsion but not between postoperative and 1 year mean torsion 54 19.3 23.3 degrees respectively. Measurement of fibular torsion in the ETT treatment group did not change significantly between preoperative and postoperative but did change significantly between postoperative and 1 year mean torsion -9.8-16.9 -30.7 degrees respectively. Nine of 10 proximal TF joints were found to be subluxated at 6 weeks postoperatively. At 1 year all 9 of these joints had reduced. CONCLUSIONS Correction of ITT by isolated distal tibial external rotation osteotomy resulted in acute external fibular torsion. The fibular torsion alignment remodeled over time to accommodate the corrected tibial torsional alignment and reduce the strain associated with the plastic deformity of the fibula. Correction of ETT by isolated distal internal TRO resulted in acute subluxation of the proximal TF articulation in almost all cases. Subsequent torsional remodeling of the fibula resulted in correction of the TF subluxation in all cases. Acute correction of TT by isolated distal TRO occurs by distinct mechanisms based upon the direction of rotational correction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level II-Diagnostic.",

    "abstract": "AIMS Gynandroblastoma is a rare ovarian sex cord-stromal tumour characterised by the presence of both male Sertoli andor Leydig cells and female granulosa cells components. We investigated the mutational status of DICER1 FOXL2 and AKT1 genes at hot-spot regions that are known to be the key driving events in the development of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour SLCT adult granulosa cell tumour aGCT and juvenile granulosa cell tumour jGCT respectively to gain insights into the molecular pathogenesis of gynandroblastoma. METHODS AND RESULTS Sixteen cases of gynandroblastoma were studied. All contained SLCT or Sertoli cell tumour components. aGCT and jGCT components were identified in seven and 10 cases respectively with one presenting both components. Heterozygous hot-spot mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 were discovered in three cases including one case with heterologous mucinous elements all of which were composed of moderately or poorly differentiated SLCT and jGCT components and harboured the mutations in both histological components. None of the 16 cases displayed mutations at the p.C134W c.402CG of FOXL2 or within the pleckstrin-homology domain of AKT1. All cases showed FOXL2 immunostaining in both male and female components. CONCLUSION DICER1 hot-spot mutation is the key-driving event in a subset of gynandroblastomas containing components of SLCT and jGCT. Gynandroblastomas composed of SLCT and jGCT may represent morphological variants of SLCT. The molecular basis of gynandroblastoma containing a component of aGCT is different from pure aGCT.",

    "abstract": "Keystone individuals are expected to disproportionately contribute to group stability. For instance rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta who police conflict contribute towards stability. Not all individuals motivations align with mechanisms of group stability. In wild systems males typically disperse at maturity and attempt to ascend via contest competition. In a captive system dispersal is not naturally enabled - individuals attempt to ascend in their natal groups which can be enabled by matrilineal kin potentially destabilizing group dynamics. We relocated select high-ranking natal males from five groups and assessed group stability before and after. We quantified hierarchical metrics at the individual and group level. After removal we found significantly higher aggression against the established hierarchy reversals indicative of opportunistic attempts to change the hierarchy. Mixed-sex social signaling became more hierarchical but the strength of this effect varied. Stable structure was not uniformly reached across the groups and alpha males did not all benefit. Indiscriminate natal male removal is an unreliable solution to group instability. Careful assessment of how natal males are embedded within their group is necessary to balance individual and group welfare.",

    "abstract": "We develop a three-step computing approach to explore a hierarchical ranking network for a society of captive rhesus macaques. The computed network is sufficiently informative to address the question Is the ranking network for a rhesus macaque society more like a kingdom or a corporation Our computations are based on a three-step approach. These steps are devised to deal with the tremendous challenges stemming from the transitivity of dominance as a necessary constraint on the ranking relations among all individual macaques and the very high sampling heterogeneity in the behavioral conflict data. The first step simultaneously infers the ranking potentials among all network members which requires accommodation of heterogeneous measurement error inherent in behavioral data. Our second step estimates the social rank for all individuals by minimizing the network-wide errors in the ranking potentials. The third step provides a way to compute confidence bounds for selected empirical features in the social ranking. We apply this approach to two sets of conflict data pertaining to two captive societies of adult rhesus macaques. The resultant ranking network for each society is found to be a sophisticated mixture of both a kingdom and a corporation. Also for validation purposes we reanalyze conflict data from twenty longhorn sheep and demonstrate that our three-step approach is capable of correctly computing a ranking network by eliminating all ranking error.",

ANIMALS STUDIED Three groups of Miniature Horses were studied based on coat patterns suggestive of LPLP n3 LPlp n4 and lplp genotype n4. PROCEDURES Horses were categorized based on phenotype as well as pedigree analysis as LPLP LPlp and lplp. Neurophthalmic examination slit-lamp biomicroscopy indirect ophthalmoscopy and scotopic flash electroretinography were performed on all horses. Hair samples were processed for DNA analysis. Three SNPs identified and associated with LP and CSNB in the Appaloosa were investigated for association with LP and CSNB in these Miniature Horses. RESULTS All horses in the LPLP group were affected by CSNB while none in the LPlp or lplp groups were affected. All three SNPs were completely associated with LP genotype 2 22 P 0.0005 and CSNB status 2 11 P0.0005. CONCLUSIONS The Miniature Horse breed is affected by CSNB and it appears to be associated with LP as in the Appaloosa breed. The SNPs tested could be used as a DNA test for CSNB until the causative mutation is determined.",

Vacuum bags were collected in homes of 178 children diagnosed with ALL and 204 healthy controls age 0-7 years residing in California 2001-2007. Dust samples were sieved and analyzed for 19 PFAS using targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The effects of individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures were estimated for eight PFAS with at least 50 above the limit of quantification LOQ using logistic regression G-computation and generalized additive modeling GAM. In the model mutually adjusting for eight PFAS a statistically significant association was seen only for N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid EtFOSAA ORcontinuous 1.40 95 CI 1.05-1.86 and OR 4 th vs . 1 st quartile 2.58 mathrmOR_4mathrmth mathrmvs.1mathrmst mathrmquartile2.58 95 CI 1.16-5.71.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES Adult male Ay mice were either kept sedentary or exercised on a running wheel and fed ad libitum or diet restricted until weight matched to ad libitum-fed B6 control mice. Body composition plasma lipids leptin and adiponectin were measured. mRNA levels for leptin adiponectin lipoprotein lipase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 were measured in a visceral epididymal and a subcutaneous femoral fat depot by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Correlations among traits exhibited one of three patterns similar lines for B6 and Ay mice different slopes for B6 and Ay mice andor different intercepts for B6 and Ay mice. Correlations involving plasma leptin mesenteric and epididymal adipose weights or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were most likely to have different slopes andor intercepts in B6 and Ay mice. mRNA levels for leptin Acrp30 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and lipoprotein lipase in epididymal adipose tissue were not correlated with corresponding levels in femoral adipose tissue. DISCUSSION The agouti protein interferes with leptin signaling at melanocortin receptors in the hypothalamus of Ay mice. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the melanocortin portion of the leptin-signaling pathway mediates effects primarily on certain fat depots and on some but not all components of cholesterol homeostasis.",

Tracking tunnels are an effective and practical tool for monitoring changes in roof rat numbers in orchard systems but they rely on the use of attractive baits to draw in rats to the tracking surface. The identification of baits that are both attractive and readily available would be of great assistance for monitoring changes in roof rat numbers within agricultural fields. Therefore we tested the attractiveness of a soft bait Liphatech Rat and Mouse Attractant a wax block Liphatech NoTox peanut butter and a control i.e. no bait applied to roof rats when applied within tracking tunnels. We did not observe a difference in visitation to any of the tested attractants although all attractants yielded greater visitation rates than control tunnels. However tracking tunnels without any attractant were still visited at a relatively high rate indicating the tracking tunnel is attractive to roof rats. As such monitoring tools that provide shelter may increase detectability although this would need to be verified. Regardless all three food-based lures we tested increased the attractiveness of tracking tunnels and could be used to increase visitation to these monitoring devices.",

    "abstract": "Plant mitochondrial genomes are usually assembled and displayed as circular maps based on the widely-held view across the broad community of life scientists that circular genome-sized molecules are the primary form of plant mitochondrial DNA despite the understanding by plant mitochondrial researchers that this is an inaccurate and outdated concept. Many plant mitochondrial genomes have one or more pairs of large repeats that can act as sites for inter- or intramolecular recombination leading to multiple alternative arrangements isoforms. Most mitochondrial genomes have been assembled using methods unable to capture the complete spectrum of isoforms within a species leading to an incomplete inference of their structure and recombinational activity. To document and investigate underlying reasons for structural diversity in plant mitochondrial DNA we used long-read PacBio and short-read Illumina sequencing data to assemble and compare mitochondrial genomes of domesticated Lactuca sativa and wild L. saligna and L. serriola lettuce species. We characterized a comprehensive complex set of isoforms within each species and compared genome structures between species. Physical analysis of L. sativa mtDNA molecules by fluorescence microscopy revealed a variety of linear branched and circular structures. The mitochondrial genomes for L. sativa and L. serriola were identical in sequence and arrangement and differed substantially from L. saligna indicating that the mitochondrial genome structure did not change during domestication. From the isoforms in our data we infer that recombination occurs at repeats of all sizes at variable frequencies. The differences in genome structure between L. saligna and the two other Lactuca species can be largely explained by rare recombination events that rearranged the structure. Our data demonstrate that representations of plant mitochondrial genomes as simple circular molecules are not accurate descriptions of their true nature and that in reality plant mitochondrial DNA is a complex dynamic mixture of forms.",

Previous research has found that Black and Hispanic bicyclists and areas with higher populations of non-White residents lower median income and high poverty experience bicycle crashes more frequently than others. Although existing research has explored the role of socioeconomic status and the built environment in predicting crash frequency few scholars have studied how these factors account for disparities along racial and ethnic lines. Using a database of 7088 bicycle crashes over a three-year period in the San Francisco Bay Area this study examines the influence of socioeconomic transportation and land-use characteristics as potential causes of differences in bicycle crash occurrences among racial and ethnic groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. While areas of high poverty and high land-use intensity are associated with higher numbers of bicycle crashes overall lower-traffic streets and bicycle infrastructure do not affect the frequency of crashes involving Black and Hispanic cyclists. Black bicyclists have a disproportionate risk of being involved in a crash in poor urban neighborhoods controlling for other factors. These findings draw attention to the need for planners to consider how socioeconomic differences and vulnerability at the neighborhood level play a role in safety.",

    "abstract": "Extreme heatwaves and drought have been shown to significantly affect urban tree survival with potentially substantial economic costs for urban managers and local governments. During the 20192020 austral summer the western Sydney Local Government Area LGA of Penrith experienced unprecedented high temperatures with less than 60 of average rainfall compared with the proceeding five summers. This culminated in the highest temperature ever recorded in greater Sydney of 48.9 C. It is increasingly important that trees for urban applications are selected to be able to withstand such conditions. In early 2020 we conducted a visual assessment of canopy damage on street trees found in the Penrith LGA following the 20192020 summer heatwaves. We assessed the health of over 5500 trees and classified them as undamaged lightly damaged heavily damaged or defoliated. We found that more than 10 of all the trees assessed displayed some level of canopy damage with exotic deciduous species showing the greatest proportion of canopy damage. A logistic regression revealed that for exotic deciduous species the probability of having sustained no canopy damage was 79 lower than that for native evergreen species. Using these data the economic costs to replace damaged trees was calculated using two scenarios that incorporated costs of tree planting and maintenance low cost replacing all heavily damaged and defoliated trees with juvenile trees and high cost replacing all heavily damaged and defoliated trees with advanced trees with costs ranging from 500000 to 800000 AUD. We also calculated the cost of replacing all individuals of the most damaged species with more climate-resilient species in order to secure the urban forest and found that the cost would be over AUD1000000. This research highlights the importance of careful planning to ensure urban forest resilience and economic sustainability in the face of climate change.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Limited data are available on whether donor kidneys with diffuse glomerular fibrin thrombi GFT are safe to use. In this study the clinicopathologic characteristics of allografts with diffuse donor-derived GFT were examined. METHODS All deceased donor kidney transplant implantation biopsies from our institution between July 2011 and February 2018 with diffuse GFT were included. A control group for comparison consisted of all cases with implantation biopsies obtained during the study period without diffuse GFT. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records for all study patients including donor information. RESULTS Twenty-four recipients received kidneys with diffuse GFT from 16 deceased donors. All donors died from severe head trauma. On average 79 of glomeruli contained fibrin thrombi. Nineteen cases had subsequent biopsy all revealed resolution of GFT. Compared with the control group kidneys with diffuse GFT had longer cold ischemia time 34 versus 27 h were more frequently pumped using machine perfusion 100 versus 81 and recipients experienced a higher frequency of delayed graft function 58 versus 27. Only 2 grafts with diffuse GFT failed within the first year. Overall graft survival was similar between the diffuse GFT group and control group. CONCLUSIONS Deceased donor kidneys with diffuse GFT appear to be safe to use given that nearly 92 of recipients in this cohort who received such allografts experienced good clinical outcomes. Histologically GFT demonstrated rapid resolution following transplantation. Interestingly diffuse GFT only occurred in donors who suffered severe head trauma in this cohort which may be a predisposing factor.",

STUDY DESIGN Experimental observational study. ANIMALS A group of six healthy purpose-bred Beagle dogs four females and two males aged 6.5 0.1 years mean standard deviation. METHODS All dogs were administered a combination of medetomidine 40 g kg-1 and vatinoxan 800 g kg-1 as IV bolus. After 20 minutes the dogs were euthanized with an IV overdose of pentobarbital 140 mg kg-1 and both venous plasma and CNS tissues brain cervical and lumbar spinal cord were harvested. Concentrations of dexmedetomidine levomedetomidine and vatinoxan in all samples were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and data were analyzed with nonparametric tests with post hoc corrections where appropriate. RESULTS All dogs became deeply sedated after the treatment. The CNS-to-plasma ratio of vatinoxan concentration was approximately 150 whereas the concentrations of dexmedetomidine and levomedetomidine in the CNS were three- to seven-fold of those in plasma. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE With the doses studied these results confirm the peripheral selectivity of vatinoxan in dogs when coadministered IV with medetomidine. Thus it is likely that vatinoxan preferentially antagonizes 2-adrenoceptors outside the CNS.",

    "abstract": "Rodents are a major order of mammals that is highly diverse in distribution and lifestyle. Five suborders 34 families and 2277 species within this order occupy a number of different niches and vary along several lifestyle dimensions such as diel pattern diurnal vs. nocturnal terrain niche and diet. For example the terrain niche of rodents includes arboreal aerial terrestrial semi-aquatic burrowing and rock dwelling. Not surprisingly the behaviors associated with particular lifestyles are also highly variable and thus the neocortex which generates these behaviors has undergone corresponding alterations across species. Studies of cortical organization in species that vary along several dimensions such as terrain niche diel pattern and rearing conditions demonstrate that the size and number of cortical fields can be highly variable within this order. The internal organization of a cortical field also reflects lifestyle differences between species and exaggerates behaviorally relevant effectors such as vibrissae teeth or lips. Finally at a cellular level neuronal number and density varies for the same cortical field in different species and is even different for the same species reared in different conditions laboratory vs. wild-caught. These very large differences across and within rodent species indicate that there is no generic rodent model. Rather there are rodent models suited for specific questions regarding the development function and evolution of the neocortex.",

We release complete snapshots from three suites of simulations. The first comprises 20 simulations that zoom in on 14 Milky Way MW-mass galaxies five SMCLMC-mass galaxies and four lower-mass galaxies including one ultrafaint we release 39 snapshots across z 0-10. The second comprises four massive galaxies with 19 snapshots across z 1-10. Finally a high-redshift suite comprises 22 simulations with 11 snapshots across z 5-10. Each simulation also includes dozens of resolved lower-mass satellite galaxies in its zoom-in region. Snapshots include all stored properties for all dark matter gas and star particles including 11 elemental abundances for stars and gas and formation times ages of star particles. We also release accompanying subhalo catalogs which include galaxy properties and member star particles. For the simulations to z 0 including all MW-mass galaxies we release the formation coordinates and an ex situ flag for all star particles pointers to track particles across snapshots catalogs of stellar streams and multipole basis expansions for the halo mass distributions. We describe publicly available python packages for reading and analyzing these simulations.",

Switchgrass was pretreated under alkaline conditions with RF-assisted heating traditional water bath WB heating as control and subsequently enzymatically hydrolyzed. Fermentation was conducted with recombinant Escherichia coli strain for PHB production using the hydrolysates as carbon sources with or without yeast extract YE supplemented. Results indicated that the hydrolysates generated through RF pretreatment performed consistently better for PHB production than WB 50 higher PHB levels without YE. YE supplementation up to 5 gL enhanced fermentation under all conditions and diminished the difference among performances of fermentations. When adding 2 gL YE PHB production increased by 200 and 80 for WB and RF hydrolysates respectively. Supplementation of 5 gL YE brought the final PHB concentration to be very close to each other for all three fermentation conditions. Compared to traditional heating process the unique heating mechanism of RF generates harsher conditions under regular pressure to disrupt the biomass structure more completely and generate more nutrients for bacterial fermentation. RF was therefore proved to be an efficient process for biomass pretreatment.",

Preplant soil fumigation treatments of methyl bromide plus chloropicrin MBPic iodomethane plus chloropicrin IMPic 13-dichloropropene plus chloropicrin mixture followed by fb dazomet chloropicrin fb dazomet and a nonfumigated control were evaluated at three California strawberry runner plant nurseries through two production cycles. Fumigant efficacy was measured by weed seed viability bioassays weed density counts and time of handweeding. Generally all alternative fumigant treatments controlled weeds at levels comparable to MBPic. All fumigant treatments including MBPic killed more than 95 of common knotweed common purslane common chickweed and strawberry seed. Iodomethane chloropicrin fb dazomet and 13-dichloropropene plus chloropicrin mixture fb dazomet controlled carpetweed common lambsquarters hairy nightshade palmer amaranth and prostrate spurge. Handweeding inputs for all fumigants were similar to MBPic at three of four locations. The exception was at the low-elevation nursery in 2000 where handweeding times with MBPic were lower than for IMPic. Treatment and handweeding costs were calculated. The handweeding costs for all treatments were approximately the same. However the higher iodomethane material cost resulted in a substantially higher treatment cost.",

In the present study expression of GLT-1 and EAAC1 was examined in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using single cell mRNA amplification and immunocytochemistry with subtype specific antibodies. GLT-1 and EAAC1 mRNAs were observed in all neurons examined. Neuronal phenotype was confirmed in these cells by expression of neurofilament NF-L mRNA and absence of glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP mRNA. EAAC1 immunoreactivity was observed in essentially all cells which expressed neuron specific enolase NSE and GLT-1 immunoreactivity was detected in the majority approximately 90 of NSE-positive cells. Consistent with the glial expression of GLT-1 GLT-1 immunoreactivity was also observed in NSE-negative cells. These studies provide evidence that GLT-1 expression is not intrinsically restricted to glial cells but can occur in neurons under certain circumstances.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms can be performed with a wide variety of devices. Many of these grafts elevate the aortic bifurcation which can limit future repairs if the graft material fails thereby creating a type III endoleak to aorto-uniliac grafts. Many manufacturers have grafts susceptible to this but we have seen this in the Medtronic AneuRx graft. Our goal is to provide technical details and outcomes regarding a novel technique to reline these grafts while maintaining inline flow to the iliac arteries. METHODS This was a single-institution review of patients who had endoleaks requiring intervention after a previously placed graft with an elevated aortic bifurcation. Primary outcomes included technical success defined as placement of all planned devices resolution of type III endoleak aneurysm size at follow-up and requirement of reintervention. Secondary outcomes included 30-day complications aneurysm-related mortality and all-cause mortality. Technical details of the operation include back-table deployment of an Ovation device modification of the deployment system tether and pre-emptive placement of an up and over 0.014 wire. The wire is placed up and over and hung outside the contralateral gate. Once the main body is introduced above the old graft the 0.014 is snared from the contralateral side and externalized. The main body is then able to be seated at the bifurcation as the limb is not fully deployed and then device deployment is completed per instructions for use. RESULTS Our study consists of 4 individuals 3 of which had an abdominal aortic aneurysm initially managed with an AneuRx endovascular aneurysm repair and 1 with a combination of Gore and Cook grafts. All 4 patients were male with an average age of 84.5 years at time of reline. All patients had at least 10 years between initial surgery and reline at our institution. Primary outcomes revealed no type 1 or 3 endoleaks at follow-up technical success was 100 and 1 patient required reintervention for aneurysm growth and type 2 endoleak. In terms of our secondary outcomes there was 1 postoperative complication which was cardiac dysfunction secondary to demand ischemia aneurysm-related mortality was 0 and all-cause mortality was 25 at average follow-up of 2.44 years. CONCLUSIONS As individuals continue to age there are more patients who would benefit from less invasive reinterventions following endovascular aneurysm repair. Whether this is due to aortic degeneration stent migration or stent material damage is not always known. In this study we present an endovascular approach to treating type III endoleak patients with a previous graft and elevated aortic bifurcation using Ovation stent grafts and found no evidence of type 1 or 3 endoleaks on follow-up imaging. This approach may allow patients with type III endoleak the option of a minimally invasive percutaneous approach where they previously would not have had one.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To examine the association of a traditional Mexican diet score with risk of total breast and colorectal cancer among women of Mexican ethnic descent in the Womens Health Initiative WHI. METHODS Participants were WHI enrollees who self-identified as being of Mexican descent. Data from food frequency questionnaires self-administered at study baseline were used to calculate the MexD score with higher scores indicating greater adherence to an a priori-defined traditional Mexican diet high in dietary fiber vegetables and legumes. Incident cancers were self-reported by participants from 1993 to 2020 and adjudicated by trained physicians. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios HRs and 95 confidence intervals CIs. RESULTS Among 2343 Mexican descent women median baseline age 59 years a total of 270 cancers 88 breast 37 colorectal occurred during a mean follow-up of 14.4 years. The highest tertile of MexD score was associated with a lower risk of all-cancer incidence HR 0.67 95 CI 0.49-0.91 p-trend 0.01 and colorectal cancer HR 0.38 95 CI 0.14-0.998 p-trend 0.05 with each unit increase in the MexD score associated with a 6 lower risk of all-cancer incidence HR 0.94 95 CI 0.88-0.99. There was no statistically significant association with risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSION Consumption of a traditional Mexican diet was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cancer incidence and colorectal cancer. Confirmation of these findings in future studies is important given the prevalence of colorectal cancer and a growing U.S. population of women of Mexican descent.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Foreign body aspiration events are frequent in young children and in the geriatric population. They may result in several complications such as hypoxia edema cardiac arrest and death. Recently two commercially available devices the LifeVac and DeChoker have entered the market with the claim of relieving foreign body aspiration. Both devices are portable nonpowered suction devices that are being considered for use in large public spaces such as schools airports and malls despite previous studies detailing variable efficacy. In this study we aim to contribute further data on the safety and efficacy of these devices through a fresh cadaver model. METHODS Commonly aspirated foods of three different sizes saltines grapes and cashews were placed at the level of the true vocal folds in a fresh cadaver. Three participants performed two trials with each food and device. Device use was performed to manufacturer specifications. RESULTS The DeChoker resulted in gross injury to the tongue and failed to remove the obstruction in all trials. LifeVac was successful in removing the barium-moistened saltines but failed to remove all other foreign bodies. Both devices applied significant pressure to the tongue. CONCLUSION With the exception of the LifeVac removing saltine crackers all trials were entirely unsuccessful in relieving foreign body aspiration. Additionally both devices may cause significant pressure and injury to the oral cavity in a clinical setting. We conclude bystanders should continue to follow International Liaison Committee on Resuscitations guidelines on resuscitation to aid with relieving foreign body aspiration. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4.",

    "abstract": "Dechlorination and hydrodechlorination of multiply-chlorinated ethanes and propanes on a clean Cu100 surface have been studied by Auger electron spectroscopy temperature-programmed desorption and chemical displacement measurements. The rate-limiting step in degradation is dissociation of the first C-Cl bond in the molecule and this process is more facile in CCl2 groups than in CCl groups. The activation energies for C-Cl bond scission on Cu100 are 12-20 of the gas phase bond dissociation energies and the extent of dissociation by the physisorbed molecules is a sensitive function of the relative rates of C-Cl bond scission and molecular desorption. The chlorinated hydrocarbon fragments generated on the surface by C-Cl bond cleavage undergo facile - or -chlorine elimination while all C-H bonds remain intact. -Chlorine elimination dominates in cases where chlorine is present at both the - and -positions and as a result of -chlorine elimination alkenes are generated and evolved to the gas phase. In cases where no -Cl is present -chlorine elimination yields surface carbene intermediates which readily couple to form longer chain alkenes. Surface hydrogen atoms readily scavenge these carbene intermediates to form alkyl groups. Upon thermal activation these alkyls are converted to alkenes via -hydride elimination or to alkanes via coupling with surface hydrogen. All processes subsequent to the initial dissociative adsorption of the chlorinated hydrocarbon occur with 100 selectivity and all hydrocarbon products are evolved from the surface below 300 K. No carbon is detected on the surface after reaction but Cl remains adsorbed up to 750 K where it is evolved as CuCl.",

    "abstract": "In this study the detailed mechanisms of the rapid-folding Trp-cage mini-protein were investigated by extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of both wild-type and mutant proteins using a recently developed point-charge force field within the AMBER simulation package and the generalized Born treatment of solvation. Among the 77 100-ns simulations performed on the wild-type protein 5 of the simulation trajectories yielded structures with main-chain RMSDs of 1.0-2.0 from the native NMR structure. A gradual reduction in the value of the main-chain RMSD distribution was observed during the simulations which is consistent with the folding funnel theory. The folding time of 3 s based on native tertiary contacts is in reasonable agreement with an experimental value of 4 s. Detailed analysis suggests that packing of the structurally important Trp 25 side chain is involved in the rate-limiting step and unfolding of the misfolded states and overcoming the additional entropic barrier also contributed to the rate-limiting steps. This is reinforced by the faster folding rate of the W25F mutant. Two putative folding pathways were observed from the simulations and their folding rates differed by about 200-fold leading to a 3.2 kcalmol folding free energy barrier difference. Of this approximately 2.2 kcalmol was due to unfolding of the misfolded states and about 1.0 kcalmol was due to overcoming the entropic cost to move Trp 25 side chain into the native orientation. Although formation of the main-chain contacts was not the rate-limiting step we observed a hierarchical process in which the short-range native contacts formed faster than the long-range ones. These observations are consistent with the contact-order theory.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although particulate matter PM has not been consistently associated with breast cancer risk two studies have reported harmful associations for breast cancer survival. We examined PM exposures and breast cancer survival in two U.S.-based prospective cohort studies. METHODS The Nurses Health Study NHS and NHSII are cohorts with detailed data on medical history lifestyle factors and causes of death. Women with Stage I-III breast cancer n 8936 were followed through June 2014. Residential PM was estimated using spatio-temporal models. We performed Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios HR of breast cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality for 10 gm3 increases in post-diagnosis PM. RESULTS There were 1211 breast cancer-specific deaths. Overall PM was not associated with breast cancer-specific mortality PM2.5 HR 1.09 95 confidence interval CI 0.87-1.36 PM2.5-10 HR 1.03 95 CI 0.85-1.24 PM10 HR 1.05 95 CI 0.89-1.24 but was associated with modest increases in all-cause mortality PM2.5 HR 1.12 95 CI 0.96-1.30 PM2.5-10 HR 1.12 95 CI 1.00-1.24 PM10 HR 1.09 95 CI 1.01-1.18. However among participants with Stage I disease PM2.5 was associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality HR 1.64 95 CI 1.11-2.43. CONCLUSIONS PM was not associated with breast cancer-specific death overall however higher PM was associated with all-cause mortality. Higher PM2.5 was associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality among patients with Stage I breast cancer even after adjustment.

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are physiological and behavioral cycles with a period of approximately 24 hours that are generated by an endogenous clock or oscillator. Found in diverse organisms they are precisely controlled and provide growth and fitness benefits. Numerous microarray studies examining circadian control of gene expression have reported that a substantial fraction of the genomes of many organisms is clock-controlled. Here we show that a long-period mutant in Arabidopsis rve8-1 has a global alteration in phase of all clock-controlled genes. After several days in constant environmental conditions at which point the mutant and control plants have very different circadian phases we found 1557 genes to be differentially expressed in rve8-1 almost all of which are clock-regulated. However after adjusting for this phase difference only a handful show overall expression level differences between rve8-1 and wild type. Thus the apparent differential expression is mainly due to the phase difference between these two genotypes. These findings prompted us to examine the effect of phase on gene expression within a single genotype. Using samples of wild-type plants harvested at thirty-minute intervals we demonstrated that even this small difference in circadian phase significantly influences the results of differential expression analysis. Our study demonstrates the robust influence of the circadian clock on the transcriptome and provides a cautionary note for all biologists performing genome-level expression analysis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to determine the differences in growth rate of adrenal adenomas and malignant adrenal nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This was a retrospective review of adults with an adrenal nodule seen at two different abdominal or chest CT examinations or PETCT examinations. Patients in the adenoma group were included if they had a CT MRI or pathologic diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. Patients in the malignant group were included if they had a pathologically proven malignant adrenal nodule. Nodule growth was defined as a change in the largest axial diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm. Growth rate was calculated by dividing the change in the longest axial diameter by the time between the first and last imaging examination. RESULTS. There were 105 adenomas and 26 malignant nodules. Of the 105 adenomas 34 32.4 95 CI 23.6-42.2 grew three 2.9 95 CI 0.6-8.1 became smaller and 68 64.8 95 CI 54.8-73.8 were unchanged in size. All 26 100 95 CI 89.1-100 malignant nodules grew. The mean SD growth rate of adenomas was 1.0 0.67 mmyear range 0.3-2.8 mmyear compared with 58.4 78.5 mmyear range 5.8-395.4 mmyear for malignant nodules p 0.001. A growth rate of 3 mmyear distinguished adenomas from malignant nodules with a sensitivity of 100 95 CI 86.8-100 and a specificity of 100 95 CI 96.6-100. CONCLUSION. Approximately one-third of radiologically proven adrenal adenomas grew all of which grew at a rate less than 3 mmyear. All malignant adrenal nodules grew and all at a rate greater than 5 mmyear.",

    "abstract": "Of the approximately 250000 species of flowering plants nearly one in ten are members of the Compositae Asteraceae a diverse family found in almost every habitat on all continents except Antarctica. With an origin in the mid Eocene the Compositae is also a relatively young family with remarkable diversifications during the last 40 My. Previous cytologic and systematic investigations suggested that paleopolyploidy may have occurred in at least one Compositae lineage but a recent analysis of genomic data was equivocal. We tested for evidence of paleopolyploidy in the evolutionary history of the family using recently available expressed sequence tag EST data from the Compositae Genome Project. Combined with data available on GenBank we analyzed nearly 1 million ESTs from 18 species representing seven genera and four tribes. Our analyses revealed at least three ancient whole-genome duplications in the Compositae-a paleopolyploidization shared by all analyzed taxa and placed near the origin of the family just prior to the rapid radiation of its tribes and independent genome duplications near the base of the tribes Mutisieae and Heliantheae. These results are consistent with previous research implicating paleopolyploidy in the evolution and diversification of the Heliantheae. Further we observed parallel retention of duplicate genes from the basal Compositae genome duplication across all tribes despite divergence times of 33-38 My among these lineages. This pattern of retention was also repeated for the paleologs from the Heliantheae duplication. Intriguingly the categories of genes retained in duplicate were substantially different from those in Arabidopsis. In particular we found that genes annotated to structural components or cellular organization Gene Ontology categories were significantly enriched among paleologs whereas genes associated with transcription and other regulatory functions were significantly underrepresented. Our results suggest that paleopolyploidy can yield strikingly consistent signatures of gene retention in plant genomes despite extensive lineage radiations and recurrent genome duplications but that these patterns vary substantially among higher taxonomic categories.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Studies have demonstrated superior outcomes for adolescent and young adult AYA patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL who are treated using pediatric versus adult therapeutic regimens. To the best of our knowledge whether adult oncologists in the United States have adopted this approach to ALL in AYA patients is currently unknown. The objective of the current study was to provide a population-based description of ALL treatment patterns in AYA individuals over the past decade. METHODS Data regarding AYA patients aged 15 to 39 years and diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2014 while living in the Greater Bay Area were obtained from the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry GBACR. Treating facilities were designated as pediatric or adult centers induction treatment regimens were abstracted from registry text data fields. RESULTS Of 304 patients diagnosed in the GBACR catchment region complete treatment data were available for 229 75. The location of care was identified for 296 patients 97 treated at 31 unique centers. Approximately 70 of AYA patients received induction therapy at an adult treatment center. All AYA patients who were treated at pediatric centers received pediatric ALL regimens. Among AYA patients treated by adult oncologists with complete treatment data none received a pediatric regimen before 2008. Between 2008 and 2012 while the US Adult Intergroup C10403 pediatric-inspired ALL protocol was open to accrual 31 of AYA patients treated by adult oncologists received pediatric regimens. This rate fell to 21 from 2013 through 2014. Adult facilities treating 2 AYA patients with ALL per year captured in the GBACR were more likely to administer pediatric regimens than lower volume centers P .03. CONCLUSIONS As of 2014 only a minority of AYA patients with ALL received pediatric ALL regimens at adult cancer centers. Cancer 2017122-130. 2016 American Cancer Society.",

    "abstract": "Optimising the spatial distribution of free-ranging livestock is a significant challenge in expansive grazed landscapes across the globe. Grazing managers use practices such as herding i.e. droving strategic placement of off-stream livestock drinking water and nutritional supplements and strategic fencing in attempts to distribute livestock away from sensitive streams and riparian areas. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 46 cattle-grazed riparian areas and associated stream reaches embedded in rugged range landscapes to examine relationships between implementation of these management practices stocking rate and riparian health. We determined in-stream benthic invertebrate assemblages at each site to serve as an integrative metric of riparian health. We also collected information from the grazing manager on stocking rate and implementation of livestock distribution practices at each site over the decade before this study. Off-stream livestock drinking-water sources were implemented at just two sites 4.3 indicating that this was not a common distribution practice in these remote management units. We found no significant relationship of riparian health i.e. invertebrate richness metrics with stocking rate P 0.45 in all cases or with the simple implementation yesno of off-stream nutritional supplements fence maintenance and livestock herding P 0.22 in all cases. However we did find significant positive relationships between riparian health and managerial effort person-days spent per year for each individual practice to implement off-stream nutritional supplements and fence maintenance P 0.017 in all cases. Livestock herding effort had an apparent positive association with riparian health P 0.2 in all cases. Results highlight that site-specific variation in managerial effort accounts for some of the observed variation in practice effectiveness and that appropriate managerial investments in grazing distributional practices can improve riparian conditions.",

To do so we implemented a statewide survey of Georgia residents N 2890 and using that data we applied factor analyses to two blocks of AV-related statements. The first block measured 12 perceptions of AVs and yielded two psychological constructs AV pros advantages benefits and AV overuse cons negative outcomes specifically associated with the excessive use of AVs. The second block of statements measured respondents inclinations between AV and non-AV options for 12 hypothetical transportation needs and factor analysis identified four mode-use propensity constructs AV-inclined over walkbike AV over flight zero-occupant AV over occupied AV and AV over transit. The main goal of the paper was to segment the sample on the basis of these four mode-use propensities to identify clusters with similar propensity profiles or response vectors. We applied latent class cluster analysis to do so and identified seven potential market segments some preferring AV options in general others preferring non-AV options or having unique propensity patterns based on certain contexts e.g. long distance travel and vehicle occupancy. In the model socio-demographics geography attitudes and perceptions of AVs help characterize those market segments and this provides a basis for deeper interpretation and consideration of policy implications.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective study. ANIMALS Healthy adult Beagle dogs n 5. METHODS All dogs had biochemical panels and complete blood counts preoperatively. Computed tomography lymphography CTL was performed prior to a standard 3-port thoracoscopic approach. A mixture of MB and ICG was injected by ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection into right or left-sided hepatic lobes. Data collected included dose of contrast agent MB vs. ICG injection site timing and quality of operative TD identification. Potential hepatic injury was assessed by repeat laboratory evaluation and abdominal ultrasound 14 days postoperatively. RESULTS Preoperative CTL provided a diagnostic study in 55 dogs. After intrahepatic injection of combined dyes NIRFL allowed visualization of TDs in 55 dogs but MB did not result in visible TD coloration in any dog. Intrahepatic injection of ICG achieved successful NIRFL in a median time of 6 minutes and persisted for the 20 minute observation period in all five dogs. All dogs recovered without complication and were subsequently adopted. CONCLUSION NIRFL of the TD can be achieved with intraoperative hepatic injection of ICG. Intrahepatic injection of MB did not result in visible TD coloration. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Hepatic intra-parenchymal injection is a reliable alternative portal into the TD system for intraoperative visualization of TD anatomy using ICG in dogs.",

    "abstract": "Objectives-The aim of this study was to determine the intra- and inter-rater reliability of sonographic measurements of the median nerve cross-sectional area in individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome and healthy control participants.Methods-The median nerve cross-sectional area was evaluated by sonography in 18 participants with carpal tunnel syndrome 18 upper extremities and 9 control participants 18 upper extremities at 2 visits 1 week apart. Two examiners both blinded to the presence or absence of carpal tunnel syndrome captured independent sonograms of the median nerve at the levels of the carpal tunnel inlet pronator quadratus and mid-forearm. The cross-sectional area was later measured by each examiner independently. Each also traced images that were captured by the other examiner.Results-Both the intra- and inter-rater reliability rates were highest for images taken at the carpal tunnel inlet radiologist r 0.86 sonographer r 0.87 inter-rater r 0.95 all P .0001 whereas they was lowest for the pronator quadratus r 0.49 0.29 and 0.72 respectively all P .0001. At the mid-forearm the intra-rater reliability was lower for both the radiologist and sonographer whereas the inter-rater reliability was relatively high r 0.54 0.55 and 0.81 all P .0001. Tracing of captured images by different examiners showed high concordance for the median cross-sectional area at the carpal tunnel inlet r 0.96-0.98 P .0001.Conclusions-The highest intra- and inter-rater reliability was found at the carpal tunnel inlet. The results also demonstrate that tracing of the median nerve cross-sectional area from captured images by different examiners does not contribute significantly to measurement variability.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Undernutrition is associated with an elevated risk of mortality among children in low- and middle-income countries. Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements LNS have been evaluated as a method to prevent undernutrition and improve infant development but the effects on mortality are unknown. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to evaluate the effect of LNS on all-cause mortality among children 6-24 mo old. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of LNS designed to prevent undernutrition with or without other interventions. Literature was searched in May 2019 and trials were included if they enrolled children between 6 and 24 mo old and the period of supplementation lasted 6 mo. We extracted data from participant flow diagrams and contacted study investigators to request data. We conducted a meta-analysis to produce summary RR estimates. RESULTS We identified 18 trials conducted in 11 countries that enrolled 41280 children and reported 586 deaths. The risk of mortality was lower in the LNS arms than in the non-LNS comparison arms RR 0.73 95 CI 0.59 0.89 13 trials. Estimates were similar when trials with maternal LNS intervention arms were added or when alternative formulations of LNS were excluded. The results appeared stronger in trials in which LNS were compared with passive control arms. Excluding these contrasts and only comparing multicomponent arms with LNS groups and comparison groups that contained all the same components without LNS attenuated the effect estimate RR 0.82 95 CI 0.61 1.10. CONCLUSIONS LNS provided for the prevention of undernutrition may reduce the risk of mortality but more trials with appropriate comparison groups allowing isolation of the effect of LNS alone are needed.This study was registered at www.crd.york.ac.ukPROSPERO as CRD42019128718.",

    "abstract": "From a genomic analysis of rumen butyrivibrios Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio sp. we have re-evaluated the contribution of electron transport phosphorylation ETP to ATP formation in this group. This group is unique in that most 76 genomes were predicted to possess genes for both Ech and Rnf transmembrane ion pumps. These pumps act in concert with the NifJ and Bcd-Etf to form a electrochemical potential H and Na which drives ATP synthesis by ETP. Of the 62 total butyrivibrio genomes currently available from the Hungate 1000 project all 62 were predicted to possess NifJ which reduces oxidized ferredoxin Fdox during pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA. All 62 possessed all subunits of Bcd-Etf which reduces Fdox and oxidizes reduced NAD during crotonyl-CoA reduction. Additionally 61 genomes possessed all subunits of the Rnf which generates H or Na from oxidation of reduced Fd Fdred and reduction of oxidized NAD. Further 47 genomes possessed all six subunits of the Ech which generates H from oxidation of Fdred. For glucose fermentation to butyrate and H2 the electrochemical potential established should drive synthesis of 1.5 ATP by the F0F1-ATP synthase possessed by all 62 genomes. The total yield is 4.5 ATPglucose after accounting for three ATP formed by classic substrate-level phosphorylation and it is one the highest yields for any glucose fermentation. The yield was the same when unsaturated fatty acid bonds not H served as the electron acceptor as during biohydrogenation. Possession of both Ech and Rnf had been previously documented in only a few sulfate-reducers was rare in other rumen prokaryotic genomes in our analysis and may confer an energetic advantage to rumen butyrivibrios. This unique energy conservation system might enhance the butyrivibrios ability to overcome growth inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids as postulated herein.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Despite improvements in the early resuscitation of the critically injured mortality from multiple organ failure has remained stable with the lung often the first organ to fail. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation predispose patients to the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure. Our objective was to establish a murine model of combined injury consisting of burntrauma and pulmonary sepsis with reproducible end-organ responses and mortality. METHODS Male B6D2F1 mice were divided into four groups burninfection BI burn B infection I and sham S. Burned animals had a full-thickness 15 dorsal scald burn. BI and I groups were inoculated intratracheally with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3-5 x 103 colony-forming units. S and B animals received saline intratracheally. All animals were resuscitated with 2 mL of intraperitoneal saline. Mortality was recorded at 24 48 and 72 hours. Bacterial sepsis was confirmed by tissue Grams stain of the lungs and positive organ and blood cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Femoral bone marrow cells were collected at 72 hours from surviving animals. Clonogenic potential was assessed by response to macrophage M colony-stimulating factor CSF and granulocyte-macrophage GM CSF in a soft agar assay and the data were represented as colonies per femur. Isolated alveolar macrophages and whole lung tissue were assayed for levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. RESULTS Mortality at 72 hours was 30 in BI 12 in I and 10 in B and S groups. Pneumonia was documented in all infected animals at 24 hours by Grams stain and positive tissue cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Systemic sepsis as confirmed by blood and remote organ cultures was seen in BI animals only. Significantly increased responsiveness to M-CSF stimulations was noted in all groups BI 8291 - 1402 coloniesfemur B 6357 - 806 coloniesfemur and I 8054 - 1112 coloniesfemur p 0.05 relative to sham 3369 - 883 coloniesfemur p 0.05. Maximal responsiveness to GM-CSF stimulation was noted in the BI group 11932 - 982 coloniesfemur p 0.05 and similar GM responsiveness was noted in all other groups B 7135 - 548 coloniesfemur I 7023 - 810 coloniesfemur and S 6829 - 1439 coloniesfemur. Alveolar macrophage release of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 increased in all animals but the magnitude of increase was not proportional to the strength of the inciting stimulus. CONCLUSION Although minimal perturbations were seen after burn or pulmonary infection alone the combined insult of burn and pulmonary sepsis resulted in statistically significant hematopoietic changes with increased monocytopoiesis. Only the combined injury resulted in systemic sepsis and significantly increased mortality. We have developed a clinically relevant model of trauma and pulmonary sepsis that will allow further clarification of the inflammatory response after injury and infection.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To identify disease-causing mutations in two consanguineous Pakistani families with fundus albipunctatus. METHODS Affected individuals in both families underwent a thorough clinical examination including funduscopy and electroretinography. Blood samples were collected from all participating members and genomic DNA was extracted. Exclusion analysis was completed with microsatellite short tandem repeat markers that span all reported loci for fundus albipunctatus. Two-point logarithm of odds LOD scores were calculated and coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of RLBP1 were sequenced bi-directionally. RESULTS The ophthalmic examination of affected patients in both families was consistent with fundus albipunctatus. The alleles of markers on chromosome 15q flanking RLBP1 segregated with the disease phenotype in both families and linkage was further confirmed by two-point LOD scores. Bi-directional sequencing of RLBP1 identified a nonsense mutation R156X and a missense mutation G116R that segregated with the disease phenotype in their respective families. CONCLUSIONS These results strongly suggest that mutations in RLBP1 are responsible for fundus albipunctatus in the affected individuals of these consanguineous Pakistani families.",

    "abstract": "Ambient PM2.5 was collected during the winter season from Taiyuan Shanxi China Jinan Shandong China and Sacramento California USA and used to create PMSX PMSD and PMCA extracts respectively. Time-lag experiments were performed to explore the in vivo and in vitro toxicity of the PM extracts. In vivo inflammatory lung responses were assessed in BALBc mice using a single oropharyngeal aspiration OPA of PM extract or vehicle CTRL on Day 0. Necropsies were performed on Days 1 2 and 4 post-OPA and pulmonary effects were determined using bronchoalveolar lavage BAL and histopathology. On Day 1 BAL neutrophils were significantly elevated in all PM- versus CTRL-exposed mice with PMCA producing the strongest response. However histopathological scoring showed greater alveolar and perivascular effects in PMSX-exposed mice compared to all three other groups. By Day 4 BAL neutrophilia and tissue inflammation were resolved similar across all groups. In vitro effects were examined in human HepG2 hepatocytes and U937 cells following 6 24 or 48 h of exposure to PM extract or DMSO control. Luciferase reporter and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine in vitro effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR activation and gene transcription respectively. Though all three PM extracts activated AhR PMSX produced the greatest increases in AhR activation and mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 cytochrome P450 interleukin IL-8 and interleukin IL-1. These effects were assumed to result from a greater abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs in PMSX compared to PMSD and PMCA.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND It has been suggested that diseases that promote isosthenuria predispose to urinary tract infections because of a lack of the common bacteriostatic properties present in concentrated urine. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to assess the clinicopathologic risk factors for positive urine culture outcome in cats with chronic kidney disease CKD diabetes mellitus DM uncontrolled hyperthyroidism HT or lower urinary tract disease LUTD. METHODS For this retrospective study medical records of all cats in which a urinalysis and aerobic bacterial urine culture were performed between January 1995 and December 2002 were reviewed. Signalment body weight and clinicopathologic data were recorded. Based on the medical records cats were diagnosed with CKD DM HT or LUTD. Prevalence odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression. Multivariate models were created for each variable of interest while controlling for the confounding effect of disease group. RESULTS Six hundred fourteen cats met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Overall positive urine cultures were identified in 16.9 of cats with CKD 13.2 of cats with DM 21.7 of cats with HT and 4.9 of cats with clinical signs of LUTD. Decreasing urine specific gravity was not associated with positive urine culture when controlled for disease but pyuria bacteriuria and hematuria were all associated with positive urine culture outcome. Persians females increasing age and decreasing body weight were all associated with positive urine culture outcome. CONCLUSIONS Performing a urine culture sample based solely on the presence of isosthenuria does not seem warranted. Further studies are warranted to help identify host predisposing factors for urinary bacterial colonization in cats with these diseases.",

We used isoflurane to anesthetize 12 prairie dogs for 60 min. Blood samples were obtained from each animal immediately after anesthesia induction and at 30 and 60 min and used for analysis of plasma T4 concentration. The plasma T4 concentration mean 1 SD was significantly decreased from baseline 3.49 0.52 gdL at both 30 min 3.24 0.52 gdL and 60 min 3.27 0.65 gdL after induction. Compared with baseline some of the T4 trends were inconsistent between animals and individual variability in response was responsible for 86 of the overall variability. Regardless of the observed change under isoflurane anesthesia all measurements in all prairie dogs and at all time points 2.4 to 4.4 gdL were within the reported normal plasma T4 reference range for this species. In conclusion isoflurane anesthesia appears to cause a significant but inconsistent reduction in plasma T4 concentrations in black-tailed prairie dogs but because values remain within normal basal levels the clinical importance of this effect is likely minimal.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Hospital transfers from VA Community Living Centers CLCs are common. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of introducing the Intervention to Reduce Acute Care Transfers INTERACT program into VA CLCs. METHODS Cluster randomized trial involving 16 pair-matched VA CLCs. INTERVENTIONS Intervention CLC nursing staff were trained in the use of INTERACT tools designed to identify early signs of a clinical change in condition and improve communication and documentation. One tool was embedded into the VA Electronic Medical Record. Intervention staff were supported by bi-weekly calls over 18 months to reinforce INTERACT tool use. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome for intent-to-treat analyses was the rate of all-cause hospitalizations per 1000 person days. Secondary outcomes assessed through structured record reviews and algorithms were intervention CLCs change in 1 potentially inappropriate transfer decisions and 2 potentially preventable transfers. CLC staff implementation and engagement in INTERACT were documented. RESULTS Only five of the eight intervention CLCs substantially engaged in the intervention. Using a negative-binomial regression with random effects adjusting for month intervention and the interaction of time and the intervention we observed no statistically significant difference between intervention and control facilities in all-cause hospitalizations. This was confirmed with matched resident-level as-treated analyses among residents in the five engaged CLCs and their matched controls. Structured implicit review of intervention CLCs medical records revealed low rates of inappropriate transfer decisions both before and after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS Introducing INTERACT into volunteer VA CLCs did not reduce the rates of all-cause hospitalizations. In both the pre- and post-intervention periods all-cause hospitalization rates were relatively higher and inappropriate transfers lower in VA CLCs than commonly observed in community NHs. Low rates of potentially inappropriate transfers and higher nurse and physician staffing in CLCs may explain why INTERACT was not implemented as fully as planned.",

All 60 L. serriola accessions were susceptible while all 83 accessions of L. saligna were resistant. Out of the 69 L. aculeata accessions 36 52.2 were resistant. From those resistant accessions 56 L. saligna and 23 L.aculeata accessions were then tested at the seedling stage for their reaction against five highly virulent isolates originating from California and representing the two current major pathotypes and a novel type of B. lactucae true leaves of adult plants were also tested with two out of these five isolates. Our study supports previous observations that L. saligna is highly resistant to B. lactucae. However our results provide additional evidence that L. saligna may not be an absolutely non-host plant for B. lactucae at least at a seedling stage which is in agreement with other recent data for this species. Sixteen 69.6 out of the 23 L. aculeata accessions expressed resistance against all isolates tested even in seedling stage as well as in true leaves of adult plants. This study is probably the first report of detailed screening of resistance to some B. lactucae isolates in natural populations of L. aculeata. These patterns of resistance reactions show that L. aculeata a species within the primary lettuce gene pool should be considered as an attractive source of germplasm for resistance breeding of cultivated lettuce L. sativa.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Workflow efficiency WFE is essential to the practice of emergency medicine EM but a standardized approach to measuring and teaching it during residency is lacking. In this study we sought to describe how EM residency programs in the United States currently measure and teach WFE and to assess the relative importance of WFE teaching to EM residency program leaders. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey of all accredited EM residency training programs in the United States in Fall 2019. We invited all allopathic EM residency programs to participate in the study by directly emailing program directors and assistantassociate program directors. We conducted the study and performed descriptive statistics using SurveyMonkey software. RESULTS We received a total of 133 responses out of 190 total programs 70 with proportionate representation from 3- and 4-year programs and all regions of the United States. When asked to what extent teaching efficiency should be a priority compared to other educational goals 65 of program leaders responded with significant or moderate priority. Most EM programs collect WFE data on their residents either by tracking patients per hour 78 or by written evaluations 59. Common methods for providing WFE data to residents were individual data provided along with deidentified rank 35 data provided only during private feedback meetings 26 and no data or rank provided to residents 16. Regarding targeted WFE teaching to residents 88 reported utilizing general on-shift teaching 48 reported teaching WFE during formal didactics and 45 during dedicated private feedback sessions. CONCLUSION This national study of allopathic U.S. EM programs suggests that most EM program leaders do value WFE teaching. However we found no consistent approach among programs for tracking or distributing resident WFE data and many programs lack a formalized way to teach efficiency to their residents.",

A seasonal component has been implicated in onset of clinical signs which occur during the spring and summer months.

OBJECTIVEHYPOTHESIS To assess concentrations of luteinizing hormone LH over an 8-hour period in gelded healthy controls and horses affected with headshaking. Our hypothesis was that geldings with seasonal headshaking would have higher concentrations of LH over an 8-hour period compared to control horses during the summer when affected horses manifested headshaking. ANIMALS Twelve geldings 6 controls and 6 affected. METHODS Prospective controlled trial. Blood samples were drawn every 15 minutes over an 8-hour time period during summer from all horses to measure circulating LH concentrations by using a radioimmunoassay for equine LH. All affected horses were actively affected by headshaking at the time of sample collection. RESULTS No statistically significant differences in LH concentrations were found throughout the study period in headshakers as compared to control horses. Time had no significant effect but a slight decrease in LH concentrations was observed for all horses. The main limitation of the study was the low number of horses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Horses affected with headshaking did not have significant differences in circulating LH during the late summer as compared to control horses.",

ANIMALS 239 dogs in shelters in San Diego and Imperial counties US and Mexicali and Tijuana Mexico. PROCEDURES Each dog had blood drawn and basic demographic data collected. PCR was performed to determine active infection with Rickettsia spp E canis and A platys. Serology was performed to determine exposure to Rickettsia Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species. RESULTS 2 of 78 2.6 dogs sampled in Tijuana were actively infected with R rickettsii. A single brown dog tick collected from a dog in Tijuana was PCR-positive for R rickettsii. Infection with E canis and A platys ranged across shelters from 0 to 27 and 0 to 33 respectively. Dogs in all 4 locations demonstrated exposure to all 3 pathogens though Rickettsia and Ehrlichia seropositivity was highest in Mexicali 81 and 49 respectively and Anaplasma seropositivity was highest in Tijuana 45. CLINICAL RELEVANCE While infection and exposure were highest in sheltered dogs in the southern locations dogs in all locations demonstrated exposure to all pathogens demonstrating the potential for emergence and spread of zoonotic pathogens with significant public health consequences in southern California and northern Baja California. In addition veterinarians and shelter staff should be aware that Ehrlichia or Anaplasma infection may co-occur with Rocky Mountain spotted fever which is a human health risk.",

Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild- and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species signals of gene flow and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct groups Nigeria-Cameroonwestern and centraleastern populations. We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at or close to genes in almost all species. We discover and assign 1982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape lineages determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny.

Almost sure irreducibility is proved for any complex-valued object whose support set has rank 2. While the new irreducibility result can be viewed as a probabilistic version of the classical result by Bruck Sodin and Hayes it provides a novel perspective and an effective method for phase retrieval. In particular almost sure uniqueness up to a global phase is proved for complex-valued objects under general two-point conditions. Under a tight sector constraint absolute uniqueness is proved to hold with probability exponentially close to unity as the object sparsity increases. Under a magnitude constraint with random amplitude illumination uniqueness modulo global phase is proved to hold with probability exponentially close to unity as object sparsity increases. For general complex-valued objects without any constraint almost sure uniqueness up to global phase is established with two sets of Fourier magnitude data under two independent illuminations. Numerical experiments suggest that random illumination essentially alleviates most if not all numerical problems commonly associated with the standard phasing algorithms. 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Collaboration networks are a ubiquitous way to characterize the interactions between people. In this paper we consider the problem of inferring social relations in collaboration networks such as the fields that researchers collaborate in or the categories of projects that Github users work on together. Social relation inference can be formalized as a multi-label classification problem on graph edges but many popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs only operate on the nodes of a graph. To bridge this gap we propose a principled method which leverages the natural homophily present in collaboration networks. First observing that the fields of collaboration for two people are usually at the intersection of their interests we transform an edge labeling into node labels. Second we use a label propagation algorithm to propagate node labels in the entire graph. Once the label distribution for all nodes has been obtained we can easily infer the label distribution for all edges. Experiments on two large-scale collaboration networks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for social relation inference by a large margin in addition to running several orders of magnitude faster.",

    "abstract": "Frequent violation of flunixin residues in tissues from cattle has been attributed to non-compliance with the USFDA-approved route of administration and withdrawal time. However the effect of administration route and physiological differences among animals on tissue depletion has not been determined. The objective of this work was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic PBPK model to predict plasma liver and milk concentrations of flunixin in cattle following intravenous i.v. intramuscular i.m. or subcutaneous s.c. administration for use as a tool to determine factors that may affect the withdrawal time. The PBPK model included blood flow-limited distribution in all tissues and elimination in the liver kidney and milk. Regeneration of parent flunixin due to enterohepatic recirculation and hydrolysis of conjugated metabolites was incorporated in the liver compartment. Values for physiological parameters were obtained from the literature and partition coefficients for all tissues but liver and kidney were derived empirically. Liver and kidney partition coefficients and elimination parameters were estimated for 14 pharmacokinetic studies including five crossover studies from the literature or government sources in which flunixin was administered i.v. i.m. or s.c. Model simulations compared well with data for the matrices following all routes of administration. Influential model parameters included those that may be age or disease-dependent such as clearance and rate of milk production. Based on the model route of administration would not affect the estimated days to reach the tolerance concentration 0.125 mg kg-1 in the liver of treated cattle. The majority of USDA-reported violative residues in liver were below the upper uncertainty predictions based on estimated parameters which suggests the need to consider variability due to disease and age in establishing withdrawal intervals for drugs used in food animals. The model predicted that extravascular routes of administration prolonged flunixin concentrations in milk which could result in violative milk residues in treated cattle.",

    "abstract": "Development of a suitable mouse model would facilitate the investigation of pathomechanisms underlying human psoriasis and would also assist in development of therapeutic treatments. However while many psoriasis mouse models have been proposed no single model recapitulates all features of the human disease and standardized validation criteria for psoriasis mouse models have not been widely applied. In this study whole-genome transcriptional profiling is used to compare gene expression patterns manifested by human psoriatic skin lesions with those that occur in five psoriasis mouse models K5-Tie2 imiquimod K14-AREG K5-Stat3C and K5-TGFbeta1. While the cutaneous gene expression profiles associated with each mouse phenotype exhibited statistically significant similarity to the expression profile of psoriasis in humans each model displayed distinctive sets of similarities and differences in comparison to human psoriasis. For all five models correspondence to the human disease was strong with respect to genes involved in epidermal development and keratinization. Immune and inflammation-associated gene expression in contrast was more variable between models as compared to the human disease. These findings support the value of all five models as research tools each with identifiable areas of convergence to and divergence from the human disease. Additionally the approach used in this paper provides an objective and quantitative method for evaluation of proposed mouse models of psoriasis which can be strategically applied in future studies to score strengths of mouse phenotypes relative to specific aspects of human psoriasis.",

We examined aspects of collagen cross-linking in dystrophin-deficient murine canine and human skeletal muscle. METHODS DMD patient biopsies and samples from mdx mice and golden retriever muscular dystrophy dog samples with appropriate controls were analyzed. Collagen cross-linking was evaluated using solubility and hydroxyproline assays. Expression of the cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase LOX was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS LOX protein levels are increased in dystrophic muscle from all species evaluated. Dystrophic mice and dogs had significantly higher cross-linked collagen than controls especially in the diaphragm. Distribution of intramuscular LOX was heterogeneous in all samples but it increased in frequency and intensity in dystrophic muscle.

The aim of this study was to identify the neuro-motor control strategies adopted by patients with anterior shoulder instability during overhead shoulder elevation in two planes. METHODS The onset time of peak activation and peak magnitude of seven shoulder muscles posterior deltoid bilateral upper trapezius biceps brachii infraspinatus supraspinatus and teres major were identified using electromyography as 19 pre-operative patients with anterior shoulder instability mean 27.95 years SD 7.796 and 25 age-matched asymptomatic control subjects mean 23.07 years SD 2.952 elevated their arm above 90 degrees in the sagittal and coronal planes. RESULTS Temporal characteristics of time of muscle onsets were significantly different between groups expect for teres major in the coronal plane t 1.1220 p 0.2646 Patients recruited the rotator cuff muscles earlier and delayed the onset of ipsilateral upper trapezius compared with subjects p0.001 that control subjects. Furthermore significant alliances existed between the onsets of infraspinatus and supraspinatus sagittal r 0.720 coronal r 0.756 at p0.001 and ipsilateral upper trapezius and infraspinatus sagittal r -0.760 coronal r -0.818 at p0.001. The peak activation of all seven muscles occurred in the mid-range of elevation among patients with anterior shoulder instability whereas subjects spread peak activation of all 7 muscles throughout range. Peak magnitude of patients infraspinatus muscle was six times higher sagittal t -8.6428 coronal t -54.1578 at p0.001 but magnitude of their supraspinatus was lower sagittal t 36.2507 coronal t 35.9350 at p0.001 that subjects. CONCLUSIONS Patients with anterior shoulder instability adopted a stability before mobility neuro-motor control strategy to initiate elevation and a stability at all cost strategy to ensure concavity compression in the mid-to-150 degrees of elevation in both sagittal and coronal planes.",

The current study analyzed grapes primary and secondary metabolism across grapevine genotypes and seasons to reveal both conserved and variable impacts to GRBV infection. Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon CS grapevines grafted on two different rootstocks 110R and 420A were analyzed in 2016 and 2017. Metabolite profiling revealed a considerable impact on amino acid and malate acid levels volatile aroma compounds derived from the lipoxygenase pathway and anthocyanins synthesized in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Conserved transcriptional responses to GRBV showed induction of auxin-mediated pathways and photosynthesis with inhibition of transcription and translation processes mainly at harvest. There was an induction of plant-pathogen interactions at pre-veraison for all genotypes and seasons except for CS 110R in 2017. Lastly differential co-expression analysis revealed a transcriptional shift from metabolic synthesis and energy metabolism to transcription and translation processes associated with a virus-induced gene silencing transcript. This plant-derived defense response transcript was only significantly upregulated at veraison for all genotypes and seasons suggesting a phenological association with disease expression and plant immune responses.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of physical task-based assessments used to evaluate the multi-grasp dexterity and functional impact of varying control systems in pediatric and adult upper-limb prostheses. Our search returned 1442 research articles from online databases of which 25 tests-selected for their scientific rigor evaluation metrics and psychometric properties-met our review criteria. We observed that despite significant advancements in the mechatronics of upper-limb prostheses these 25 assessments are the only validated evaluation methods that have emerged since the first measure in 1948. This not only underscores the lack of a consistently updated standardized assessment protocol for new innovations but also reveals an unsettling trend as technology outpaces standardized evaluation measures developers will often support their novel devices through custom study-specific tests. These boutique assessments can potentially introduce bias and jeopardize validity. Furthermore our analysis revealed that current validated evaluation methods often overlook the influence of competing interests on test success. Clinical settings and research laboratories differ in their time constraints access to specialized equipment and testing objectives all of which significantly influence assessment selection and consistent use. Therefore we propose a dual testing approach to address the varied demands of these distinct environments. Additionally we found that almost all existing task-based assessments lack an integrated mechanism for collecting patient feedback which we assert is essential for a holistic evaluation of upper-limb prostheses. Our review underscores the pressing need for a standardized evaluation protocol capable of objectively assessing the rapidly advancing prosthetic technologies across all testing domains.",

    "abstract": "In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry were used to map distributions of cells expressing mRNAs encoding alpha beta gamma and delta isoforms of type II calciumcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase CaMKII alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate AMPA kainate receptor subunits GluR1-7 and N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2A-D or stained by subunit-specific immunocytochemistry in the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei of macaque monkeys. Relationships of specific isoforms with particular glutamate receptor types may be important elements in neural plasticity. CaMKII-alpha is expressed only by neurons in the S laminae and interlaminar plexuses of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus but may form part of a more widely distributed matrix of similar cells extending from the geniculate into adjacent nuclei. CaMKII-beta -gamma and -delta isoforms are expressed by all neurons in principal and S laminae and interlaminar plexuses. In principal laminae they are down-regulated by monocular deprivation lasting 8-21 days. All glutamate receptor subunits are expressed by neurons in principal and S laminae and interlaminar plexuses. The AMPAkainate subunits GluR1 2 5 and 7 are expressed at low levels although GluR1 immunostaining appears selectively to stain interneurons. GluR3 is expressed at weak GluR 6 at moderate and GluR 4 at high levels. NMDA subunits NR1 and NR2A B and D are expressed at moderate to low levels. GluR4 GluR6 and NMDA subunits are down-regulated by visual deprivation. CaMKII-alpha expression is unique in comparison with other CaMKII isoforms which may therefore have more generalized roles in cell function. The results demonstrate that all of the isoforms are associated with NMDA receptors and with AMPA receptors enriched with GluR4 subunits which implies high calcium permeability and rapid gating.",

Among the 184 isolates seven showed resistance to azoxystrobin. All these seven azoxystrobin-resistant AR isolates were also resistant to a benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim and a dicarboximide fungicide iprodione. Negative cross-resistance between azoxystrobin and a carboxamide fungicide boscalid was not observed in AR isolates of B. cinerea. Analysis structure of partial cytochrome b cyt b gene from B. cinerea showed that a 1204-bp intron inserted directly after the codon 143 of cyt b gene was detected from 79 out of 184 isolates and all the isolates having this intron were sensitive to azoxystrobin. This intron was not detected from any AR isolate. Sequence analysis of partial cyt b gene showed that all AR isolates had a point mutation at codon 143 which caused a change of glycine to alanine G143A at this codon position. Based on the point mutation an allele-specific PCR assay was developed for the rapid detection of AR isolates of B. cinerea. 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the scalability in arrayed waveguide grating router AWGR-based interconnect architectures and demonstrates active AWGR-based switching using a distributed control plane. First the paper analyses an all-to-all single AWGR passive interconnection with N nodes and proposes a new architecture that overcomes the scalability limitation given by wavelength registration and crosstalk by introducing multiples of smaller AWGRs W W operating on a fewer number of wavelengths W N. Second this paper demonstrates active AWGR switching with a distributed control plane to be used when the size of the interconnection network makes the all-to-all approach using passive AWGRs impractical. In particular an active AWGR-based TONAK switch is introduced. TONAK combines an all-optical NACK technique which removes the need for electrical buffers at the switch inputoutput ports and a TOKEN technique which enables a distributed all-optical arbiter to handle packet contention. The experimental validation and performance study of the AWGR-based TONAK switch is presented demonstrating the feasibility of the TONAK solution and the high throughput and low average packet latency for an up to 75 offered load. 2013 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction CR has been shown to decrease H2O2 production in liver mitochondria although it is not known if this is due to uniform changes in all mitochondria or changes in particular mitochondrial sub-populations. To address this issue liver mitochondria from control and CR mice were fractionated using differential centrifugation at 1000 g 3000 g and 10000 g into distinct populations labeled as M1 M3 and M10 respectively. Mitochondrial protein levels respiration and H2O2 production were measured in each fraction. CR resulted in a decrease in total protein mg in each fraction although this difference disappeared when adjusted for liver weight mg proteing liver weight. No differences in respiration State 3 or 4 were observed between control and CR mice in any of the mitochondrial fractions. CR decreased H2O2 production in all fractions when mitochondria respired on succinate Succ succantimycin A SuccAA or pyruvatemalaterotenone PMROT. Thus CR decreased reactive oxygen species ROS production under conditions which stimulate mitochondrial complex I ROS production under both forward PMROT and backward Succ SuccAA electron flow. The results indicate that CR decreases H2O2 production in all liver mitochondrial fractions due to a decrease in capacity for ROS production by complex I of the electron transport chain.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Diabetic retinopathy is a retinal vasculopathy involving all three retinal capillary plexus layers. Since human CD34 bone marrow stem cells BMSCs have the potential to promote revascularization of ischemic tissue this study tests the hypothesis that intravitreal injection of human CD34 BMSCs can have protective effects on all layers of the retinal vasculature in eyes with diabetic retinopathy. METHODS Streptozotocin STZ-induced diabetic mice were injected intravitreally with 50000 human CD34 BMSCs or phosphate-buffered saline PBS into the right eye. Systemic immunosuppression with rapamycin and tacrolimus was started 5 days before the injection and maintained for study duration to prevent rejection of human cells. All mice were euthanized 4 weeks after intravitreal injection both eyes were enucleated for retinal flat mount immunohistochemistry. The retinal vasculature was stained with Isolectin-GS-IB4. Confocal microscopy was used to image four circular areas of interest of retina 1-mm diameter around the optic disc. Images of superficial intermediate and deep retinal capillary plexus layers within the areas of interest were obtained and analyzed using ImageJ software with the Vessel Analysis plugin to quantitate the retinal vascular density and vascular length density in the three plexus layers. RESULTS Three distinct retinal capillary plexus layers were visualized and imaged using confocal microscopy. Eyes that received intravitreal injection of CD34 BMSCs N9 had significantly higher vascular density and vascular length density in the superficial retinal capillary plexus when compared to the untreated contralateral eyes N9 or PBS treated control eyes N12 P values 0.05 using ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests. For the intermediate and deep plexus layers the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The protective effect of intravitreal injection of the human CD34 BMSCs on the superficial retinal capillary plexus layers is demonstrated using confocal microscopy in this murine model of diabetic retinopathy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair EVAR is now established as first-line treatment for infrarenal aortic aneurysms in the United States. Recent data from randomized trials suggest that elective EVAR is cost-effective compared with open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair oAAA. Cost analysis for urgent aneurysm repair has not been reported. We evaluated the cost of elective and urgent EVAR and compared it with oAAA at a tertiary academic medical center. METHODS All infrarenal AAA repairs performed from 2004 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed n 172. Clinical characteristics of patients receiving EVAR and oAAA repair were compared. Direct costs payments and direct cost margin for the index inpatient episode were obtained from the hospital for all patients. Subsequent financial information including clinical radiologic and procedural cost was also available for 52 patients who had received all follow-up care in our institution for at least 1 year EVAR 34 oAAA 18. RESULTS Overall elective EVAR patients were older but oAAA patients had more comorbidities with significantly more patients having dyspnea at rest and being totally dependent for activities of daily living. EVAR patients had significantly shorter lengths of stay regardless of urgency and urgent AAA repair occurred more often by oAAA than EVAR P 0.001 2. For elective patients EVAR costs were 34.21 greater than for oAAA. There was a trend toward lower costs with EVAR versus oAAA in patients treated urgently by a ratio of 1.281. The hospital experienced a negative cost margin more often after elective EVAR versus oAAA. Negative cost margins were less frequent following urgent repair but still occurred twice as often in EVAR versus oAAA patients. Cost margins remained negative in all EVAR patients for at least 1 year and only 18 converted to a positive cost margin at a mean of 31 months. CONCLUSIONS At a tertiary academic institution costs for elective EVAR are significantly higher than oAAA. EVAR may be relatively more cost-effective in urgent situations. Negative cost margins were more common in EVAR patients and 1-year follow-up with imaging in the same institution did not result in a positive margin.",

    "abstract": "Two definitions of persistence despite perturbations in deterministic models are presented. The first definition persistence despite frequent small perturbations is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a positive attractor i.e. an attractor bounded away from extinction. The second definition persistence despite rare large perturbations is shown to be equivalent to permanence i.e. a positive attractor whose basin of attraction includes all positive states. Both definitions set up a natural dichotomy for classifying models of interacting populations. Namely a model is either persistent despite perturbations or not. When it is not persistent it follows that all initial conditions are prone to extinction due to perturbations of the appropriate type. For frequent small perturbations this method of classification is shown to be generically robust there is a dense set of models for which persistent respectively extinction prone models lies within an open set of persistent resp. extinction prone models. For rare large perturbations this method of classification is shown not to be generically robust. Namely work of Josef Hofbauer and the author have shown there are open sets of ecological models containing a dense sets of permanent models and a dense set of extinction prone models. The merits and drawbacks of these different definitions are discussed.",

Yet biologically meaningful interpretations are often limited by the poor spatial and temporal resolution of the acquired data sets. One way to remedy this is to limit the complexity of the cell types being studied. Cucurbita maxima Duch. vascular exudates provide an excellent material for metabolomics in this regard. Using automated mass spectral deconvolution over 400 components have been detected in these exudates but only 90 of them were tentatively identified. Many amino compounds were found in vascular exudates from leaf petioles at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than in tissue disks from the same leaves whereas hexoses and sucrose were found in far lower amounts. In order to find the expected impact of assimilation rates on sugar levels total phloem composition of eight leaves from four plants was followed over 4.5 days. Surprisingly no diurnal rhythm was found for any of the phloem metabolites that was statistically valid for all eight leaves. Instead each leaf had its own distinct vascular exudate profile similar to leaves from the same plant but clearly different from leaves harvested from plants at the same developmental stage. Thirty to forty per cent of all metabolite levels of individual leaves were different from the average of all metabolite profiles. Using metabolic co-regulation analysis similarities and differences between the exudate profiles were more accurately characterized through network computation specifically with respect to nitrogen metabolism.",

A raised garden box was provided for growing vegetables. The intake of food in targeted categories was encouraged through lectures discussions behavior self-monitoring cards goal setting and social interactions. Pre- and post-test measures of dietary behaviors and attitudes related to nutrition and to gardening were collected. The project was conducted at an initial location and then replicated in the second year at two other sites. Significant changes in the intake of food in targeted categories were noted at all locations and scores on attitudinal measures also improved among seniors at all sites.

OBJECTIVES Our objectives are to describe the process of food pattern modeling FPM conducted to develop FBDGs for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 for infants 6 to 12 mo and toddlers 12 to 24 mo of age as well as the implications of the results and areas needing further work. METHODS The US 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee with the support of federal staff conducted FPM analyses using 5 steps 1 identified energy intake targets 2 established nutritional goals 3 identified food groupings and expected amounts using 3 options for the amount of energy from human milk in each age interval 4 estimated expected nutrient intakes for each scenario based on nutrient-dense representative foods and 5 evaluated expected nutrient intakes against nutritional goals. RESULTS For human milk-fed infants and toddlers example combinations of complementary foods and beverages were developed that come close to meeting almost all nutrient recommendations if iron-fortified infant cereals are included at 6 to 12 mo of age. These combinations would also be suitable for formula-fed infants. For toddlers not fed human milk 2 patterns were developed the Healthy US-Style Pattern and the Healthy Vegetarian Pattern a lacto-ovo vegetarian pattern. Achieving nutrient recommendations left virtually no remaining energy for added sugars. CONCLUSIONS It is challenging to meet all nutrient needs during these age intervals. Added sugars should be avoided for infants and toddlers 2 y of age. Further work is needed to 1 establish a reference human milk composition profile 2 update and strengthen the DRI values for these age groups and 3 use optimization modeling in combination with FPM to identify combinations of foods that meet all nutritional goals.",

The next generation of targeted therapies includes the use of antibodies conjugated to potent cytotoxic agents and are classified as antibody drug conjugates ADC. For B-lineage ALL CD22 is an ideal target for ADC therapy because it is expressed on the majority of B-lineage ALL cells and because antibody binding mediates receptor internalization. HB22.7-SAP is a conjugate of our anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody mAb HB22.7 and the ribosome inhibiting protein saporin SAP. In vitro HB22.7-SAP effectively bound to CD22 on the surface of pre-B ALL cell lines and exhibited potent and specific cytotoxicity. In a NODSCID xenograft mouse model of pre-B ALL when compared to the vehicle-treated control HB22.7-SAP increased the median survival time from 20 days to over 50 days without significant toxicity.",

CD22 is a valid target for immunotherapy of NHL and ALL. We have shown that the anti-CD22 ligand blocking monoclonal antibody mAb HB22.7 has significant activity. Antibody drug conjugates ADC are emerging as the next generation of targeted therapies for lymphoid neoplasms as they may be designed to be effective but with manageable toxicity. We sought to determine if HB22.7 could be used as a platform for CD22-targeted ADCs for the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms. We describe here the effect H22.7-saporin SAP a novel ADC composed of HB22.7 and a ribosome inactivating protein on ALL and NHL models.jatsp jatspThe in vitro cytotoxicity of HB22.7-SAP was assessed using two pre-B cell ALL lines REH and JM1 and NHL cell lines Ramos Raji Granta 519 SU-DHL-4 and DOHH-2. HB22.7-SAP had IC50 values of 0.7 and 1.2 ngmL in ALL and 1.08.4 ngmL in the NHL cell lines. Free HB22.7 plus SAP did not have any cytotoxic effect using the same doses. HB22.7-SAP was not cytotoxic to CD22 negative Jurkat cells.jatsp jatspTo evaluate HB22.7-SAPs in vivo efficacy against a model of human ALL NODSCID mice were injected with REH leukemia cells. Twenty-four hours later the mice were treated with PBS free HB22.7 plus SAP or HB22.7-SAP. Treatment was continued twice weekly for 4 weeks. Mice were euthanized at the onset of hind limb paralysis. The median survival was 52 days as compared to 20 days for the untreated mice p lt 0.0005. Mice treated with HB22.7-SAP had normal blood counts over the study period. In contrast mice from the PBS or free HB22.7 plus free SAP groups developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia by day 20 coincident with development of ALL bone marrow from the two mice that developed hind limb paralysis confirmed ALL.jatsp jatspTo assess efficacy in a human model of NHL Raji cells were injected into the flank of previously radiated female athymic nude mice. Tumors grew until they reached 100200 mm3 day 0. Mice were then exposed to HB22.7-SAP PBS or free HB22.7 plus free SAP. Each treatment was administered intraperitoneally weekly for 3 weeks. To assess significance of starting tumor volume on HB22.7-SAP-mediated tumor growth inhibition a second model initiated therapy 24 hours after tumor implantation and used the same dose and drug schedule. During the first 14 days HB22.7-SAP 1 mgkg significantly inhibited tumor growth p lt 0.01 on days 5 and 8 as compared to the PBS and free HB22.7 plus free SAP control groups however by day 19 the average tumors volume of mice treated with HB22.7-SAP were no different than the controls. In contrast when HB22.7-SAP was administered 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of Raji cells no mice in the treatment group developed measureable tumors in the 50-day study period. There was no difference in hematologic toxicity between the groups however mice treated with HB22.7-SAP had more therapy-related weight loss.jatsp jatspThis study demonstrates the promising in vivo and in vitro activity of HB22.7 when used as a platform for CD22-targeted ADCs. The HB22.7-SAP ADC is both specific and cytotoxic to CD22 expressing malignant lymphocytes and that translates into significant efficacy against NHL and ALL. When compared to other anti-CD22 mAb we hypothesize that HB22.7-based ADCs will prove to be potent cytotoxic drugs in-part due to their unique ability to block ligand binding thus conferring an independent lymphocidal property.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that ionizing radiation can enhance immune responses to tumors. Advances in radiation delivery techniques allow hypofractionated delivery of conformal radiotherapy. Hypofractionation or other modifications of standard fractionation may improve radiations ability to promote immune responses to tumors. Other novel delivery options may also affect immune responses including T-cell activation and tumor-antigen presentation changes. However there is limited understanding of the immunological impact of hypofractionated and unique multifractionated radiotherapy regimens as these observations are relatively recent. Hence these differences in radiotherapy fractionation result in distinct immune-modulatory effects. Radiation oncologists and immunologists convened a virtual consensus discussion to identify current deficiencies challenges pitfalls and critical gaps when combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy and making recommendations to the field and advise National Cancer Institute on new directions and initiatives that will help further development of these two fields.This commentary aims to raise the awareness of this complexity so that the need to study radiation dose fractionation type and volume is understood and valued by the immuno-oncology research community. Divergence of approaches and findings between preclinical studies and clinical trials highlights the need for evaluating the design of future clinical studies with particular emphasis on radiation dose and fractionation immune biomarkers and selecting appropriate end points for combination radiationimmune modulator trials recognizing that direct effect on the tumor and potential abscopal effect may well be different. Similarly preclinical studies should be designed as much as possible to model the intended clinical setting. This article describes a conceptual framework for testing different radiation therapy regimens as separate models of how radiation itself functions as an immunomodulatory drug to provide alternatives to the widely adopted one-size-fits-all strategy of frequently used 8 Gy3 regimens immunomodulation.",

    "abstract": "The energy crisis and environmental protection are gaining increasing concern in recent years. ICT Information and Communication Technology has a significant impact on the total electricity consumption all over the world. Telecom networks being an important part of ICT consume significant energy since more network equipment is deployed annually. Specifically in IP-over-WDM networks energy is consumed by network elements at both IP and WDM layers. Routers in the IP layer are the largest energy consumer in this architecture and current network infrastructures have no energy-saving scheme so a large amount of energy is wasted when traffic load is low. In this paper we propose a novel approach to save energy in IP-over-WDM networks by shutting down idle line cards and chassis of routers based on time-of-the-day network traffic variation. A method based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming MILP is proposed to ensure that the energy cost incurred by the IP routers and optical cross-connects is minimized by our approach. We also propose some possible approaches to minimize potential traffic disruption when the network elements are shut down. 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Cubitus varus deformity is the most common complication after the treatment of displaced supracondylar humerus fractures. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed evaluating patients who had undergone a translation step-cut osteotomy for correction of cubitus varus deformity between 1993 and 2008. Postoperative radiographs to union were reviewed for all patients. Subjective information and range of motion measures were documented from the medical records. Patients and their families were also contacted through telephone and administered a questionnaire as well as the QuickDash functional outcome measure to assess their function and satisfaction. RESULTS Thirty-seven participants were identified and reviewed. Average age at the time of surgery was 8 years and 10 months with an average follow-up of 2 years and 4 months. Outcomes were assessed in terms of technical functional and satisfaction domains. Technical Domain Average humeroulnar angle radiographic carrying angle correction was 26 degrees. Baumans angle improved 21 degrees on average in patients who were skeletally immature. Functional Domain Elbow range of motion was maintained in all planes with few exceptions. The clinical carrying angle improved 26 degrees on average and was symmetric with the unaffected side in 22 of 25 cases in which it was documented. The QuickDash was applied to 15 participants. Eight participants had perfect scores for the symptomsdisability section and 7 had scores in the top 20 for function. Satisfaction Domain A study-specific questionnaire was applied to 16 participants. All patients and parents questioned would recommend the procedure to other parentspatients. CONCLUSION The translation step-cut osteotomy reliably corrects the coronal plane angular deformity associated with cubitus varus resulting in excellent outcomes in technical functional and satisfaction domains. The osteotomy is relatively simple to perform and is inherently more stable than other proposed methods. It also minimizes the prominence of the lateral condyle associated with simple lateral closing wedge osteotomy.",

Our previous economic evaluation demonstrated tele-ICU to be cost-effective in most cases and cost saving in some cases compared to conventional intensive care unit ICU care without adequate intensivist coverage. INTRODUCTION This studys objective is to examine how to optimize the cost-effectiveness of tele-ICU use by selecting highest risk i.e. both highest mortality and highest cost subpopulations. We also explore potential cost savings. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted simulation analyses among a hypothetical adult ICU patient cohort defined by the literature distinguishing four types of hospitals urban tertiary primary analysis urban community rural tertiary and rural community. The selected tele-ICU use was assumed to affect per-patient ICU cost and hospital mortality among highest risk subpopulations 10-100 of all ICU patients defined by an established illness-severity measure. RESULTS We found a U-shaped relationship between the economic efficiency and selected tele-ICU use among all 4 hospital types. Optimal cost-effectiveness was achieved when tele-ICU was applied to the 30-40 highest risk patients among all ICU patients incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 25392 2014 U.S. dollars per extending a quality-adjusted life year in urban tertiary hospitals primary analysis. Our break-even analyses indicated that cost saving seems more feasible when reducing ICU medical care cost rather than lowering the cost to operate telemedicine alone. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS A selected use of tele-ICU based on severity of illness is likely to improve tele-ICU cost-effectiveness. To achieve cost saving tele-ICU must reduce more than just telemedicine-related cost.",

We have analyzed longitudinal IQ data on all 24 fragile X males who have been followed for at least 2 years through the Child Development Unit in Denver and who have been evaluated with a Stanford-Binet Form L-M assessment. A significant drop in IQ occurred for the group as a whole but an individual z analysis demonstrated that only 7 of 24 had a significant decline in IQ. Visual inspection demonstrates an initial decline in IQ beginning in middle childhood and continuing through adolescence. We postulate that this drop occurs because of relatively greater weaknesses with abstract reasoning and higher symbolic language skills that are stressed in the cognitive testing of later childhood and adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Reintroduction of endangered fishes to historic habitat has been used as a recovery tool however these fish may face competition from other fishes that established in their native habitat since extirpation. This study investigated the physiological response of tidewater goby Eucyclogobius newberryi an endangered California fish when competing for food with threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus a native species and rainwater killifish Lucania parva a non-native species. Survival growth and physiological indicators of stress i.e. cortisol glucose and lactate concentrations were assessed for juvenile fish held for 28 days in two food-limited conditions. When fed a 75 ration survival of E. newberryi was significantly lower when held with G. aculeatus. In all fish assemblages weight and relative condition decreased then stabilized over the 28 day experiment while length remained unchanged. Whole-body cortisol in E. newberryi was not affected by fish assemblage however glucose and lactate concentrations were significantly higher with conspecifics than with other fish assemblages. When fed a 50 ration survival of E. newberryi decreased during the second half of the experiment while weight and relative condition decreased and length remained unchanged in all three fish assemblages. Cortisol concentrations were significantly higher for all fish assemblages compared with concentrations at the start of the experiment whereas glucose and lactate concentrations were depressed relative to concentrations at the start of the experiment with the magnitude of decrease dependent on the species assemblage. Our findings indicate that E. newberryi exhibited reduced growth and an elevated generalized stress response during low food availability. In response to reduced food availability competition with G. aculeatus had the greatest physiological effect on E. newberryi with minimal effects from the non-native L. parva. This study presents the first reported cortisol glucose and lactate concentrations in response to chronic stress for E. newberryi.",

    "abstract": "Graphene is considered a leading candidate to replace conventional transparent conducting electrodes because of its high transparency and exceptional transport properties. The effect of chemical p-type doping on graphene stacks was studied in order to reduce the sheet resistance of graphene films to values approaching those of conventional transparent conducting oxides. In this report we show that large-area stacked graphene films are effectively p-doped with nitric acid. The doping decreases the sheet resistance by a factor of 3 yielding films comprising eight stacked layers with a sheet resistance of 90 Omegasquare at a transmittance of 80. The films were doped either after all of the layers were stacked last-layer-doped or after each layer was added interlayer-doped. A theoretical model that accurately describes the stacked graphene film system as a resistor network was developed. The model defines a characteristic transfer length where all the channels in the graphene films actively contribute to electrical transport. The experimental data shows a linear increase in conductivity with the number of graphene layers indicating that each layer provides an additional transport channel in good agreement with the theoretical model.",

    "abstract": "The cumulative incidence risk factors rate of subsequent venous thromboembolism VTE and bleeding and impact on mortality of isolated upper extremity deep vein thrombosis UE DVT in acute leukemia are not well-described. The California Cancer Registry used to identify treated patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL diagnosed between 2009 and 2014 was linked with the statewide hospitalization database to determine cumulative incidences of UE DVT and subsequent VTE and bleeding after UE DVT diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association of UE DVT on the risk of subsequent pulmonary embolism PE or lower extremity deep vein thrombosis LE DVT and subsequent bleeding and the impact of UE DVT on mortality. There were 5072 patients identified 3252 had AML and 1820 had ALL. Three- and 12-month cumulative incidences of UE DVT were 4.8 95 confidence interval CI 4.1-5.6 and 6.6 95 CI 5.8-7.5 for AML and 4.1 95 CI 3.2-5.1 and 5.9 95 CI 4.9-7.1 for ALL respectively. Twelve-month cumulative incidences of subsequent VTE after an incident UE DVT diagnosis were 5.3 for AML and 12.2 for ALL. Twelve-month cumulative incidences of subsequent bleeding after an incident UE DVT diagnosis were 15.4 for AML and 21.1 for ALL. UE DVT was associated with an increased risk of subsequent bleeding for both AML hazard ratio HR 2.07 95 CI 1.60-2.68 and ALL HR 1.62 95 CI 1.02-2.57 but was not an independent risk factor for subsequent PE or LE DVT for either leukemia subtype. Isolated incident UE DVT was associated with increased leukemia-specific mortality for AML HR 1.42 95 CI 1.16-1.73 and ALL HR 1.80 95 CI 1.31-2.47. UE DVT is a relatively common complication among patients with AML and ALL and has a significant impact on bleeding and mortality. Further research is needed to determine appropriate therapy for this high-risk population.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The California End of Life Option Act EOLOA which legalized physician-assisted death PAD became effective in 2016. The EOLOA does not require a mental health consultation in all cases nor does it state the standards for the mental health assessment. University of California San Francisco Medical Center UCSFMC policy makers decided to require a mental health assessment of all patients seeking PAD under the EOLOA. OBJECTIVES The Department of Psychiatry was tasked with developing a standard protocol for the mental health assessment of patients seeking PAD. METHODS Members of the consultation-liaison C-L service developed a document to guide members in completing the mental health evaluations for patients requesting PAD. RESULTS A committee at UCSFMC developed a clinical protocol informed by the law with an additional local expectation of an evaluation by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. The C-L psychiatry group at UCSF developed a standard protocol for the psychiatric assessment for use by clinicians performing these assessments. Attention to the cognitive mood and decisional capacity status pertinent to choosing PAD is required under the clinical guidance document. Case vignettes of 6 patients evaluated for PAD are presented. CONCLUSIONS The local adoption of the California EOLOA by UCSFMC requires a mental health assessment of all patients requesting EOL services at UCSF. The clinical guideline for these assessments was locally developed informed by the literature on EOL in other jurisdictions where it has already been available.",

The first member of this family encoded by the cruA gene of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum was identified in a complementation assay with a lycopene-producing strain of Escherichia coli. Orthologs of cruA are found in all available green sulfur bacterial genomes and in all cyanobacterial genomes that lack genes encoding CrtL- or CrtY-type lycopene cyclases. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 has two homologs of CruA denoted CruA and CruP and both were shown to have lycopene cyclase activity. Although all characterized lycopene cyclases in plants are CrtL-type proteins genes orthologous to cruP also occur in plant genomes. The CruA- and CruP-type carotenoid cyclases are members of the FixC dehydrogenase superfamily and are distantly related to CrtL- and CrtY-type lycopene cyclases. Identification of these cyclases fills a major gap in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways of green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Genes limited to particular clades taxonomically restricted genes TRGs are common in all sequenced genomes. TRGs have recently become associated with the evolution of novelty as numerous studies across the tree of life have now linked expression of TRGs with novel phenotypes. However TRGs that underlie ancient lineage specific traits have been largely omitted from discussions of the general importance of TRGs. Here it is argued that when all TRGs are considered it is apparent that TRGs are fundamental to biology and evolution and likely play many complementary roles to the better understood toolkit genes. Genes underlying photosynthesis and skeletons for example are examples of commonplace fundamental TRGs. Essentially although basic cell biology has a highly conserved genetic basis across the tree of life most major clades also have lineage specific traits central to their biology and these traits are often based on TRGs. In short toolkit genes underlie what is conserved across organisms while TRGs define in many cases what is unique. An appreciation of the importance of TRGs will improve our understanding of evolution by triggering the study of neglected topics in which TRGs are of paramount importance.",

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review was conducted at four Voice and Swallowing centers to identify patients who had a suboptimal injection of calcium hydroxylapatite during augmentation laryngoplasty. RESULTS Five patients ages 19-75 were identified with an impaired voice secondary to a superficial injection of calcium hydroxylapatite or over-medialization of the true vocal fold. All patients underwent revision surgery with all experiencing subjective and objective improvement. CONCLUSION Microflap excision can lead to successful return of vibratory function after a suboptimal injection of calcium hydroxylapatite. Complete control of the initial injection is paramount to avoiding this complication.",

    "abstract": "In the Western United States volcanic spring-fed rivers are anticipated to become increas-ingly more important for salmonids and other native fishes as these rivers will retain coldwater habitats as the climate warms. Despite this little is known about the hydro-biogeochemical interactions within these ecosystems. A review of existing literature on spring-fed rivers coupled with a decade of research on volcanic spring-fed rivers of northern California finds that these systems are exceptionally productive and exhibit stable environmental conditions. These unique conditions stem from hydrogeologic processes typical of young volcanic terrains. Aquatic macrophytes com-mon to some nutrient-rich spring-fed systems play a disproportionate role in hydrologic and geo-morphic processes by facilitating ecological interactions and velocity conditions that improve juvenile salmonid growth. We find that volcanic spring-fed rivers are also resilient to climate change due not only to their ability to dampen water temperature changes through deep groundwater flow but also because of their nutrient-driven high ecosystem productivity which may enable coldwater species to metabolically compensate for marginal increases in water temperature. Understanding the fundamental geomorphic and ecological differences between these rare ecosystems and their numerically dominant runoff rivers is essential for developing long-term conservation strategies for coldwater species under a rapidly changing climate.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To assess the relation of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis OA knee pain and radiographic knee OA to All-cause mortality and to identify mediators in the causal pathway. METHODS Participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were divided into 4 groups 1 symptomatic knee OA i.e. both radiographic knee OA KellgrenLawrence grade 2 and knee pain 2 knee pain only 3 radiographic knee OA only and 4 neither radiographic knee OA nor knee pain. We examined the relation of knee OA status to All-cause mortality using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and assessed the extent to which the association was mediated by disability physical component summary PCS and mental component summary MCS scores for quality of life QoL and use of oral pain-relief medications i.e. nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and opioids. RESULTS Among 4796 participants 282 died over the 96-month follow-up period. Compared with those with neither radiographic knee OA nor knee pain multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios HRs of mortality were 2.2 95 confidence interval 95 CI 1.6-3.1 for symptomatic knee OA 0.9 95 CI 0.6-1.4 for knee pain only and 2.0 95 CI 1.4-2.9 for radiographic knee OA only respectively. Indirect effects HRs of symptomatic knee OA on mortality via disability and PCS of QoL were 1.1 95 CI 1.0-1.4 and 1.2 95 CI 1.0-1.4 respectively. No apparent mediation effect was observed through either MCS of QoL or oral pain-relief medications use. CONCLUSION Participants with either symptomatic or radiographic knee OA were at an increased risk of All-cause mortality. Increased risk of mortality from symptomatic knee OA was partially mediated through its effect on disability and PCS of QoL.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The majority of recalls from screening mammography do not result in biopsy recommendation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if calcifications recalled from screening mammography are more likely to result in biopsy recommendations than other findings. METHODS IRB-approved electronic medical record search was performed to obtain a random sample of screening mammograms assigned BI-RADS 0 assessment during 2014-2015. Primary reason for recall was classified as mass asymmetry focal asymmetry calcifications or distortion. Primary outcome was biopsy performed after diagnostic work-up. Secondary outcome was proportion of biopsies performed that were positive for cancer positive predictive value 3 PPV3. Logistic regression was used to compare reasons for recall calcifications vs other findings with biopsy recommendation proportions. RESULTS Random database sampling yielded 402 screening examinations with BI-RADS 0 assessments with 449 total findings. Reasons for recall included calcifications 14.0 63449 masses 15.8 71449 asymmetries 50.8 228449 focal asymmetries 14.3 64449 and architectural distortions 5.1 23449. Overall 21.6 of recalls led to image-guided biopsy 87402. Recalls for calcifications were more likely to result in biopsy compared with other types of findings Adjusted OR 8.56 95 CI 4.58 to 16.0 p 0.001. No statistically significant differences were found in PPV3 proportions between calcification and non-calcification findings p 0.812. CONCLUSION Recalls for calcifications are much more likely to undergo biopsy compared with other findings. Increased biopsy rates for calcifications should be considered when recalling a patient from mammography screening in the context of practice specific positive predictive values and cancer detection rates.",

Newman 2006 proposed that singular concepts which support the tracing of individual objects across their existence are governed by a principle of causal continuity. They purported to show that causal continuity is better than existing theories at explaining judgments of the persistence of individual objects. This article makes 3 points. First the construct of causal connectedness entails a wide variety of different explanatory factors calling them all causal has questionable explanatory value. There is little evidence that the ultimate basis for identity judgments in many cases is causal. Second the authors suggest that causal knowledge is indeed important to identity but that it is important in the context of sortal concepts different causal information matters for different kinds of things. Finally the authors consider whether causal knowledge or sortal concepts are more fundamental to tracing individual identity that is whether causal knowledge is necessary for identity judgments. The authors appeal to research in developmental psychology that has begun to address this debate supporting the primacy of sortal concepts. Although there continues to be shortcomings of all theories of object persistence it is not clear that the causal continuer theory brings new clarity to the puzzle.",

We examined whether outcomes associated with these Leapfrog Group volume thresholds are comparable for patients at the extremes of age and comorbidities. METHODS We assessed lung cancer patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy in the New York and Florida State Inpatient Databases for 2007 to 2013. Multivariate logit models evaluated in-hospital mortality complications and prolonged length of stay. Median surgeon and hospital volumes were compared between younger-healthier age 18-60 years Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 1 and older-sicker patients age 77 years Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 3. RESULTS The 27841 patients included 13277 men 48. The median patient age was 69 years interquartile range 61-77 and mortality was 2.1. Patients treated by both low-volume surgeons 15 annual cases and at low-volume hospitals 40 had the greatest risk of mortality 2.5 except for the cohort of younger-healthier patients mortality 2. Mortality for older-sicker patients was highest for high-volume surgeons 12 although higher hospital volume was protective.

This study compared microsatellite analysis fatty acid profiling phenolic profiling and NMR fingerprinting for differentiating cultivars of California-style olives. Methods were tested on domestic Manzanilla domestic Sevillano imported Hojiblanca and imported Gordal olives. Microsatellites were successfully amplified in all cultivars except Hojiblanca and SevillanoGordal were found to be genetically-related possibly synonyms for the same genetic cultivar. Coupled with multivariate statistics fatty acid profiling differentiated the three genetically-distinct cultivars and NMR fingerprinting differentiated all four cultivars. Phenolic profile showed too much variability for effective discrimination. Future work includes expanding current models by size cultivars and type of table olive. We compared genetic and metabolite analyses for differentiating cultivars of processed olives. Two cultivars were identical for all SSRs tested and are possibly synonyms for the same cultivar. Fatty acid-profiling robustly differentiated genetically-distinct cultivars. Phenolic profiling was not a reliable method for differentiation due to processing effects. Untargeted NMR fingerprinting effectively differentiated all cultivars.",

This paper analyzes intercept survey data from 1247 transit riders in the San Francisco Bay Area to explore how mode choices and travel experiences differ for low-income immigrants compared to higher-income immigrants and US-born residents. We find that some public transit experiences are similar across all immigrant status and income groups while in other ways low-income immigrants differ from their higher-income counterparts or from US-born respondents. In particular low-income immigrants were less likely to have a bus pass or bicycle access. They were far more likely to substitute driving for taking public transit than all other immigrant and income groups. The results underscore the importance of collecting data on country of origin together with travel behavior data because many experiences are more burdensome for low-income immigrants.",

DESIGN Reanalysis of the baseline prediction model for the development of POAG from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study OHTS substituting IOP adjusted for CCT using 5 different correction formulae for unadjusted IOP. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1433 of 1636 participants randomized to OHTS who had complete baseline data for factors in the prediction model age IOP CCT vertical cup-to-disc ratio VCDR and pattern standard deviation PSD. METHODS Reanalysis of the prediction model for the risk of developing POAG using the same baseline variables age IOP CCT VCDR and PSD except that IOP was adjusted for CCT using correction formulae. A separate Cox proportional hazards model was run using IOP adjusted for CCT by each of the 5 formulae published to date. Models were run including and excluding CCT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Predictive accuracy of each Cox proportional hazards model was assessed using the c-statistic and calibration chi-square. RESULTS C-statistics for prediction models that used IOP adjusted for CCT by various formulas ranged from 0.75 to 0.77 no better than the original prediction model 0.77 that did not adjust IOP for CCT. Calibration chi-square was acceptable for all models. Baseline IOP whether adjusted for CCT or not was statistically significant in all models including those with CCT in the same model. The CCT was statistically significant in all models including those with IOP adjusted for CCT in the same model. CONCLUSIONS The calculation of individual risk for developing POAG in ocular hypertensive individuals is simpler and equally accurate using IOP and CCT as measured rather than applying an adjustment formula to correct IOP for CCT.",

    "abstract": "This chapter describes the plasma binding of vitamin B6 compounds. Vitamin B6 compounds are bound by plasma albumin. The various forms of B6 are bound with different affinities to plasma protein. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate pyridoxal-P is the most avidly bound form pyridoxal too is bound but less avidly and pyridoxine appears not to be bound at all. Binding of B6 compounds added to plasma or incubated with whole blood can be demonstrated by the protein fractionation of the plasma using gel filtration column chromatography. This method also allows separation of B6 forms into bound or free fractions without their modification or loss of identity. The detection of binding is based on the measurement of identifiable B6 in association with a protein. The B6 may be identified either by microbiologic assay or by radioactivity measurements if radiolabeled B6 is used. For demonstration of binding in plasma specimens pyridoxal-P is added to plasma and B6 measured by microbiologic assay after conversion to pyridoxal by acid hydrolysis. 1979 Elsevier Inc.

Infants remember the items they have attended to and perceived and their emotional state will influence their perception and representation of the events they encounter. Moreover by examining the development of the whole cognitive system or the whole child we gain a deeper understanding of mechanisms developmental change. Thus the big question for the study of infant cognition is like the question confronting all the kings horses and all the kings men How do we put the infants cognitive system back together again",

The contents of soluble solids total phenolics total flavonoids polysaccharides cyclic adenosine monophosphate 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and antioxidant activities were analyzed using the spectrophotometric method and high-performance liquid chromatography HPLC. Results showed that the antioxidant activities of all cultivars were significantly enhanced p .05 and the contents of selected bioactive compounds in all cultivars increased after blackening indicating that blackened jujube had higher nutritional value than red jujube. Correlation analysis showed that the total phenolic compounds were the primary source of jujube antioxidant activities.

This system based on the cellular retinoic acid binding protein is structurally different from natural rhodopsin systems but exhibits a similar isomerization upon light irradiation. More specifically M2 displays a 15-cis to all-trans conversion of retinal protonated Schiff base rPSB and all-trans to 15-cis isomerization of unprotonated Schiff base rUSB. Here we use hybrid quantum mechanicsmolecular mechanics QMMM tools coupled with transient absorption and cryokinetic UV-vis spectroscopies to investigate these isomerization processes. The results suggest that primary rPSB photoisomerization of M2 occurs around the C13C14 double bond within 2 ps following an aborted-bicycle pedal ABP isomerization mechanism similar to natural microbial rhodopsins. The rUSB isomerization is much slower and occurs within 48 ps around the C15N double bond. Our findings reveal the possibility to engineer naturally occurring mechanistic features into artificial rhodopsins and also constitute a step toward understanding the photoisomerization of UV pigments. We conclude by reinforcing the idea that the presence of the retinal chromophore inside a tight protein cavity is not mandatory to exhibit ABP mechanism.",

METHODS A data-set linking birth and death certificates with maternal and neonatal hospital discharge records in California was utilized to identify nulliparous women 11 to 29 years of age who delivered between January 11992 and December 311997. Pregnancy outcomes of early 11-15 year and late 16-19 year teenagers were compared to those of a control group of women aged 20-29. RESULTS Early n 31 232 and late teens n 271 470 demonstrated greater neonatal and infant mortality and major neonatal morbidities delivery 37 weeks of gestation and birthweight 2500 g when compared to pregnancies in the older control women n 662 752. Ethnicity adversely affected outcome with African-Americans of all ages having worse outcomes than whites. The higher rate of adverse obstetric outcomes among the teenage pregnancies occurred despite a lower cesarean section rate and was consistent across all ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS When compared to women aged 20-29 all teen pregnancies were associated with higher rates of poor obstetric outcomes. Other factors besides teen pregnancy appear to be responsible for poor outcomes in certain ethnic groups.",

Associations between reproductive risk factors and all-cause mortality after breast cancer diagnosis were assessed with the use of a population-based cohort of 3107 women of White European ancestry with invasive breast cancer 1130 from Melbourne and Sydney Australia 1441 from Ontario Canada and 536 from Northern California United States.

At recruitment questionnaire data were collected on oral contraceptive use number of full-term pregnancies age at first full-term pregnancy time from last full-term pregnancy to breast cancer diagnosis breastfeeding age at menarche and menopause and menopausal status at breast cancer diagnosis. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were estimated with the use of Cox proportional hazards models with and without adjustment for age at diagnosis study center education and body mass index. Compared with nulliparous women those who had a child up to 2 years or between 2 and 5 years before their breast cancer diagnosis were more likely to die. The unadjusted hazard ratio estimates were 2.75 95 confidence interval 95 CI 1.98-3.83 P 0.001 and 2.20 95 CI 1.65-2.94 P 0.001 respectively and the adjusted estimates were 2.25 95 CI 1.59-3.18 P 0.001 and 1.82 95 CI 1.35-2.46 P 0.001 respectively. When evaluating the prognosis of women recently diagnosed with breast cancer the time since last full-term pregnancy should be routinely considered along with other established host and tumor prognostic factors but consideration of other reproductive factors may not be warranted.",

All fish and shellfish were identified to species where possible. Anthropogenic debris was extracted from the digestive tracts of fish and whole shellfish using a 10 KOH solution and quantified under a dissecting microscope. In Indonesia anthropogenic debris was found in 28 of individual fish and in 55 of all species. Similarly in the USA anthropogenic debris was found in 25 of individual fish and in 67 of all species. Anthropogenic debris was also found in 33 of individual shellfish sampled. All of the anthropogenic debris recovered from fish in Indonesia was plastic whereas anthropogenic debris recovered from fish in the USA was primarily fibers.

    "abstract": "Abstract. Adetomyrma venatrix representing a new genus and species of ant is described from a single collection of twentyone workers from Zombitse Forest in western Madagascar. Remarkable features of its morphology include i absence of a petiole in dorsal view abdominal tergum 3 lacking a dorsally differentiated pretergite ii gaster large and expanded posteriorly all terga and sterna unfused and without constrictions iii absence of eyes and iv presence of a very large sting larger in relation to body size than that of any other known ant. Adetomyrma does not possess any of the derived features heretofore said to characterize the existing ant subfamilies. Morphological evidence suggests however that it is cladistically a member of the ponerine tribe Amblyoponini despite the absence of apomorphic abdominal characters tergosternal fusion of abdominal segments 3 and 4 seen in all other Ponerinae and in the more inclusive poneroid group of subfamilies. Whether Adetomyrma shows primitive absence of such characters or secondary reversal to an unfused state has important implications for the higher phylogeny of the ants. There is insufficient evidence to choose decisively between these two alternatives but in either case the monophyly of the ant subfamily Ponerinae becomes doubtful. Copyright 1994 Wiley Blackwell.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To assess feasibility of flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing FEES in awake dogs determine whether specific variables associated with the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing can be recognized and evaluate the safety and tolerability of FEES. ANIMALS 6 healthy client-owned large- and giant-breed adult dogs. PROCEDURES A topical anesthetic was applied to the nasal passage of each dog and a fiberoptic endoscope was passed transnasally until the tip of the scope was positioned in the oropharynx. All dogs voluntarily drank colored water followed by consumption of a commercial canned diet and then a kibble diet mixed with food color. During each swallow laryngeal and pharyngeal anatomic structures were evaluated and depth of bolus flow prior to the pharyngeal phase of swallowing was assessed. Evidence of bolus retention in the vallecula or pyriform sinuses and laryngeal penetration of the bolus were recorded. RESULTS FEES was completed without major adverse events and was tolerated well by all 6 dogs. Mild self-limiting epistaxis was noted for 2 dogs. The nasopharynx oropharynx and hypopharynx were observed in all dogs movement of food boluses through the esophagus was observed in 2 dogs and food boluses in the stomach were visible in 1 dog. Pharyngeal and laryngeal function was considered physiologically normal in all dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE FEES appeared to be a feasible diagnostic tool for use in large- and giant-breed dogs. Studies are warranted in dogs with oropharyngeal dysphagia to determine whether FEES can be tolerated and whether it can augment videofluoroscopy findings.",

    "abstract": "Molecular mechanics models have been applied extensively to study the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids. Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al. the charge set was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYPcc-pVTZHF6-31G quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme di-peptides calculated using MP2cc-pVTZHF6-31G quantum mechanical methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant of epsilon 4. We anticipate that this force field parameter set will address certain critical short comings of previous force fields in condensed-phase simulations of proteins. Initial tests on peptides demonstrated a high-degree of similarity between the calculated and the statistically measured Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides. Some highlights of our results include 1 well-preserved balance between the extended and helical region distributions and 2 favorable type-II poly-proline helical region in agreement with recent experiments. Backward compatibility between the new and Cornell et al. charge sets as judged by overall agreement between dipole moments allows a smooth transition to the new force field in the area of ligand-binding calculations. Test simulations on a large set of proteins are also discussed.",

White Matter Hyperintensities WMH are useful imaging findings that can be studied in elderly individuals and have been linked to an increased risk of neurological conditions such as stroke cognitive impairment and dementia. We performed a systematic review of literature using PubMed sources to compile all the studies that investigated the prevalence of ethnic and racial differences of WMH burden amongst diverse groups in the US. We identified 23 unique articles that utilized 16 distinct cohorts of which 94 were prospective longitudinal studies that included community-based and family-based populations. The overall results were heterogenous in all aspects of data collection and analysis limiting our ability to run meta-analyses and draw definitive conclusions. General observations suggest increased vascular risk on African American populations contributing to greater WMH burden in that population. Overall the findings of this study indicate a need for a standardized approach to investigating WMH in efforts to measure its clinical impact on diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To develop a web-based tool for daily use by agility handlers to log rating of perceived exertion RPE for dogs as an aid in quantifying daily exercise and training load and to improve training and conditioning strategies. PROCEDURES Focus group meetings with small groups of handlers were conducted via internet-based video conferencing using a semi-structured interview format. Meeting notes were coded for reflexive thematic analysis. The RPE logging tool was revised based on handler feedback. Each handler was asked to log their dogs daily RPE data for 1 week. Data were analyzed to assess compliance and timeliness of entries. Participants completed a post-logging questionnaire to provide feedback about their experiences. RESULTS Eighteen agility dog handlers participated in all phases of the project. Handler and dog demographics were similar to previously reported demographics of agility participants in the United States. Reflexive thematic analysis of their comments related to the initial draft RPE logging tool yielded 3 initial themes all of which supported a fourth and major theme the need for specific and detailed training resources before agility handlers utilized the RPE tool. Of 18 handlers 14 78 submitted logging records for the full week. Median time for data entry was 87 s IQR 56-117 s and 92 of logging records were entered within 1 day of the events which were being recorded. In the follow-up questionnaire the handlers did not identify any major concerns. Based on all available data from the handlers a final version of the RPE logging tool was produced. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Agility dog handlers are very interested in developing and validating tools to quantify training load for their dogs. The final RPE logging tool was quick and easy to use. Further validation of this logging tool is required with a larger number of handlers and comparison to physiologic data from exercising dogs.",

These techniques aim at reducing power or energy dissipation in all types of computer equipments while meeting a desired throughput. At the architectural level Power-aware design has been an active area of research in the last decade for superscalar processors. Simultaneous multithreading processor SMT introduced as a complementary architecture to superscalar to increase throughput has received less attention in the context of low-power design techniques. In SMT processors functional units are one of the major power consumers. In this paper we first study the opportunity for reducing the power consumption of functional units. Our results show that functional units are idle for a significant portion of the total execution cycle. Then we reuse and evaluate a microarchitectural technique to reduce functional unit power through power gating which has been recently proposed for superscalar processors. We show that in SMT processors this technique can reduce floating point unit power considerably while maintaining performance. 2005 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Warm-mix asphalt WMA technologies are added to asphalt binders to lower production and construction temperatures reduce emissions allow for increase haul distances and improve the workability. Reduced temperatures at the plant and during laydown and compaction are hypothesized to impact long-term oxidative aging behavior. This study attempted to quantify these impacts through characterization of field-aged unmodified and rubber-modified binders extracted and recovered from cores sampled from 13 test sections representing seven different WMA technologies and associated hot-mix controls. A dynamic shear rheometer DSR was used to evaluate the binder rheological properties at high temperatures with respect to expected rutting performance. The cup-and-bob DSR testing procedure was assessed as an alternative approach for testing rubberized binders. A bending beam rheometer BBR was used to characterize low-temperature properties. Test results did not appear to be influenced by the warm-mix technology chemistry. However the organic wax additive consistently showed better rutting resistance across all tests and this was attributed to the residual crystallization wax structure in the binder. All test results appeared to be influenced by production and placement temperatures indicating that some mixes produced at very low temperatures could be more susceptible to early rutting on pavements experiencing high ambient temperatures and high traffic loading. Air-void content appeared to have very little effect on the rheological properties of the extracted binder over the aging period assessed which was not expected. The results indicated that zero shear viscosity ZSV is a good indicator of the rheological behavior of asphalt binders with respect to rutting performance as observed from accelerated load testing. ZSV was also found to be more suitable for describing the rutting performance of rubberized binders than the current Superpave Gsin criterion. Viscosity-shear susceptibility is a suitable parameter for understanding the shear sensitivity of rubberized binders. It increases during long-term oxidative aging due to the increased association of polar compounds. The non-recoverable creep compliance and percent recovery parameters obtained from the multiple stress creep recovery test are useful parameters for understanding expected field rutting performance. Bending beam rheometer results indicated that the WMA technologies tested did not result in a grade change with respect to thermal cracking properties at low temperatures with all binders meeting the Superpave criteria at all ages tested. Performance trends for individual binders were consistent with rutting test results. The warm-mix additives and associated lower production and placement temperatures generally had limited effect on aging kinetics with respect to long-term field aging with the exception of the organic wax. Laboratory binder aging specifically the rolling thin film oven test did not always correspond to field performance.",

We hypothesize that targeted delivery of an MXD3 therapeutic to preB ALL cells will increase therapy effectiveness and decrease off target effects and toxicity thus increasing the quality of life.jatsp jatspIn the current study we developed an antisense oligonucleotide ASO that specifically targets MXD3. Taking advantage of anti-CD22 antibody aCD22 Ab which specifically targets B cell ALL we developed aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO conjugates as a potential combined phenotypic and molecularly targeted therapeutic. In in vitro tests using the Reh ALL cell line we confirmed successful delivery of the aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO compound to leukemia cells. This correlated with MXD3 knockdown at the protein level and inhibition of leukemia cell growth. Cytotoxicity was tested on anonymized healthy donor normal blood cells including CD34 positive hematopoietic stem cells HSCs B cells and non-B cells from mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As expected cytotoxicity was observed in normal B cells but CD34 HSCs and non-B cells were unaffected. In combination with conventional preB ALL chemotherapy drugs vincristine or doxorubin we observed additive cytotoxic effects of aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO conjugates on cells in vitro.jatsp jatspWe determined the compound effectiveness in pre-clinical xenograft animal models of preB ALL using both the Reh cell line as well as a primary leukemia sample. Age matched female NODSCIDIL2Rg-- NSG mice were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups 1 PBS 2 MXD3 ASO and aCD22 Ab unconjugated at the equivalent dose of the high dose group 3 aCD22 Ab-ASO conjugates at 0.2mg of Abkgdose and 4 at 1mg of Abkgdose. Five million leukemia cells were inoculated either intravenously iv Reh or intra-bone marrow primary cells to each mouse. Twenty-four hours following leukemia inoculation animals started receiving twice weekly iv treatments for 3 weeks. All mice treated with PBS and unconjugated MXD3 ASO amp aCD22 Ab died of leukemia at approximately day 21 in the Reh model and at day 30 in the primary leukemia model Figure. Animals treated with aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO conjugates either at low or high dose had significantly prolonged survival both in the Reh plt0.0084 n4group and primary leukemia p0.0001 n8group xenograft models Log-rank Mantel-Cox test. Leukemia-related death was confirmed by necropsy. Harvested leukemia cells were HLA and CD22 positive. During treatment the mice in all the treatment groups remained healthy and active and did not lose weight. Toxicity was assessed in the primary leukemia model with weekly CBC and chemistry panels and revealed no significant toxicity.jatsp jatspIn conclusion we have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of the aCD22 Ab-MXD3 ASO conjugates in preB ALL. This is the first study to demonstrate effective direct ASO-conjugated monoclonal Ab-mediated delivery for the treatment of leukemia or other malignancies. Future studies will focus on the further characterization of the compound effectiveness of combination therapy with standard chemotherapeutic drugs and toxicological profile.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Hereditary leukonychia porcelain nails or white nails is a rare nail disorder with an unknown genetic basis. To identify variants in a gene underlying this phenotype we identified four families of Pakistani origin showing features of hereditary leukonychia. All 20 nails of each affected individual were chalky and white in appearance consistent with total leukonychia with no other cutaneous appendageal or systemic findings. By using Affymetrix 10K chip we established linkage to chromosome 3p21.3-p22 with a LOD score Z of 5.1. We identified pathogenic mutations in PLCD1 in all four families which encodes phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C delta 1 subunit a key enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism. We then identified localization of PLCD1 in the nail matrix. It was recently shown that PLCD1 is a component of the human nail plate by proteomic analysis and is localized in the matrix of human nails. Furthermore mutations detected in PLCD1 resulted in reduced enzymatic activity in vitro. Our data show that mutations in PLCD1 underlie hereditary leukonychia revealing a gene involved in molecular control of nail growth.",

Esophageal cancers are histologically classified as squamous cell carcinoma SCC or adenocarcinoma which differ in their etiology pathology tumor location therapeutics and prognosis. In contrast to esophageal adenocarcinoma which usually affects the lower esophagus esophageal SCC is more likely to localize at or higher than the tracheal bifurcation. Systemic therapy can provide palliation improved survival and enhanced quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. The implementation of biomarker testing especially analysis of HER2 status microsatellite instability status and the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 has had a significant impact on clinical practice and patient care. Targeted therapies including trastuzumab nivolumab ipilimumab and pembrolizumab have produced encouraging results in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Palliative management which may include systemic therapy chemoradiation andor best supportive care is recommended for all patients with unresectable or metastatic cancer. Multidisciplinary team management is essential for all patients with locally advanced esophageal or esophagogastric junction cancers.

All clinical signs resolved in 18-48 hours with supportive care. One dog represented with similar clinical signs and biochemical abnormalities 3 days after discharge following spending time in a different rice field owned by the same owner. Toxicological analysis of serum from all 3 dogs and vomitus from 1 dog returned positive for amitraz and one of its metabolites. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED This is the first case series of dogs with confirmed amitraz toxicosis following an environmental exposure. Novel biochemical findings of hyperlactatemia respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis were documented in all 3 dogs. Clinicians should be concerned for amitraz toxicosis when presented with an animal with the constellation of signs including decreased mental status bradycardia and hyperglycemia particularly if relevant acid-base abnormalities are also detected.",

These cases show the need for clinicians evaluating patients in or recently returned from the tropics with acute febrile illness to consider both dengue and leptospirosis. Furthermore they illustrate the need for nucleic acid- or antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests to enable timely patient diagnosis and management.

OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to test the association between 25OHD PTH and mortality in older men. DESIGN AND SETTING The prospective Osteoporotic Fractures in Men MrOS study was conducted at six U.S. clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS We studied community-dwelling men at least 65 yr old n 1490. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Multivariate-adjusted proportional hazards models estimated the hazard ratio HR for mortality cause of death was classified as cancer cardiovascular and other by central review of death certificates. RESULTS During 7.3 yr of follow-up 330 22.2 participants died 97 from cancer 110 from cardiovascular disease and 106 from other causes. The adjusted HR per sd decrease in 25OHD for all-cause mortality was 1.01 95 CI 0.89 1.14 no association between 25OHD and cardiovascular or other-cause mortality was seen. Unexpectedly lower 25OHD levels were modestly associated with a decreased risk of cancer mortality adjusted HR per sd decrease 0.80 95 CI 0.64 0.99. Analyzing 25OHD as a categorical variable did not alter these results. Higher PTH levels log-transformed were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality adjusted HR per sd increase 1.15 95 CI 1.03 1.29 and cardiovascular mortality adjusted HR per sd increase in PTH 1.21 95 CI 1.00 1.45. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to previous studies lower 25OHD levels were not associated with an increased risk of all-cause or cause-specific mortality in older men. Higher PTH levels were associated with a modest increase in mortality risk.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The Stoppa intrapelvic approach has been introduced for the treatment of pelvic-acetabular fractures it allows easy exposure of the pelvic brim where the bone quality is optimal for screw fixation. The purpose of our study was to investigate the surgical outcomes of unstable pelvic ring injuries treated using the Stoppa approach for stable anterior ring fixation. METHODS We analyzed 22 cases of unstable pelvic ring injury treated with plate fixation of the anterior ring with the Stoppa approach. We excluded cases of nondisplaced rami fracture simple symphyseal diastasis and parasymphyseal fractures which can be easily treated with other techniques. The average age of the study patients was 41 years range 23 to 61 years. There were 10 males and 12 females. According to the Young and Burgess classification there were 12 lateral compression 4 anteroposterior compression and 6 vertical shear fracture patterns. The fracture location on the anterior ring was near the iliopectineal eminence in all cases and exposure of the pelvic brim was required for plate fixation. All patients were placed in the supine position. For anterior plate fixation all screws were applied to the anterior ramus distally and directed above the hip joint proximally. Radiologic outcomes were assessed by union time and quality of reduction by Matta method. The Merle dAubigne-Postel score was used to evaluate the functional results. RESULTS The average radiologic follow-up period was 16 months range 10 to 51 months. All fractures united at an average of 3.5 months range 3 to 5 months. According to the Matta method the quality of reduction was classified as follows 16 anatomical 73 and 6 nearly anatomical 27 reductions. There were no cases of screw or implant loosening before bone healing. The functional results were classified as 7 excellent 32 12 good 55 and 3 fair 13 by the Merle dAubigne-Postel score. There were no wound complications neurovascular injuries or other complications related to the surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS Stable anterior ring fixation placed via the Stoppa approach can result in excellent reduction and stable screw fixation with a low complication rate.",

    "abstract": "Primary neoplasms of the liver are rare in adolescents and young adults AYAs ages 1539 years accounting for only 1 of all neoplasms. Hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs are the most common liver tumor seen in AYAs as well as in older adults. Available SEER data have shown a steady increase in the incidence of liver and intrahepatic bile duct tumors between 1976 and 2011 for all age groups and for both sexes. Despite the improvement in diagnosis and treatment survival of patients with HCCs continues to be dismal. In contrast to older adults in whom almost all cases of HCCs are cirrhosis related secondary to viral infection or alcohol consumption less than a third of the AYA patients diagnosed with HCCs have an identifying cause such as hepatitis or other inflammatory liver diseases and therefore the treatment strategies differ significantly. Children and adolescents with HCC have been treated according to clinical trials designed for the treatment of childhood hepatoblastoma that includes chemotherapy and surgical resection or liver transplant when feasible. On the other hand treatment for adults with HCC has been based on the extent of disease and liver function. Treatment strategies can be divided in three groups 1 patients with localized disease early stage 2 patients with advanced disease as determined by the extensive hepatic involvement vascular invasion or presence of extrahepatic disease and 3 patients with significant liver dysfunction. Since these strategies are so different they are discussed separately in this chapter. Given the rarity of malignant liver tumors in the AYA population national and international collaboration will be essential to evaluate novel therapeutic approaches to establish the role of liver transplantation for these patients and to continue to improve our understanding of the biology of HCCs in this population.",

Nonetheless RCTs suffer important and underappreciated pitfalls some of which are intrinsic to the method when applied to economic problems others that are the result of methodological boosterism. Among the pitfalls are ethical dilemmas uncontrollable treatments that result in a faux exogeneity distortion of the research agenda and a tendency to estimate interventions abstract efficacy rather than their effectiveness in practice. We illustrate these points through the literature on smallholder capital access and productivity growth.

    "abstract": "Four bench-scale sequencing batch reactors SBRs seeded with activated sludge were operated under either fully oxic or anoxicoxic conditions and fed synthetic wastewater containing either peptone or acetate. The function of each reactor was assessed through the measure of i soluble chemical oxygen demand orthophosphate ammonia and nitrate and ii biomass concentrations of phosphorus polyhydroxyalkanoate guanosine tetraphosphate adenosine monophosphate adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate. In all four reactors the biomass concentration of phosphorous was correlated statistically with the biomass concentration of ppGpp. The microbial consortia in all four reactors removed an appreciable quantity of phosphorous from solution 67-99 and the net quantity of phosphorous removed from solution corresponded to the net increase in the biomass concentration of phosphorous. Hence the microbial stringent response MSR was associated with excess intracellular accumulation of phosphorous in mixed microbial consortia fed synthetic wastewater. With recognition of the potential role of the MSR in the removal of soluble phosphorous from wastewater additional research may lead to further optimization of treatment technologies and the development of new treatment systems for the biological removal of phosphorus from wastewater.",

HYPOTHESISOBJECTIVES Report the outcome of male dogs presented for urinary incontinence with UD treated with an artificial urethral sphincter AUS. ANIMALS Eight client-owned dogs with UD treated with an AUS. METHODS Multicenter retrospective study. Medical records from male dogs with urinary incontinence were reviewed. INCLUSION CRITERIA diagnosis of a UD by retrograde cystourethrography cystoscopy abdominal ultrasonography or contrast computed tomodensitometry CT or a combination of these modalities AUS placement and at least 1 follow-up. Urinary continence score UCS was attributed retrospectively. RESULTS Median UCS at presentation was 15. A contrast cystourethrogram was diagnostic in 88 dogs. All diverticula were saccular and 78 were within the prostatic urethra and 18 extended up to the membranous urethra. A congenital origin was suspected in 7 dogs and acquired in 1. Concurrent anomalies included renal dysplasia or chronic pyelonephritis n 4 bilateral cryptorchidism n 3 and pelvic urinary bladder n 3. All dogs were poorlymoderately responsive to phenylpropanolamine. Artificial urethral sphincter placement resulted in improvement in continence in all dogs with a median UCS of 45 55 in 28 dogs 45 in 58 dogs 35 in 18 dogs. CONCLUSION Urethral diverticulum should be considered in male dogs with persistent urinary incontinence not responding to medical management. Artificial urethral sphincter placement is an effective therapeutic option that improved continence scores in all dogs.",

    "abstract": "pWhile the health benefits of cycling and walking have been well established questions remain about whether these benefits hold in varying socioeconomic contexts including across demographic groups and in the context of neighborhood change. This study examines this relationship identifying associations between cycling or walking and self-reported health whether socioeconomic status moderates these associations and whether gentrification influences the potential moderating effects. This study uses the 2017 National Household Travel Survey subset to adults who lived in central cities n 88698. Weighted ordered logistic regression models were fit to estimate self-reported health status separately for cycling and walking. Gentrification was measured using an indicator based on previous research using US Census data. People who had cycled in the past week and each additional walking trip were associated with higher odds of reporting better health. Socioeconomic status moderated the positive associations between active transportation and health in a few key cases. Cycling was not as strongly associated with health for Black cyclists or employed cyclists while women had smaller benefits from each additional walking trip compared to men. Gentrification was an insignificant moderating factor in most cases. Findings suggest planning efforts that continue to support programs that promote cycling and walking are crucial tools in the public health toolbox. The health gains from active transportation might be experienced in a variety of neighborhood contexts. Nevertheless infrastructure investments and policy must be attentive to inequities across neighborhoods.p",

    "abstract": "Multiple competing uses of continental-shelf environments have led to a proliferation of marine spatial planning initiatives together with expert guidance on marine spatial planning. This study provides an empirical review of marine spatial plans their attributes and the extent to which the expert guidance is actually being followed. We performed a structured review of 16 existing marine spatial plans and created an idealized marine spatial plan from the steps included in recent expert papers. A cluster analysis of the yesno answers to 28 questions was used to ordinate the 16 marine spatial plans and to compare them with the idealized plan. All the plans that have been implemented have a high-level government mandate and the authority to implement spatial planning vested in existing institutions. Almost all the plans used data with clear criteria for data inclusion. Stakeholders were included in almost all the plans they did not participate in all stages of the planning process but their roles were generally clearly defined. Decision-support tools were applied inconsistently across plans and were seldom used dynamically over time. Most spatial planning processes did not select specific outcomes such as preferred use scenarios. Success is defined inconsistently across plans in half the cases there are no metrics of success with reference benchmarks. Although monitoring is included in the majority of plans only in some cases do monitoring results feed back into management decisions. The process of marine spatial planning had advanced in that some of the more recent plans were developed more quickly and contain more desirable attributes than earlier plans. Even so existing marine spatial plans are heterogeneous-there are essential ingredients but no single recipe for success. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Although a greater fraction of females maintained in all-female virgin cages survived to older ages the life expectancy of the surviving virgins was less than the life expectancy of surviving non-virgins at older ages. This was due to a mortality crossover where virgin flies experience lower mortality than mated flies from eclosion to Day 20 but higher mortality thereafter. These results suggest that there are two consequences of mating--a short-term mortality increase cost and a longer term mortality decrease benefit.",

    "abstract": "Breathing adaptation during external-beam radiotherapy is a matter of great concern because uncompensated tumour motion requires extended treatment margins that endanger sensitive tissue. Compensation strategies include beam gating collimator tracking and robotic beam re-alignment. All of these schemes have a system latency of up to several hundred milliseconds which calls in turn for predictive control loops. Irregularities in breathing make prediction difficult. We have evaluated the performance of two classes of control loop algorithms-the linear adaptive filter and the adaptive nonlinear neural network-for highly irregular patient breathing behaviours. The neural network demonstrated robust adaptability to all of the observed breathing patterns while the linear filter failed in a significant percentage of cases. For those cases where the linear filter could function it made less accurate predictions than the neural network. Because the neural network presents no additional computational burden in the control loop we conclude that it is the preferred choice among heuristic predictive algorithms.",

All complexes revealed S-ligation to the metal with an expected contraction of the sulfinyl-oxygen bond length when compared to free sulfoxide. The presented data serve to illustrate three attractive yet unexplored aspects of the bissulfoxide bidentate ligand i bidentate sulfoxide ligands when chelated to a metal give rise to complexes that are pseudo-C2 symmetric in terms of both sterics and electronics ii the sulfoxides unlike typical N- P- and O-based ligands present the coordination sphere with a significant amount of steric and electronic mismatch and iii the data support the fact that sulfoxides are moderate -donors and good-to-excellent -acceptors - an aspect that should afford such metal chelates with a wide degree of reactivity. Finally X-ray crystallographic experiments coupled with an extensive CCDC search provide an opportunity to establish the following ligand-ranking scheme for bidentate ligands spanned by an ethylene bridge R2N- RSO- RS- R2P- based on the trans influence of chloride salts of PtII. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

We hypothesized that age variably impacts mortality after burn and that age-specific models for children adults and seniors will more accurately predict mortality than an all-ages model. We audited data from the American Burn Association ABA National Burn Repository NBR from 2000 to 2009 and used mixed effect logistic regression models to assess the influence of age total body surface area TBSA burn and inhalation injury on mortality. Mortality models were constructed for all ages and age-specific models children 18 years adults 18-60 years and seniors 60 years. Model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating curve AUC. Main effect and two-way interactions were used to construct age-group specific mortality models. Each age-specific model was compared to the All Ages model. Of 286293 records 100051 had complete data. Overall mortality was 4 but varied by age 17 seniors 1 children. Age TBSA and inhalation injury were significant mortality predictors for all models p0.05. Differences in predicted mortality between the All Ages model and the age-specific models occurred in children and seniors. In the age-specific pediatric model predicted mortality decreased with age inhalation injury had greater effect on mortality than in the All Ages model. In the senior model mortality increased with age. Seniors had greater increase in mortality per 1 increment in burn size and 1 year increase in age than other ages. The predicted mortality in seniors using the senior-specific model was higher than in the All Ages model. One size fits all models for predicting burn outcomes do not accurately reflect the outcomes for seniors and children. Age-specific models for children and seniors may be advisable.",

Seven distinct repetitive DNA elements were isolated from a 75-kilobase rice bacterial artificial chromosome clone. All seven DNA elements are present in every rice centromere as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Six of the elements are middle repetitive and their copy numbers range from approximately 50 to approximately 300 in the rice genome. Five of these six middle repetitive DNA elements are present in all of the Gramineae species and the other element is detected only in species within the Bambusoideae subfamily of Gramineae. All six middle repetitive DNA elements are dispersed in the centromeric regions. The seventh element the RCS2 family is a tandem repeat of a 168-bp sequence that is represented approximately 6000 times in the rice genome and is detected only in Oryza species. Fiber-fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the RCS2 family is organized into long uninterrupted arrays and resembles previously reported tandem repeats located in the centromeres of human and Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes. We characterized a large DNA fragment derived from a plant centromere and demonstrated that rice centromeres consist of complex DNA including both highly and middle repetitive DNA sequences.",

One chromosome 11 marker RG103 detected polymorphism between the NILs that cosegregated with Xa21. All other chromosome 11 DNA markers tested were monomorphic between the NILs localizing the Xa21 introgressed region to an 8.3 cM interval on chromosome 11. Furthermore we identified two polymerase chain reaction PCR products RAPD2148 and RAPD818 that detected polymorphisms between the NILs. Genomic sequences hybridizing with RAPD818 RAPD248 and RG103 were duplicated specifically in the Xa21 NIL. All three markers cosegregated with the resistance locus Xa21 in a F2 population of 386 progeny. Based on the frequency with which we recovered polymorphic Xa21-linked markers we estimated the physical size of the introgressed region to be approximately 800 kb. This estimation was supported by physical mapping using pulsed field gel electrophoresis of the sequences hybridizing with the three Xa21-linked DNA markers. The results showed that the three Xa21-linked markers are physically close to each other with one copy of the RAPD818 sequences located within 60 kb of RAPD248 and the other copy within 270 kb of RG103. None of the enzymes tested generated a DNA fragment that hybridized with all three of the markers indicating that the introgressed region containing the resistance locus Xa21 is probably larger than 270 kb.",

    "abstract": "Myxoma virus MYXV-encoded protein M029 is a member of the poxvirus E3 family of dsRNA-binding proteins that antagonize the cellular interferon signaling pathways. In order to investigate additional functions of M029 we have constructed a series of targeted M029-minus vMyx-M029KO and vMyx-M029ID and V5-tagged M029 MYXV. We found that M029 plays a pivotal role in determining the cellular tropism of MYXV in all mammalian cells tested. The M029-minus viruses were able to replicate only in engineered cell lines that stably express a complementing protein such as vaccinia E3 but underwent abortive or abated infection in all other tested mammalian cell lines. The M029-minus viruses were dramatically attenuated in susceptible host European rabbits and caused no observable signs of myxomatosis. Using V5-tagged M029 virus we observed that M029 expressed as an early viral protein is localized in both the nuclear and cytosolic compartments in virus-infected cells and is also incorporated into virions. Using proteomic approaches we have identified Protein Kinase R PKR and RNA helicase A RHADHX9 as two cellular binding partners of M029 protein. In virus-infected cells M029 interacts with PKR in a dsRNA-dependent manner while binding with DHX9 was not dependent on dsRNA. Significantly PKR knockdown in human cells rescued the replication defect of the M029-knockout viruses. Unexpectedly this rescue of M029-minus virus replication by PKR depletion could then be reversed by RHADHX9 knockdown in human monocytic THP1 cells. This indicates that M029 not only inhibits generic PKR anti-viral pathways but also binds and conscripts RHADHX9 as a pro-viral effector to promote virus replication in THP1 cells. Thus M029 is a critical host range and virulence factor for MYXV that is required for replication in all mammalian cells by antagonizing PKR-mediated anti-viral functions and also conscripts pro-viral RHADHX9 to promote viral replication specifically in myeloid cells.",

Almost all procedures presently available in the literature are simultaneously sensitive to all three types of alternatives. The test statistics under investigation are based on functionals of the partial sums of observations. These cumulative sumtype CUSUM-type statistics have limit distributions if the mean remains constant and the errors satisfy the central limit theorem but tend to infinity in the case when any of the alternatives 1 2 or 3 holds. On removing the effect of the shifting mean however divergence of the test statistics will only occur under the random walk behavior which in turn enables statisticians not only to detect structural breaks but also to specify their causes.

We reviewed all studies involving FXS screening and cascade testing of the high-risk population in Indonesia for two decades to elucidate the prevalence as well as explore the presence of genetic clusters of FXS in Indonesia. The prevalence of FXS in the ID population of Indonesia ranged between 0.9-1.9 while in the ASD population the percentage was higher 6.15. A screening and cascade testing conducted in a small village on Java Island showed a high prevalence of 45 in the ID population suggesting a genetic cluster. The common ancestry of all affected individuals was suggestive of a founder effect in the region. Routine screening and subsequent cascade testing are essential especially in cases of ID and ASD of unknown etiology in Indonesia.",

One of the major groups of secondary metabolites in A. thaliana is the glucosinolates. These hydrophilic sulfur-rich glycosides appear to serve as defenses against some generalist herbivores and pathogens and as feeding and oviposition stimulants to specialist herbivores. To help study their biosynthesis and role in plant-insect interactions we wanted to determine the complete glucosinolate content of A. thaliana. In previous studies 24 glucosinolates had been identified from ecotype Columbia. We reinvestigated Columbia as well as additional ecotypes and mutant lines and identified 12 further glucosinolates including five novel compounds. Structures were elucidated by MS and NMR spectroscopy of their desulfated derivatives and by enzymatic cleavage of the attached ester moieties. Four of the novel glucosinolates are benzoate esters isolated from the seeds. In all but one of these compounds esterification is on the glucose moiety rather than the side chain a very unusual feature for glucosinolates. Among additional glucosinolates identified were the first non-chain elongated methionine-derived glucosinolate from A. thaliana and the first compounds that appear to be derived from leucine.",

    "abstract": "Diisocyanates commonly used in the production of polyurethane foams paints elastomers varnishes and coatings are considered among the most hazardous inhalation toxicants. The present report describes 2 unusual cases of mortality in pigeon chicks associated with nesting material contaminated by diisocyanates. Case 1 was submitted by a racing pigeon breeder who had lost all the hatchlings n 125 following replacement of the nesting material with a different lot. All adult birds appeared healthy and hatchability was not significantly affected but hatchlings became lethargic and dyspneic after a day of hatch. At necropsy dark wet lungs were found in the hatchlings. Case 2 was submitted by a show-roller pigeon breeder. In this case the owner reported lower hatchability and all hatchlings approximately 100 died within 2 days of hatching with clinical signs similar to the first case. Necropsy did not reveal any significant findings. For both cases nesting materials were screened for toxic compounds using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Toluene-24-diisocyanate approximately 190-290 ppm and 44-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate unquantified were detected in the nesting pads. While there is very limited information on toxicosis in birds there are reports of inhalant exposure of diisocyanates causing pulmonary edema and death in various mammalian species. Although cause-effect relationship of mortality and the nesting material was not established in the present cases the presence of toxic compounds in the nesting materials is a cause for concern. Further investigation is needed to determine the prevalence and toxicity of diisocyanates-contaminated nesting material in avian species.",

STUDY DESIGN Twenty-two general surgery programs provided their FE and program demographics. Three clinical education experts performed blinded assessment of FEs assessing adherence 2018 ACGME common program standards and if the FE was meaningful. RESULTS Number of questions per FE ranged from 1 to 29. The expert assessments demonstrated that no evaluation addressed all 5 ACGME standards. There were significant differences in the FEs effectiveness of assessing the 5 ACGME standards p 0.001 with teaching abilities and professionalism rated the highest and scholarly activities the lowest. CONCLUSION There was wide variation between programs regarding FEs development and adhered to ACGME standards. Faculty evaluation tools consistently built around all suggested ACGME standards may allow for a more accurate and useful assessment of faculty teaching abilities to target professional development.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Idiopathic toe walking ITW is a diagnosis of exclusion and represents a spectrum of severity. Treatment for ITW includes observation and a variety of conservative treatment methods with surgical intervention often reserved for severe cases. Previous studies reviewing treatment outcomes are often difficult to interpret secondary to a mixture of case severity. The goal of this study was to review surgical outcomes in patients with severe ITW who had failed prior conservative treatment as well as determine differences in outcomes based on the type of surgery performed. METHODS After IRB approval all patients with surgical management of severe ITW at a single institution were identified. Zone II or zone III plantar flexor lengthenings were performed in all subjects. Clinical radiographic and motion analysis data were collected preoperatively and at 1 year following surgery. RESULTS Twenty-six patients 46 extremities with a diagnosis of severe ITW from 2002 to 2017 were included. Zone II lengthenings were performed in 25 extremities mean age9.9 y and zone III lengthenings were performed in 21 extremities mean age8.6 y. At the most recent follow-up 100 of zone III lengthening extremities and 88 of zone II lengthening demonstrated decreased severity of ITW. Six extremities required additional treatment all of which were initially managed with zone II lengthenings. CONCLUSIONS Severe ITW or ITW that has not responded to conservative treatment may benefit from surgical intervention. More successful outcomes including continued resolution of toe walking were observed in subjects treated with zone III lengthenings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level III-case series.",

Naturally occurring peptides from bovine milk were sequenced and compared with human milk peptides. Bovine milk samples from six cows in second-stage peak lactation at 78-121 days postpartum revealed 159 peptides. Most peptides 73 were found in all six cows sampled demonstrating the similarity of the intramammary peptide degradation across these cows. One peptide sequence ALPIIQKLEPQIA from bovine perilipin 2 was identical to another found in human milk. Most peptides derived from -casein s1-casein and s2-casein. No peptides derived from abundant bovine milk proteins such as lactoferrin -lactoglobulin and secretory immunoglobulin A.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE On the basis of the results of the ZUMA-3 trial brexucabtagene autoleucel brexu-cel a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy gained US Food and Drug Administration approval in October 2021 for adults with relapsedrefractory RR B-cell ALL B-ALL. We report outcomes of patients treated with brexu-cel as a standard therapy. METHODS We developed a collaboration across 31 US centers to study adults with B-ALL who received brexu-cel outside the context of a clinical trial. Data were collected retrospectively from October 2021 to October 2023. Toxicities were graded per American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy guidelines for cytokine release syndrome CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome ICANS. RESULTS At the time of data lock 204 patients had undergone apheresis and 189 were infused. Median follow-up time was 11.4 months. Forty-two percent of patients received brexu-cel in morphologic remission and would have been ineligible for participation in ZUMA-3. After brexu-cel 151 achieved complete remission CR of which 79 were measurable residual disease MRD negative remissions. Median progression-free survival PFS was 9.5 months and median overall survival was not reached. Grade 3-4 CRS or ICANS occurred in 11 and 31 respectively. In multivariable analysis patients receiving consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT hazard ratio 0.34 95 CI 0.14 to 0.85 after brexu-cel had superior PFS compared with those who did not receive any consolidation or maintenance therapy. CONCLUSION Similar to ZUMA-3 high rates of MRD-negative CR were observed after brexu-cel treatment for RR B-ALL. The use of HCT as consolidation after brexu-cel resulted in improved PFS.",

OBJECTIVES Quantify the effect of sample volume 2 5 10 50 and 100 mL and time-to-analysis 0 30 and 60 minutes on RJA. ANIMALS Cannulated cow. METHODS Observational experimental study. Two liters of RJ were collected at 26 separate times. The samples were subdivided into 2 duplicates of each sample volume at each sampling time and analyzed at 0 30 and 60 minutes after collection. Rumen juice analysis included pH measurement methylene blue reduction time MBRT and protozoal motility. RESULTS The pH of 2 and 5 mL samples was significantly P .01 higher than the pH of 50 and 100 mL samples at all time points. The MBRT was significantly lower faster bacterial reduction for 100 mL samples compared to all other samples at 0 minute and to 2 5 and 50 mL samples at 30 min. The pH and MBRT at 60 minutes were significantly higher than at 0 minute for all volumes P .05 and P .01 respectively. For large protozoa small sample volumes 2 and 5 mL had significantly lower protozoal motility scores of 5 and 4.5 respectively compared to 100 mL samples at 60 minutes score of 4 P .05. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Interpretation of RJA could be affected by small sample volumes and delays to analysis. Sample volumes of 10 mL analyzed within 30 minutes after collection are recommended.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Gait classification systems GCS may enable clinicians to differentiate gait patterns into clinically significant categories that assist in clinical decision-making and assessment of outcomes. Davids and Bagley in 2014 1 described a GCS for children with cerebral palsy GCS-CP. The purpose of our study was to use the GCS-CP for the first time on a sample of patients with CP and to evaluate the reliability and utility of the classification system. METHODS The gait of 131 children with CP was retrospectively reviewed and classified according to Davids and Bagleys classification using two-dimensional 2D video and three-dimensional 3D lower limb kinematics and kinetics. Gross Motor Function Classification System GMFCS levels were determined and the Gait Profile Scores GPS calculated to characterize the sample concerning gait classification. The comparison between the groups was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with respect to the non-normal distribution of the data. The intrarater and interrater reliability was determined using the Kappa index k statistics with 95 CI. RESULTS All GCS-CP groups were represented within the evaluated sample. Of the 131 cases evaluated 127 96.95 were able to be classified with respect to sagittal plane stance phase gait deviations. All patients in the sample were able to be classified with respect to sagittal plane swing phase and transverse plane gait deviations. The interrater reliability was 0.596 and 0.485 for the first and second levels of the classification respectively according to the Fleisss Kappa statistics. Intrarater reliability was 0.776 and 0.714 for the raters one and two respectively according to the Cohens Kappa statistics. SIGNIFICANCE The GCS-CP exhibited clinical utility successfully classifying almost all subjects with CP in two planes based upon kinematic and kinetic data. The classification is valid and has moderate interrater and moderate to substantial intrarater reliability.",

Our results demonstrated a statistically significant P0.05 increase of ZnT1 ZnT3 ZnT4 ZnT6 and ZnT7 in both hippocampus and neo-cortex using Western blot method and an abundant distribution of zinc ions in the plaques and amyloid angiopathic vessels using immersion autometallography. Furthermore all ZnT immunoreactions were detected in most amyloid plaques and amyloid angiopathic vessels. ZnT1 and ZnT4 were extensively expressed in all parts of the plaques. ZnT3 ZnT5 and ZnT6 were expressed most prominently in the degenerating neurites in the peripheral part of the plaques while ZnT7 was present in the core of the plaques. The amyloid angiopathic vessels showed a strong ZnT3 immunoreactivity. These results might suggest multiple roles of ZnTs in the deposition and organization of the Abeta composition.",

All of them responded to increased immunosuppression e.g. steroid bolus antithymocyte globulin and retained normal graft function. Because the clinical manifestations are non-specific vigilance is necessary to make an accurate diagnosis.

    "abstract": "The receiver operating characteristic ROC curve has become a common tool for evaluating diagnostic imaging technologies and the primary endpoint of such evaluations is the area under the curve AUC which integrates sensitivity over the entire false positive range. An alternative figure of merit for ROC studies is expected utility EU which focuses on the relevant region of the ROC curve as defined by disease prevalence and the relative utility of the task. However if this measure is to be used it must also have desirable statistical properties keep the burden of observer performance studies as low as possible. Here we evaluate effect size and variability for EU and AUC. We use two observer performance studies recently submitted to the FDA to compare the EU and AUC endpoints. The studies were conducted using the multi-reader multi-case methodology in which all readers score all cases in all modalities. ROC curves from the study were used to generate both the AUC and EU values for each reader and modality. The EU measure was computed assuming an iso-utility slope of 1.03. We find mean effect sizes the reader averaged difference between modalities to be roughly 2.0 times as big for EU as AUC. The standard deviation across readers is roughly 1.4 times as large suggesting better statistical properties for the EU endpoint. In a simple power analysis of paired comparison across readers the utility measure required 36 fewer readers on average to achieve 80 statistical power compared to AUC. 2013 SPIE.",

Using selected initial pattern ensembles state space structures in this high-dimensional nonlinear spatial system can be identified via the resulting decay to its attractors. Considered over a range of lattice sizes the decay behavior falls into three main classes each of which shows a characteristic profile. The first consists of even-size lattices showing a decelerating decay to small nonattracted ensemble fractions. The second class also for even lattices is a catastrophic decay to very small or vanishing nonattracted fractions. The third class also shows catastrophic decay and contains all odd-size lattices. Stochastic models are constructed that mimic the behavior of typical lattices throughout their evolution until finite-size effects appear. Weak additive noise causes all states on all lattices to fall into the attractor. In the end we find it overwhelmingly likely that the recently proposed attractor-basin portrait captures the CAs qualitative dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Methoxypyrazines are volatile compounds found in plants microbes and insects that have potent vegetal and earthy aromas. With sensory detection thresholds in the low ng L-1 range modest concentrations of these compounds can profoundly impact the aroma quality of foods and beverages and high levels can lead to consumer rejection. The wine industry routinely analyzes the most prevalent methoxypyrazine 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine IBMP to aid in harvest decisions since concentrations decrease during berry ripening. In addition to IBMP three other methoxypyrazines IPMP 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine SBMP 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and EMP 2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine have been identified in grapes andor wine and can impact aroma quality. Despite their routine analysis in the wine industry mostly IBMP accurate methoxypyrazine quantitation is hindered by two major challenges sensitivity and resolution. With extremely low sensory detection thresholds 8-15 ng L-1 in wine for IBMP highly sensitive analytical methods to quantify methoxypyrazines at trace levels are necessary. Here we were able to achieve resolution of IBMP as well as IPMP EMP and SBMP from co-eluting compounds using one-dimensional chromatography coupled to positive chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Three extraction techniques HS-SPME headspace-solid phase microextraction SBSE stirbar sorptive extraction and HSSE headspace sorptive extraction were validated and compared. A 30 min extraction time was used for HS-SPME and SBSE extraction techniques while 120 min was necessary to achieve sufficient sensitivity for HSSE extractions. All extraction methods have limits of quantitation LOQ at or below 1 ng L-1 for all four methoxypyrazines analyzed i.e. LOQs at or below reported sensory detection limits in wine. The method is high throughput with resolution of all compounds possible with a relatively rapid 27 min GC oven program.",

Our laboratory has demonstrated that tail-tip fibroblasts reprogrammed into iPSCs via two adenoviruses can survive and differentiate into neuronal lineages following transplantation into healthy adult rats. However the ability of these cells to survive differentiate and restore function in a damaged brain is unknown. To this end adult rats received a regimen of 3-nitropropionic acid 3-NP to induce behavioral and neuropathological deficits that resemble HD. At 7 21 and 42 days after the initiation of 3-NP or vehicle the rats received intrastriatal bilateral transplantation of iPSCs. All rats that received 3-NP and vehicle treatment displayed significant motor impairment whereas those that received iPSC transplantation after 3-NP treatment had preserved motor function. Histological analysis of the brains of these rats revealed significant decreases in optical densitometric measures in the striatum lateral ventricle enlargement as well as an increase in striosome size in all rats receiving 3-NP when compared with sham rats. The 3-NP-treated rats given transplants of iPSCs in the 7- or 21-day groups did not exhibit these deficits. Transplantation of iPSCs at the late-stage 42-day time point did not protect against the 3-NP-induced neuropathology despite preserving motor function. Transplanted iPSCs were found to survive and differentiate into region-specific neurons in the striatum of 3-NP rats at all transplantation time points. Taken together these results suggest that transplantation of adenovirus-generated iPSCs may provide a potential avenue for therapeutic treatment of HD.",

Individual rates of change showed considerable heterogeneity in each domain. Baseline clinical diagnosis predicted differential change in semantic memory and executive function dementia mild cognitive impairment MCI normal but average decline in verbal episodic memory was similar across all 3 diagnostic groups. There was substantial overlap of distributions of cognitive change across baseline diagnostic groups for all 3 measures. Cognitive change was strongly related to change in clinical diagnosis. Rapid and similar change was present for all 3 cognitive measures in patients with dementia and in those with normal cognition and those with MCI who progressed clinically. In cognitively normal patients verbal episodic memory change was greater than change in the other two domains. Global status measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale Morris 1993 predicted change in semantic memory and executive function whereas APOE genotype predicted change in verbal episodic memory and age had no effect on rates of change in any domain independent of global status and APOE. Results show important limitations in using cross-sectional diagnosis to predict prognosis and suggest that research to identify robust predictors of cognitive change across the full spectrum from normal to dementia is needed for better early identification of diseases that cause progressive decline.",

In this study Pediatric Oncology Group Protocol 8303 two methods were examined for improving the outcome in these children. METHODS After remission induction with prednisone vincristine daunorubicin and asparaginase PVDA and consolidation chemotherapy with teniposide and cytarabine patients received weekly continuation chemotherapy with rotating pairs of drugs comprised of teniposide and cytarabine and vincristine and cyclophosphamide. In addition they were randomized to receive or not receive repeated reinduction with PVDA. Patients with matched sibling donors were allowed to receive allogeneic bone marrow transplantation BMT instead of continued chemotherapy. RESULTS Of 297 evaluable patients 258 87 achieved second complete hematologic remission. However only 23 of these patients remained continuously free of leukemia or 7 years after chemotherapy or BMT. Neither PVDA pulses nor BMT appeared to influence outcome at a statistically significant level. CONCLUSIONS The results of the current study confirm prior reports of the low cure rate of children with ALL who experience hematologic recurrence during initial therapy or shortly after its cessation. New approaches are needed to prevent and retreat hematologic recurrence in pediatric ALL patients.",

The database will be searchable and cross-indexed with relevant publications including published detector descriptions. It should eventually contain all published data from older heavy-ion programs such as the Bevalac AGS SPS and FNAL fixed-target programs as well as published data from current programs at RHIC and new facilities at GSI FAIR KEKTsukuba and the LHC collider. This data includes all proton-proton proton-nucleus to nucleus-nucleus collisions as well as other relevant systems and all measured observables. Such a database would have tremendous scientific payoff as it makes systematic studies easier and allows simpler benchmarking of theoretical models to a broad range of experiments. To enhance the utility of the database we propose periodic data evaluations and topical reviews. These reviews would provide an alternative and impartial mechanism to resolve discrepancies between published data from rival experiments and between theory and experiment. Since this database will be a community resource it requires the high-energy nuclear physics communitys financial and manpower support. jatsp",

    "abstract": "In recent years the field has reached an impasse between models suggesting that the hippocampus is fundamentally involved in spatial processing and models suggesting that the hippocampus automatically encodes all dimensions of experience in the service of memory. Here we consider key conceptual issues that have impeded progress in our understanding of hippocampal function and we review findings that establish the scope and limits of hippocampal involvement in navigation and memory. We argue that space and time serve as a primary scaffold to break up experiences into specific contexts and to organize multimodal input that is to be associated within a context. However the hippocampus is clearly capable of incorporating additional dimensions into the scaffold if they are determined to be relevant in the event-defined context. Conceiving of the hippocampal representation as constrained by immediate task demands-yet preferring axes that involve space and time-helps to reconcile an otherwise disparate set of findings on the core function of the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Laparoscopic approaches are possible for many pediatric surgical diseases including complex biliary disorders. The authors describe their early experience with laparoscopic procedures for biliary atresia and choledochal cysts. METHODS A retrospective review was performed with Institutional Review Board IRB approval of children undergoing laparoscopic Kasai portoenterostomy n 2 or laparoscopic excision of a choledochal cyst with Roux-en-y biliary reconstruction n 3. The authors report the operative technique for these procedures and present their initial results. RESULTS All procedures were performed with 4 to 5 trocars using 3- and 5-mm ports. Excision of the fibrous biliary remnant biliary atresia or of the cyst choledochal cysts was performed laparoscopically in all cases. The Roux-en-y limb was created through a 1-cm extension of the umbilical port site. Laparoscopic biliary reconstruction was performed successfully in 4 of 5 patients. In one child the proximal extent of the choledochal cyst was at the bifurcation of the hepatic duct and the biliary reconstruction was performed via an open incision with separate anastomoses of the right and left ducts. The gallbladder was used as a handle for retraction of the liver for portal visualization as in a cholecystectomy and was resected at the end of the procedure. All children with choledochal cysts have normal bilirubin values. One of 2 children who underwent laparoscopic Kasai has a normal postoperative bilirubin level whereas the other child did not drain bile and underwent a successful liver transplantation. Mean length of surgery was 338 minutes mean length of stay was 5.5 days. There were no significant postoperative complications. Cosmesis was excellent in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic approaches for children with biliary atresia and choledochal cysts are possible. Excellent visualization of the portal structures can be achieved laparoscopically with adequate retraction of the liver. Further follow-up is needed to determine broader application.",

Results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios HR and 95 confidence intervals CI.jatsp jatspResultsjatsp jatspAmong 37282 patients included in this analysis 6213 had AML 3730 had ALL and 27339 had NHL. The 3- and 12-month cumulative incidence of UE DVT was 2.6 and 3.6 for AML 2.1 and 3 for ALL and 1.0 and 1.6 for NHL respectively Figure 1A. Most 56-64 incident UE DVT events occurred within the first 3 months of malignancy diagnosis. African Americans HR 1.66 CI 1.22-2.28 and Hispanics HR 1.35 CI 1.10-1.66 with NHL had an increased risk of incident UE DVT compared to non-Hispanics Whites. NHL patients with a CVC had over a 2-fold increased risk of incident UE DVT HR 2.05 CI 1.68-2.51 compared to those without a CVC.jatsp jatspUE DVT was a risk factor for development of PE or LE DVT in ALL HR 2.53 CI 1.29-4.95 and NHL HR 1.63 CI 1.11-2.39 but not in AML. The 12-month cumulative incidence of subsequent VTE after an incident UE DVT diagnosis was 6.4 for AML 12.0 for ALL and 7.6 for NHL. 46-58 of subsequent VTEs occurred within the first 3 months of incident UE DVT diagnosis. The majority of subsequent VTEs were UE DVT which had a 12-month cumulative incidence of 4.6 for AML 6.6 for ALL and 4.0 for NHL Figure 1B. The 12-month cumulative incidence of subsequent LE DVT was 1.3 for AML 1.6 for ALL and 1.9 for NHL Figure 1C. The 12-month cumulative incidence of subsequent PE was 0.4 for AML 4.1 for ALL and 1.8 for NHL Figure 1D.jatsp jatspThe 12-month cumulative incidence of major bleeding after an UE DVT diagnosis was 29 for AML 29 for ALL and 20 for NHL. Common major bleeding events included gastrointestinal GI bleeds epistaxis and intracranial hemorrhage. GI bleeding was the most common major bleeding event among all three malignancies 14.2 in AML 9.6 in ALL and 12.4 in NHL. The rate of intracranial hemorrhage was 6 in AML 3.5 in ALL and 1.7 in NHL. A diagnosis of incident UE DVT was associated with an increased risk of cancer-specific mortality in all three malignancies HR 1.38 CI 1.16-1.65 in AML HR 2.16 CI 1.66-2.82 in ALL HR 2.38 CI 2.06-2.75 in NHL.jatsp jatspConclusionsjatsp jatspUE DVT is an important complication among patients with AML ALL and NHL with the majority of UE DVT events occurring within the first 3 months of diagnosis. The most common VTE event after an index UE DVT was another UE DVT although patients also had subsequent PE and LE DVT. UE DVT was a risk factor for development of PE or LE DVT in ALL and NHL but not in AML. Major bleeding after an UE DVT was high in all three malignancies ampgt20 with GI bleeds being the most common. UE DVT in patients with AML ALL and NHL is associated with increased risk of mortality.jatsp jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspWun Janssen Other Steering committee Pfizer Other Steering committee.jatsp jatssec",

We present the complete genome sequences of these organisms along with comparisons to other organisms in the Rickettsiales order. Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. display a unique large expansion of immunodominant outer membrane proteins facilitating antigenic variation. All Rickettsiales have a diminished ability to synthesize amino acids compared to their closest free-living relatives. Unlike members of the Rickettsiaceae family these pathogenic Anaplasmataceae are capable of making all major vitamins cofactors and nucleotides which could confer a beneficial role in the invertebrate vector or the vertebrate host. Further analysis identified proteins potentially involved in vacuole confinement of the Anaplasmataceae a life cycle involving a hematophagous vector vertebrate pathogenesis human pathogenesis and lack of transovarial transmission. These discoveries provide significant insights into the biology of these obligate intracellular pathogens.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Left atrial appendage occlusion LAAO devices have become a favorable alternative option among nonvalvular atrial fibrillation AF patients with long-term contraindication to anticoagulation. Real-world experience with postprocedural readmission rates and predictors of readmission in LAAO patients is limited. OBJECTIVE To assess all-cause 30-day readmission rate and predictors of readmission after LAAO procedure in the United States. METHOD This retrospective observational study included all AF patients undergoing percutaneous LAAO procedures in the United States from January 1 2016 and December 31 2017 in the National Readmission Database. The primary outcome measure was all-cause 30-day readmission. A propensity score-matched analysis compared outcomes with a non-LAAO AF cohort. RESULT Among 14 024 LAAO procedures age 76 8 years 60.5 males 9.4 were readmitted within 30-days and 0.2 died during their index hospitalization. The most frequent primary diagnosis during readmission among LAAO was gastrointestinal bleeding 12. The incidence of LAAO procedures increased by 102. In the multivariate model gender and CHA2 DS2 -VASc failed to predict readmission. Age 55-64 years had lower odds adjusted odds ratios aOR 0.41 95 confidence interval CI 0.18-0.94 while drug abuse aOR 4.1 95 CI 1.34-12.54 and deficiency anemia aOR 1.88 95 CI 1.12-3.18 had higher odds of readmission. In propensity-matched cohort compared to non-LAAO AF LAAO patients had lower 30-day readmission 9.4 vs. 10.98 p .002 and all-cause in-hospital mortality 0.19 vs. 0.57 p .001. CONCLUSION The readmission rate following the LAAO procedure is substantial approximately 10 and largely attributable to gastrointestinal bleeding. Factors such as drug abuse and anemia must be explored further to minimize readmission risk.",

    "abstract": "Carrying capacity models for wintering waterfowl require estimates of energy availability based on food densities and true metabolizable energy TME of various food types. However because TME values vary widely between studies estimates of carrying capacity may be less precise than previously acknowledged. We explored how variation in TME values affected estimates of landscape-level energy availability for American black ducks Anas rubripes using 4 distinct approaches for assigning TME values to waterfowl food items collected over the winter period in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 a best practices approach which typically used average TMEs across species a minimum and maximum reported values approaches and a coarse-scale order-average approach. We found that all 4 approaches yielded significantly different estimates of energy availability across all saltmarsh habitat types. Additionally we evaluated the potential management implications of variation in TME values by comparing energy supply on 1223 ha of marsh in Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge DE USA using all 4 approaches for assigning TME values. We estimated carrying capacity and modeled depletion of energy on this refuge over a hypothetical wintering period. We found that even relatively small variations in TME values produced highly variable estimates of carrying capacity for the refuge. Thus we recommend that researchers consider the inherent uncertainty in TME values of waterfowl foods and explicitly include this variation in carrying capacity models.",

Cox proportional hazard models were used for the comparison from which hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals were computed. Within each racialethnic subgroup women with diabetes had an approximately 2-3 times higher risk of all-cause cardiovascular and cancer mortality than did those without diabetes.

    "abstract": "This work evaluated a commercial fallback planning workflow designed to provide cross-platform treatment planning and delivery. A total of 27 helical tomotherapy intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans covering 4 anatomical sites were selected including 7 brain 5 unilateral head and neck 5 bilateral head and neck 5 pelvis and 5 prostate cases. All helical tomotherapy plans were converted to 7-field9-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated radiotherapy plans through fallback dose-mimicking algorithm using a 6-MV beam model. The planning target volume PTV coverage D1 D99 and homogeneity index and organs at risk dose constraints were evaluated and compared. Overall all 3 techniques resulted in relatively inferior target dose coverage compared to helical tomotherapy plans with higher homogeneity index and maximum dose. The organs at risk dose ratio of fallback to helical tomotherapy plans covered a wide spectrum from 0.87 to 1.11 on average for all sites with fallback plans being superior for brain pelvis and prostate sites. The quality of fallback plans depends on the delivery technique field numbers and angles as well as user selection of structures for organs at risk. In actual clinical scenario fallback plans would typically be needed for 1 to 5 fractions of a treatment course in the event of machine breakdown. Our results suggested that 1 dose variance can be introduced in target coverage andor organs at risk from fallback plans. The presented clinical workflow showed that the fallback plan generation typically takes 10 to 20 minutes per case. Fallback planning provides an expeditious and effective strategy for transferring patients cross platforms and minimizing the untold risk of a patient missing treatments.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Smoking is an established risk factor in many pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The Best Endovascular vs Best Surgical Therapy in Patients with Critical Limb Ischemia BEST-CLI trial affords an in-depth evaluation into the effect of smoking on patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia CLTI. BEST-CLIs prospective randomized design evaluated outcomes in patients suitable for both open or endovascular intervention and randomized patients between endovascular intervention ENDO vs open surgical bypass OPEN. The outcomes are reported stratified by smoking status. METHODS In the BEST-CLI trial patients were stratified by current smokers CS and nonsmokers NS which included both previous smokers or never smokers. Endpoints at 4 years include the primary trial outcomes major adverse limb events MALE or all-cause death as well as above-ankle amputation all-cause death major or minor reintervention major adverse cardiac events MACE MALE and MALE or perioperative death. Multivariable Cox regression models were created with NS serving as the reference group. RESULTS Patients received bypass using single-segment saphenous vein n 621 bypass using alternative conduits n 236 or endovascular procedures n 923. There were 641 CSs and 1137 NSs. In the combined cohort of patients receiving ENDO or OPEN CS status was associated with a higher rate of MALE hazard ratio HR 1.27 95 confidence interval CI 1.05-1.55 P .02 but a lower rate of all-cause death HR 0.80 95 CI 0.66-0.97 P .02 when compared with NS status. In the OPEN group CSs had a lower rate of all-cause death HR 0.74 95 CI 0.56-0.98 P .04 than NSs and no significant difference in MALE HR 1.18 95 CI 0.85-1.63 P .34. In the ENDO group CSs had a higher rate of above-ankle amputation HR 1.51 95 CI 1.04-2.19 P .03 and MALE HR 1.33 95 CI 1.04-1.69 P .02. Additionally on subset analysis of the entire cohort it was found that when comparing prior smokers to never-smokers there was a 24 increase in reintervention P .05 and when comparing CSs to never smokers there was a 27 increase in reintervention P .04. CONCLUSIONS CSs had worse limb outcomes in the BEST-CLI trial. CSs undergoing endovascular revascularization had higher rates of MALE and above-ankle amputations following adjustment. Current smoking did not impact MALE in patients with CLTI undergoing open surgical bypass.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Older patients may regard some medications particularly psychotropic medications as discretionary compared with what they perceive as more essential nonpsychiatric medications. Patients concerns about psychotropic medication costs under Medicare Part D may reinforce these impressions. DESIGN The authors examined which Medicare prescription drug plans PDPs would be least expensive for beneficiaries considering the costs of 1 all medications and 2 only nonpsychiatric medications. SETTING The authors collected data from the PDP online comparison tool provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS. PARTICIPANTS Hypothetical Medicare beneficiaries. MEASUREMENTS The authors examined four clinical scenarios from older outpatients with both chronic medical and psychiatric conditions including psychosis bipolar disorder depression and dementia with behavioral disturbances. RESULTS The authors examined data from all 160 plans available in CMS PDP regions in May 2007. There were frequent discrepancies in the least expensive PDPs within region depending on considering the costs of all medications or just nonpsychiatric medications. In the clinical scenarios patients selecting a PDP based on nonpsychiatric medications alone would pick an unnecessarily more expensive plan 74-100 of the time when they took any brand name medication suggesting that excluding psychiatric medications from PDP choices may be excessively costly. However brand name psychotropic medications significantly increased the costs of the least expensive plans. The latter finding might persuade patients to avoid taking needed psychiatric medication due to cost. CONCLUSION This research highlights the complexity that patients with psychiatric and cognitive disorders face when choosing a Medicare PDP. Policymakers and clinicians should be aware of the tradeoffs that beneficiaries with psychiatric disorders face when making PDP plan choices.",

    "abstract": "There are two unresolved puzzles in the literature examining how people evaluate mates i.e. prospective or current romanticsexual partners. First compatibility is theoretically crucial but attempts to explain why certain perceivers are compatible with certain targets have revealed small effects. Second features of partners e.g. personality consensually rated attributes affect perceivers evaluations strongly in initial-attraction contexts but weakly in established relationships. Mate Evaluation Theory MET addresses these puzzles beginning with the Social Relations Model postulate that all evaluative constructs e.g. attraction relationship satisfaction consist of target perceiver and relationship variance. MET then explains how people draw evaluations from mates attributes using four information sources a shared evolved mechanisms and cultural scripts common lens which produces target variance b individual differences that affect how a perceiver views all targets perceiver lens which produces perceiver variance c individual differences that affect how a perceiver views some targets depending on the targets features feature lens which produces some relationship variance and d narratives about and idiosyncratic reactions to one particular target target-specific lens which produces most relationship variance. These two distinct sources of relationship variance i.e. feature vs. target-specific address Puzzle 1 Previous attempts to explain compatibility used feature lens information but relationship variance likely derives primarily from the understudied target-specific lens. MET also addresses Puzzle 2 by suggesting that repeated interaction causes the target-specific lens to expand which reduces perceivers use of the common lens. We conclude with new predictions and implications at the intersection of the human-mating and person-perception literatures. PsycInfo Database Record c 2023 APA all rights reserved.",

This ELISA was tolerant to solvents salts and pH changes and functioned well in a series of matrices water soil horse manure urine and fungal extracts. In preliminary bioremediation studies conducted in a drum impervious to UV light the microbes endogenous to horse manure converted approximately 1 of the total initial amount of atrazine to hydroxyatrazine. Also a UV-resistant strain of white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was tested for its ability to degrade atrazine. Using the ELISA described here approximately half of the time zero amount of atrazine 2 jug35-mm Petri dish was gone in 1 day and essentially all of the atrazine was converted to hydroxyatrazine primarily due to UV irradiation. This ELISA provided a valuable method to quantify hydroxyatrazine and hydroxysimazine in a series of traditionally difficult matrices for the investigation of the bioremediation of atrazine. 1993 American Chemical Society.

    "abstract": "Botryosphaeria branch canker and dieback of avocado Persea americana Mill. has expanded in avocado-growing areas in recent years. Twenty-one avocado groves in the major producing regions of California were surveyed in 2018 and 2019. Monthly inoculations of wounded green and lignified branches of Hass and Lamb Hass were conducted. Botryosphaeriaceae were the predominant fungi recovered from cankered tissues collected across the surveyed traditional and high-density orchards and caused symptoms on all six sampled cultivars. These fungi were also recovered in asymptomatic twigs and other organs and thus exist as a potential reservoir for future infections. Molecular analyses of 173 isolates showed that Neofusicoccum luteum had the greatest incidences across sites and cultivars with 83 and 29 recovered from Hass and Lamb Hass respectively. Pathogenicity tests on excised Hass GEM and Hass mutants and attached shoots from potted Hass and mature avocado trees Hass and Lamb Hass showed that all species were pathogenic on wounded green and mature branches of the specified cultivars. Monthly inoculations of wounded green and lignified branches of Hass and Lamb Hass showed that both stem types were susceptible throughout the inoculation periods regardless of the avocado phenological stage. In temperature-dependent growth and infection studies growth of three points could vary during the growing season. Botryosphaeriaceae grown was higher between 20 and 30C but only Lasiodiplodia theobromae significantly grew and caused external lesions at 35C. Lasiodiplodia theobromae also grew more on perseitol-amended media all indicating its adaptation to warmer temperatures and capacity in metabolizing the avocado-produced sugar. Overall this study extended our knowledge of the prevalence identity and pathogenicity of Botryosphaeriaceae on avocado cultivars which will be useful to tailor management strategies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recent anatomic studies have failed to demonstrate a single utilitarian approach to intraoperative identification and surgical release of all 5 potential sites of posterior interosseous nerve PIN compression in the radial tunnel. This study examines if a single incision brachioradialis-splitting approach without the use of additional anatomic windows is capable of adequately exposing the entire length of the radial tunnel including all 5 sites of PIN compression to allow for adequate release. METHODS Ten fresh frozen cadaver forearms 6 female 4 male were dissected utilizing a curvilinear 7 cm incision over the brachioradialis. The muscle belly was split via simple blunt retraction exposing the radial tunnel. The PIN was identified and mobilized at 5 compression sites radiocapitellar joint RCJ radial recurrent vessels Leash of Henry fibrous medioproximal edge of extensor carpe radialis brevis arcade of Frohse and distal edge of supinator. RESULTS The PIN was identified and effectively released in all specimens without difficulty from this single approach. All 5 sites of compression were visible and accessible through the brachioradialis-split approach. Specifically there was no difficulty in identifying and releasing the PIN at the distal edge of supinator. CONCLUSIONS Radial tunnel syndrome is defined as PIN compression within the radial tunnel spanning from the fibrous RCJ to the distal edge of the supinator. A single brachioradialis-splitting approach is adequate for complete visualization and release of all compression sites of the radial tunnel. Utilizing this technique allows for surgical access and ease as well as minimizing necessity for additional windows or multiple incisions.",

PROCEDURE The CD phenotype was determined by videofluoroscopy and dogs were classified as affected if the upper esophageal sphincter UES did not open if there were morphologic abnormalities of the UES or if opening of the UES was delayed for or 6 videofluoroscopic frames 0.2 seconds after closure of the epiglottis. All survey radiographic and videofluoroscopic studies were reviewed by the same radiologist. RESULTS Of the 117 dogs 47 males and 70 females with a CD phenotype determined via videofluoroscopy 21 dogs 18.0 had abnormalities of the UES affected. Of these 21 dogs 9 were males 19.1 of all males and 12 were females 17.1 of all females. The heritability of CD in a threshold model was estimated as 0.61 which established that CD could be passed from parent to offspring. Results of complex segregation analysis suggested that a single recessive allele of large effect contributed to the expression of this disease in Golden Retrievers. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The determination that CD is inherited in Golden Retrievers is an important step in providing information for veterinarians attending dogs with this disorder.

Our goal is to understand neurobehavioral principles in a mammalian model organism-the Norway rat pup Rattus norvegicus. Our approach is unique in that animal simulation and robot studies occur in parallel and inform each other. Behavior is dependent on the nervous system body morphology physiology environment and the interactions among these elements. Autonomous robotics hardware models and their associated simulations allow the possibility of systematically manipulating variables in each of these elements in ways that would be impossible using live animals. Specifically we describe the development and validation of a Newtonian-dynamics-based simulation of a robotic rat pup including mathematical formulation and computer implementation. The computer simulation consists of three distinct components that interact to simulate robotic behavior 1 dynamics of the robotic rat pup itself including sensors and actuators 2 environmental coupling dynamics of the robot arena with the robotic rat pup and 3 the robot control algorithms as implemented on the physical robot. The mathematical formulation software implementation model identification model validation and an application example are all described. 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "The sagittal bands are a component of the extensor hood. They serve an important role in stabilizing the extensor tendon by forming a check-rein to radial-ulnar translation of the tendon over the metacarpal head and extending the metacarpophalangeal MCP joint by virtue of attaching the extensor tendon to the palmar plate. Injury to the sagittal band is thought to cause extensor instability and subluxation to the contralateral side by disruption of this check-rein function although recent evidence from cadaver studies suggests that ulnar sagittal band tear may be spared of extensor instability. As a case in point we encountered a patient with surgically proven ulnar sagittal band tear who did not have any extensor tendon subluxation or any limitation in motion. Intraoperative findings demonstrated a chronic-appearing ulnar sagittal band tear indicating that chronic injury with fibrosis may stabilize the central band. Therefore in patients with metacarpophalangeal pain without central tendon subluxation or limitation of motion it remains important to raise the concern of sagittal band tear for appropriate treatment. We present the clinical course of this case with radiological and operative findings followed by a review of the relevant literature.",

Initiatives have focused on increasing accrual but changes at the population-level are unknown. We examined patterns of clinical trial participation over time in AYA cancer patients. Methods We utilized medical record data from AYAs in two National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Studies identified through the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER Program. Among 1358 AYAs diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL Hodgkin lymphoma HL acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL germ cell cancer and sarcoma in 2006 and 3560 AYAs diagnosed with NHL HL ALL sarcoma and breast cancer in 20122013 we used unconditional logistic regression to evaluate patient and provider characteristics associated with enrollment by year of diagnosis. Analyses were weighted to reflect the SEER populations and associations are summarized as adjusted odds ratios OR with 95 confidence intervals CI. Results From 2006 to 20122013 clinical trial participation increased from 14.8 to 17.9 among AYAs diagnosed with NHL HL ALL and sarcoma p lt 0.0001 primarily due to increased participation among ALL patients 2006 37.4 20122013 42.3. In 20122013 participation varied by type of cancer with the highest among those with ALL and sarcoma 31.2 followed by HL 9.4 NHL 6.9 and breast cancer 4.3. In both study years multivariate analyses demonstrated that younger patients and those treated by pediatric oncologists OR 3.5 CI 2.6-4.7 were more likely to enroll onto clinical trials. Uninsured AYAs were less likely to enroll in 2006 but no association was observed in 20122013. Hispanic OR 0.5 CI 0.4-0.6 Black OR 0.6 CI 0.5-0.9 and Asian OR 0.4 CI 0.3-0.6 AYAs were less likely to enroll in 20122013 but not 2006. Conclusions Our study identified increasing overall clinical trial participation over time. Disparities in likelihood of participating for racialethnic minority groups increased suggesting the need to improve access to clinical trials for all racialethnic groups to improve care and outcomes. jatsp",

    "abstract": "Understanding the processes by which species colonize and adapt to human habitats is particularly important in the case of disease-vectoring arthropods. The mosquito species Aedes aegypti a major vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses probably originated as a wild zoophilic species in sub-Saharan Africa where some populations still breed in tree holes in forested habitats. Many populations of the species however have evolved to thrive in human habitats and to bite humans. This includes some populations within Africa as well as almost all those outside Africa. It is not clear whether all domestic populations are genetically related and represent a single domestication event or whether association with human habitats has developed multiple times independently within the species. To test the hypotheses above we screened 24 worldwide population samples of Ae. aegypti at 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. We identified two distinct genetic clusters one included all domestic populations outside of Africa and the other included both domestic and forest populations within Africa. This suggests that human association in Africa occurred independently from that in domestic populations across the rest of the world. Additionally measures of genetic diversity support Ae. aegypti in Africa as the ancestral form of the species. Individuals from domestic populations outside Africa can reliably be assigned back to their population of origin which will help determine the origins of new introductions of Ae. aegypti.",

    "abstract": "Precision drug delivery has a great impact on the application of precision oncology for better patient care. Here we report a facile strategy for fine-tuning the stability drug release and responsiveness of stimuli-responsive cross-linked nanoparticles towards precision drug delivery. A series of micellar nanoparticles with different levels of intramicellar disulfide crosslinkages could be conveniently produced with a mixed micelle approach. These micellar nanoparticles were all within a size range of 25-40 nm so that they could take full advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention EPR effect for tumor-targeted drug delivery. The properties of these nanoparticles such as critical micelle concentration CMC stability drug release and responsiveness to a reductive environment could be well correlated with the levels of crosslinking LOC. Compared to the micellar nanoparticles with a LOC at 0 that caused the death of animals of two species mouse and rat due to the acute toxicity such as hemolysis the nanoparticles at all other levels of crosslinking were much safer to be administered into animals. The in vitro antitumor efficacy of micellar nanoparticles crosslinked at lower levels 20 50 were much more effective than that of 100 crosslinked micellar nanoparticles in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "We develop Categorical Exploratory Data Analysis CEDA with mimicking to explore and exhibit the complexity of information content that is contained within any data matrix categorical discrete or continuous. Such complexity is shown through visible and explainable serial multiscale structural dependency with heterogeneity. CEDA is developed upon all features categorical nature via histogram and it is guided by all features associative patterns order-2 dependence in a mutual conditional entropy matrix. Higher-order structural dependency of k3 features is exhibited through block patterns within heatmaps that are constructed by permuting contingency-kD-lattices of counts. By growing k the resultant heatmap series contains global and large scales of structural dependency that constitute the data matrixs information content. When involving continuous features the principal component analysis PCA extracts fine-scale information content from each block in the final heatmap. Our mimicking protocol coherently simulates this heatmap series by preserving global-to-fine scales structural dependency. Upon every step of mimicking process each accepted simulated heatmap is subject to constraints with respect to all of the reliable observed categorical patterns. For reliability and robustness in sciences CEDA with mimicking enhances data visualization by revealing deterministic and stochastic structures within each scale-specific structural dependency. For inferences in Machine Learning ML and Statistics it clarifies upon which scales which covariate feature-groups have major-vs.-minor predictive powers on response features.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This investigation sought to systematically identify and characterize a cohort of patients treated in hospice for life-limiting injuries sustained in a suicide attempt that was not immediately lethal. METHOD We developed a case series of all completed suicides in a large community-based hospice from 2004 through 2010. Clinical documentation and county medical examiner reports were used to identify those deaths that resulted from a suicide attempt made prior to hospice admission. Cases were characterized in terms of basic demographic variables the temporal sequence of events in the transition from hospital care to hospice the mechanism of injury and medical complications the presence of mental illness and family involvement in decision making. RESULTS Out of a total of 20887 hospice deaths during the study period 8 deaths resulted from an incomplete suicide attempt made prior to hospice admission. Subjects were nearly all male 68 and 46 years old on average substantially younger than the general hospice population. Drug overdose was the most common method of suicide 58 and irreversible anoxic brain injury was the main medical complication. The majority of subjects 68 had evidence of serious mental illness. Most cases were complicated by estranged family relationships however family members were involved in end-of-life decision making for nearly all patients. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS Whereas a failed suicide attempt leading to hospice appears to be a relatively rare event patients in this population appear unique in several regards. Further study may serve to better characterize this group and prepare hospice agencies and clinicians for caring for this unique population.",

The method allows the simultaneous estimation of the relative times of divergence of all common ancestors while utilizing the information from all four proteins. It also affords the possibility of statistically testing several biologically meaningful hypotheses. The results are the following 1. The total rate sum of all proteins of nucleotide substitution is not constant in time throughout the evolution of vertebrates. 2. The relative rates among proteins of nucleotide substitution are not constant throughout vertebrate evolution. 3. Despite the variation in the rates of nucleotide substitution the procedure employed provides estimates of the relative time of divergence which correlate well with paleontological dates. 4. The overall rate of nucleotide substitution within the primates is again found to be less than the rest of the mammals. 1974 Springer-Verlag.",

ANIMALS 12 healthy adult German Shepherd Dogs and data previously collected from 16 healthy adult Labrador Retrievers. PROCEDURES German Shepherd Dogs were sedated. One investigator then measured motion of the carpal cubital elbow shoulder tarsal stifle and hip joints of the sedated dogs. Measurements were made in triplicate with a UG and an EG. Radiographs were taken of all joints in maximal flexion and extension. Values were compared between the UG and EG and with values previously determined for joints of 16 Labrador Retrievers. RESULTS An EG had higher variability than a UG for all dogs. The EG variability appeared to result from the technique for the EG. German Shepherd Dogs had lower values in flexion and extension than did Labrador Retrievers for all joints except the carpal joints. German Shepherd Dogs had less motion in the tarsal joints compared with motion for the Labrador Retrievers but had similar motion in all other joints. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A UG is reliable for obtaining measurements in German Shepherd Dogs. There was higher variability for the EG than for the UG and an EG cannot be recommended for use.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspAcute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is a leading cause of cancer-associated death in children. To study the mechanisms of drug resistance in ALL we performed whole-genome sequencing of diagnosis-relapse-germline trios from 103 Chinese patients and ultra-deep sequencing of 208 serial bone marrow samples from 17 of them. Relapse-specific somatic alterations were enriched in 12 genes NR3C1 NR3C2 TP53 NT5C2 FPGS CREBBP MSH2 MSH6 PMS2 WHSC1 PRPS1 and PRPS2 which were predominantly involved in response to thiopurines glucocorticoids methotrexate and other drugs. Four lines of evidence indicate that these resistance mutations frequently developed during treatment rather than pre-existing at diagnosis. First two novel relapse-specific mutational signatures novel signatures 1 and 2 most likely caused by chemotherapeutic regimens were detected in 15 and 14 of relapsed cases respectively. Drug resistance mutations frequently appeared at novel signature-associated trinucleotide contexts indicating that chemotherapy may directly cause drug resistance mutations in ALL. The signatures were validated in NCI TARGET relapsed ALL samples 2 and 23 of which harbored novel signatures 1 and 2 respectively. The varying signature prevalence between cohorts may reflect treatment differences. The novel signatures were not detected in ampgt2000 adult cancers from the PCAWG study. Novel signature 1 induced CampgtG transversions particularly at GCC and TCT trinucleotides and showed transcription-strand bias indicating guanine adducts. Novel signature 2 favored CampgtT and CampgtG mutations at CCG and correlated with relapse-specific dinucleotide variants and structural variants indicating an agent causing multiple mutation types. The drugs inducing these novel signatures are being explored in vitro. Second mathematical modeling using growth curves of drug-resistant ALL indicated that drug resistance mutations occur in some cases long after diagnosis during active treatment. Third some patients acquired multiple drug resistance mutations sequentially through successive relapses a finding inconsistent with their pre-existence at diagnosis. Indeed 20 of relapses had multiple drug resistance mutations targeting different drug classes. Fourth most relapsed ALLs derived from a subclone detected at diagnosis which then evolved additional mutations including drug resistance mutations not detectable at diagnosis using 2000X targeted sequencing. Drug resistance mutations were often subclonal at relapse suggesting later appearance. Together these data indicate that fully drug-resistant clones may not necessarily pre-exist at diagnosis in ALL but may be acquired later during treatment. Thus early intensive or targeted treatment strategies in slow responders may forestall the subsequent development of drug resistance mutations.jatsp jatspCitation Format Benshang Li Samuel W.

All patients underwent patch angioplasty of the proximal anomalous coronary artery with glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium. When the coronary artery coursed between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery the main pulmonary artery was translocated toward the left pulmonary artery to create additional space and prevent compression. RESULTS All patients recovered well and to date have demonstrated no evidence of recurrent myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS The combination of coronary artery angioplasty and translocation of the pulmonary artery seems to effectively address all the mechanisms that can generate ischemia.",

To investigate the most effective and high-throughput proteomic strategy comparative data analysis was performed employing various protein databases and search engines. The UniProt databases of monkey human bovine rat and mouse were used for the comparative analysis and also a universal database with all protein sequences from all available species was tested. At the same time de novo sequencing was compared to the SEQUEST search algorithm to identify an optimal work flow for monkey proteomics. Employing the most effective strategy proteomic profiling of monkey organs identified 3481 proteins at 0.5 FDR from 9 male and 10 female tissues in an automated high-throughput manner. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001972. Based on the success of this alternative interpretation of MS data the list of proteins identified from 12 organs of male and female subjects will benefit future rhesus monkey proteome research.",

    "abstract": "Patients with BCR-ABL1 positive hematologic malignancies and Philadelphia-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL are potential candidates for targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKI. Before TKIs patients with B-ALL had a much worse prognosis and current treatments with targeted TKI therapy have improved outcomes. Thus the detection of BCR-ABL1 is crucial and a false negative BCR-ABL1 result may adversely affect patient care. We report a case of a 76-year-old male with a new diagnosis of B-ALL who was initially found to be BCR-ABL1 negative by quantitative polymerase chain reaction PCR. A concurrent qualitative PCR was performed which detected a positive BCR-ABL1 result that was confirmed by a next generation sequencing NGS based assay and identified as the rare fusion variant e1a3 of p190BCR-ABL. Based on this result the patient was placed on dasatinib as a targeted therapy. In the era of molecular diagnostic medicine and targeted therapy it is essential to have an understanding of the limitations of molecular assays and to follow a comprehensive diagnostic approach in order to detect common abnormalities and rare variants. Incorporating NGS methods in an algorithmic manner into the standard diagnostic PCR-based approach for BCR-ABL1 will aid in minimizing false negative results.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing meningoencephalitis NME affects toy and small breed dogs causing progressive often fatal inflammation and necrosis in the brain. Genetic risk loci for NME previously were identified in pug dogs particularly associated with the dog leukocyte antigen DLA class II complex on chromosome 12 but have not been investigated in other susceptible breeds. We sought to evaluate Maltese and Chihuahua dogs in addition to pug dogs to identify novel or shared genetic risk factors for NME development. Genome-wide association testing of single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in Maltese dogs with NME identified 2 regions of genome-wide significance on chromosomes 4 chr474522353TA p 8.110-7 and 15 chr1553338796AG p 1.510-7. Haplotype analysis and fine-mapping suggests that ILR7 and FBXW7 respectively both important for regulation of immune system function could be the underlying associated genes. Further evaluation of these regions and the previously identified DLA II locus across all three breeds revealed an enrichment of nominal significant SNPs associated with chromosome 15 in pug dogs and DLA II in Maltese and Chihuahua dogs. Meta-analysis confirmed effect sizes the same direction in all three breeds for both the chromosome 15 and DLA II loci p 8.610-11 and p 2.510-7 respectively. This suggests a shared genetic background exists between all breeds and confers susceptibility to NME but effect sizes might be different among breeds. In conclusion we identified the first genetic risk factors for NME development in the Maltese chromosome 4 and chromosome 15 and provide evidence for a shared genetic risk between breeds associated with chromosome 15 and DLA II. Last DLA II and IL7R both have been implicated in human inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis suggesting that similar pharmacotherapeutic targets across species should be investigated.",

Methods Thirty-two patients with metastatic HB were enrolled on Childrens Oncology Group Protocol AHEP0731 and treated with vincristine and irinotecan VI. Responders to VI received two additional cycles of VI intermixed with six cycles of cisplatinfluorouracilvincristinedoxorubicin C5VD and nonresponders received six cycles of C5VD alone. Patients were imaged after every two cycles and at the conclusion of therapy. All computed tomography scans and pathology reports were centrally reviewed and information was collected regarding lung nodule number size laterality timing of resolution and pulmonary surgery. Results Among the 29 evaluable patients only 31 met Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST for measurable metastatic disease. The presence of measurable disease by RECIST the sum of nodule diameters greater than or equal to the cumulative cohort median size bilateral disease and 10 nodules were each associated with an increased risk for an event-free survival event P .48 P .08 P .065 P .03 respectively with nodule number meeting statistical significance. Ten patients underwent pulmonary resectionmetastasectomy at various time points the benefit of which could not be determined because of small patient numbers. Conclusion Children with metastatic HB have a poor prognosis. Overall tumor burden may be an important prognostic factor for these patients. Lesions that fail to meet RECIST size criteria ie those 10 mm at diagnosis may contain viable tumor whereas residual lesions at the end of therapy may constitute eradicated tumorscar tissue. Patients may benefit from risk stratification on the basis of the burden of lung metastatic disease at diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatsp jatspIntroduction We previously demonstrated that receiving all cancer treatment at specialized cancer centers SCCs versus community hospitals through end of therapy is associated with better leukemia-specific survival in children 0-18 years and young adults YA 19-39 years diagnosed with ALL in California. While both age groups benefit from care at a SCC we found only a minority of YAs 36 compared with children 84 received care at a SCC. Our prior findings highlight the need for these patients to be referred to and treated at SCCs but there are potential cost differences associated with this recommendation that have not been previously examined.jatsp jatspMethods Using the California Cancer Registry linked to the Office of Statewide Health and Planning and Development OSHPD statewide hospitalization database we identified children and YAs 19-39 years with first primary ALL who received inpatient treatment from 1995-2014 and had at least 3 years of follow-up. Patients were classified as receiving all or partnone of their treatment at a SCC Childrens Oncology Group or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers for children and National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers for YAs within 3 years of diagnosis to capture the full time of potential primary treatment. Total charges for each admission and hospital level financial information were used to calculate costs adjusted for inflation to 2016 US dollars for each admission excluding peri-partum admissions and those associated with traumatic accidents. One large health maintenance organization system in California did not report charges to OSHPD and was excluded from the analysis 13 of the patient population. In addition patients needed to have at least 80 of charge data to be included in the primary analysis resulting in a study population of 5167 ALL patients. We determined the number of inpatient days and cumulative inpatient costs within 3 years of diagnosis. Mean and median costs overall and per day by age group and location of care were compared using t-tests and Kruskal Wallace tests. We conducted sensitivity analyses 1 limiting our analyses to only patients with all charge data available n5118 and 2 excluding patients with stem cell transplant n693 to determine the impact of these factors on study findings.jatsp jatspResults The mean cost for children receiving all care at SCCs vs non-SCCs was 216439 median121039 vs 191082 median84529 p mean 0.008 p median lt0.001. The cost per day was higher at SCCs mean2840 median2529 than non-SCCs mean2283 median1865 p mean lt 0.001 p median lt 0.001. In children the mean number of inpatient days within 3 years of diagnosis was similar for those who did n70 days and did not 72 days receive all cancer care in SCCs p0.70. Among YAs the mean cost for patients receiving all treatment at SCCs was 380556 median308864 vs 346706 median241847 at non-SCCs p mean0.02 p median lt 0.001. The cost per day was higher at SCCs mean3730 median3537 than non-SCCs mean3224 median2917 p mean lt 0.001 p median lt 0.001. YAs receiving all cancer care at SCCs 99 days had a similar mean number of inpatient days to those receiving care at non-SCCs 101 days p0.97. In the sensitivity analyses excluding patients receiving a transplant the mean cost was lower at both SCCs and non-SCCs but the differences in costs in children and YAs by location of care remained. In addition results were similar when analyses were limited to patients with complete charge data.jatsp jatspConclusion In this large population-based cohort of pediatric and YA patients with ALL we found that inpatient costs and number of inpatient days were higher among YAs than children with ALL. In addition in each age group the costs of inpatient care during the full course of therapy for primary ALL was higher in patients receiving all of their care at SCCs compared patients receiving part or none of their care at an SCC. As inpatient costs do not reflect the total burden associated with cancer care future studies should consider how location of care impacts outpatient emergency department and out-of-pocket costs. Given findings of better outcomes among children and YAs receiving all care at SCCs we believe the marginal increased cost should be considered in view of the better outcomes at SCCs.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive air quality modeling project was carried out to simulate size and composition resolved airborne particulate matter concentrations in northern and central California using the pollutant concentration and meteorological data collected during the California Regional PM10PM2.5 Air Quality Study CRPAQS from December 15 2000 to January 7 2001. Measured 24-h average PM2.5 concentrations during this time period exceeded 180 g m-3 at Bakersfield making it the most severe PM2.5 air quality episode ever recorded in the United States with a rigorous measurement database to support modeling. In this paper the UCDCIT source-oriented air quality model is used to predict the concentrations of O3 NO NO2 CO elemental carbon EC organic compounds OC nitrate and PM2.5 mass concentration over a 24-day period using a horizontal resolution of 4 km 4 km to cover all of central California. This is the first extensive evaluation of an air quality model in central California using the fine spatial resolution appropriate for the mountain-valley topography of the region combined with the relatively long multi-week time scales associated with winter stagnation events. Fractional bias FB values were calculated at all sites on each day of the study to quantify model performance. The CO FB -0.5 to 0.3 O3 FB -0.5 to 0.25 NO FB -0.9 to -0.1 and NO2 FB 0 to 0.4 concentrations predicted by the UCDCIT model are in general agreement with observations at most monitoring stations throughout the Valley. The predicted PM2.5 concentrations FB -0.5 to 0.75 generally agree with observations at Bethel Island Sacramento Fresno and Bakersfield spanning the entire length of the model domain. PM2.5 concentrations are over-predicted at the remote monitoring site Angiola in the central portion of the domain. Part of the over-prediction is due to excess fugitive dust emissions. CO NO EC and OC were all under-predicted at Angiola indicating possible missing combustion sources in the emission inventory. The regional nitrate FB -1.5 to 1.25 formation dynamics were correctly reproduced by the model simulation but imperfect wind fields cause differences between the predicted vs. measured spatial distribution of nitrate during the last several days of simulation leading to the broader range of fraction bias. Overall the results of the current study confirm the ability of the air quality model to capture the major features of a severe particulate air pollution event in northern and central California providing a foundation for future studies on source apportionment and emissions control. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS All members of the Society of Surgical Chairs a program of the American College of Surgeons were e-mailed an IRB-approved 28-question electronic survey in fall 2017. Up to 3 reminders were sent. RESULTS Responses from 129186 69 departments of surgery were received. Nearly all departments 96 continue to have a departmental MM conference. The MM conference is typically weekly 93 between 7 and 9 AM 80 on weekdays during which there are no scheduled elective operations 84. Attendance is mandatory for residents 98 but required for faculty in only 49 of departments. Fewer than half of all departments 44 have written guidelines as to which complications should be reported to MM. Most conferences are prepared case presentations 89 but may include unprepared discussions 17 case-based educational presentations 30 or a combination 28. The most common classification category was by root case of the error 60 and preventability 58. Most departments keep electronic andor physical MM reports while 21 maintain a relational database and 25 do not retain records. While almost all 96 departments reported participating in at least one national quality improvement program these are not often linked to the MM process. CONCLUSIONS MM is predominantly seen as an educational conference based on a few select cases. Departmental quality is monitored with hospital-driven or national quality improvement efforts. Integration of hospital-based quality metric programs with surgery MM conference is uncommon and represents an opportunity for hospital-department collaboration.",

It is critical to understand the presence of tau in peripheral tissues since this may provide new insights into disease progression and selective vulnerability. The current study sought to determine the presence of select tau species in peripheral tissues in elderly individuals and across an array of tauopathies. Using formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections we examined abdominal skin submandibular gland and sigmoid colon among 69 clinicopathologically defined cases 19 lacking a clinical neuropathological diagnosis normal controls 26 progressive supranuclear palsy PSP 21 Alzheimers disease AD and 3 with corticobasal degeneration CBD. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies for total tau HT7 and two phosphorylated tau species AT8 and pT231. HT7 staining of abdominal skin revealed immunoreactivity of potential nerve elements in 5 of cases 1 AD 1 ADPSP and 1 CBD out of 55 cases examined skin sections lacked AT8 and pT231 immunoreactive nerve elements. Submandibular glands from all cases had HT7 immunoreactive nerve elements while pT231 was present in 92 of cases and AT8 in only 3 cases 2 AD and one ADPSP case. In sigmoid colon HT7 immunoreactivity was present in all but 2 cases 97 pT231 in 54 and AT8 was present in only 562 cases 8. These data suggest select tau species in CNS tauopathies do not have a high propensity to spread to the periphery and this may hold clues for the understanding of CNS tau pathogenicity and vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To develop a research ethics training course for American IndianAlaskan Native health clinic staff and community researchers who would be conducting human subjects research. METHOD Community-based participatory research methods were used in facilitated discussions of research ethics centered around topics included in the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative research ethics course. RESULTS The community-based participatory research approach allowed all partners to jointly develop a research ethics training program that was relevant for American IndianAlaskan Native communities. All community and clinic partners were able to pass the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative course they were required to pass so that they could be certified to conduct research with human subjects on federally funded projects. In addition the training sessions provided a foundation for increased community oversight of research. CONCLUSIONS By using a collaborative process to engage community partners in research ethics discussions rather than either an asynchronous online or a lecturepresentation format resulted in significant mutual learning about research ethics and community concerns about research. This approach requires university researchers to invest time in learning about the communities in which they will be working prior to the training.",

The aim of this study was to qualitatively compare ex-vivo MR images of the same equine feet obtained at three magnetic field strengths 0.27 1.5 and 3 tesla T. Ten cadaver feet were used. All feet were imaged with two high-field systems 3T 1.5T and with a low-field LF system at 0.27 T designed for standing horses. Images were acquired using similar pulse sequences in all 3 MR units. MR images were subjectively evaluated by three independent experienced image analysts for image quality and clarity of visualization of individual anatomical structures using a four-point grading scale. The images from all of the examinations were considered to be of diagnostic value except for the hoof capsule where substantial artifacts were present in LF images with distortion and loss of signal at the dorsaldistal aspect of the hoof capsule in LF images. Anatomical structure scoring values of images obtained at 3T and 1.5T were significantly greater than scores of images obtained at 0.27T. Scores for images obtained at 3T were significantly higher than those for images obtained at 1.5T. Mean score differences between 1.5T and 3T were higher for cartilage of the distal interphalangeal joint and for the ungular cartilages. 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "Network-on-Chips NoCs are used to connect large numbers of processors in many-core processor architecture because they perform better than less scalable methods such as global shared buses. Among all NoC design parameters NoC topologies define how nodes are placed and connected and greatly affect the performance energy efficiency and circuit area of many-core processor arrays. Due to its simplicity and the fact that processor tiles are traditionally square or rectangular 2D mesh is mostly used for existing on-chip networks. However efficiently mapping applications can be a challenge for cases that require communication between processors that are not adjacent on the 2D mesh. Motivated by the fact that applications often have largely localized communication patterns we have proposed an 8-neighbor mesh topology and a 6-neighbor topology with hexagonal-shaped processor tiles both of which increase local connectivity while keep much of the simplicity of a mesh-based topology. We have physically designed a 16-bit DSP processor and the corresponding processor arrays which utilize all three topologies. A 1080p H.264AVC residual video encoder and a 54 Mbps 802.11a11g OFDM wireless LAN baseband receiver are mapped onto all topologies. The 6-neighbor hexagonal grid topology incurs a 2.9 area increase per tile compared to the 4-neighbor 2D mesh but its much more effective inter-processor interconnect yields an average total application area reduction of 21 an average power reduction of 17 and a total application inter-processor communication distance reduction of 19.",

Of 23 gene candidates we assigned eight genes to the PIP2 subfamily. All eight putative genes were expressed in vegetative tissues roots leaves bark and wood and all of them showed water channel activity after being expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Six of eight proteins were affected by mercury ions. No proteins were affected by the presence of nickel or tungsten ions or by lowering the pH of bathing external solution from 7.4 to 6.5. The presence of copper ions caused seven of eight PIP2 proteins to increase their water transport capacity by as much as 50.

Few have investigated the effect of surgical resident involvement SRI on operative parameters. Examining 7 common general surgery procedures we evaluated the effect of SRI on perioperative morbidity and mortality and operative time OpT. STUDY DESIGN The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database 2005 to 2007 was used to identify 7 cases of nonemergent operations. Cases with simultaneous procedures were excluded. Logistic regression was performed across all procedures and within each procedure incorporating SRI OpT and risk-stratifying American College of Surgery National Surgical Quality Improvement Program morbidity and mortality probability scores which incorporate multiple prognostic individual patient factors. Procedure-specific SRI-stratified OpTs were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS A total of 71.3 of the 37907 cases had SRI. Absolute 30-day morbidity for all cases with SRI and without SRI were 3.0 and 1.0 respectively p 0.001 absolute 30-day mortality for all cases with SRI and without SRI were 0.1 and 0.08 respectively p 0.001. After multivariate analysis by specific procedure SRI was not associated with increased morbidity but was associated with decreased mortality during open right colectomy odds ratio 0.32 p 0.01. Across all procedures SRI was associated with increased morbidity odds ratio 1.14 p 0.048 but decreased mortality odds ratio 0.42 p 0.001. Mean OpT for all procedures was consistently lower for cases without SRI. CONCLUSIONS SRI has a measurable impact on both 30-day morbidity and mortality and OpT. These data have implications to the impact associated with surgical graduate medical education. Further studies to identify causes of patient morbidity and prevention strategies in surgical teaching environments are warranted.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This study examines clinical functional and CT metrics of sarcopenia and all-cause mortality in older adults undergoing outpatient imaging. METHODS The study included outpatients 65 years of age undergoing CT or PETCT at a tertiary care institution. Assessments included screening questionnaires for sarcopenia SARC-F and frailty FRAIL scale and measurements of grip strength and usual gait speed 6 m course. Skeletal muscle area SMA index SMI areaheight2 and density SMD were measured on CT at T12 and L3. A modified SMI was also examined SMI-m areaheight. Mortality risk was studied with Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS The study included 416 patients mean age 73.8 years sd 6.2 mean follow-up 2.9 years sd 1.34. Abnormal grip SARC-F and FRAIL scale assessments were associated with higher mortality risk HR 95CI 2.0 1.4-2.9 1.6 1.1-2.3 2.0 1.4-2.8. Adjusting for age higher L3-SMA T12-SMA T12-SMI and T12-SMI-m were associated with lower mortality risk HR 95CI 0.80 0.65-0.90 0.76 0.64-0.90 0.84 0.70-1.00 and 0.80 0.67-0.90 respectively. T12-SMD and L3-SMD were not predictive of mortality. After adjusting for abnormal grip strength and FRAIL scale assessments T12-SMA and T12-SMI-m remained predictive of mortality risk HR 95CI 0.83 0.70-1.00 and 0.80 0.67-0.97 respectively. CONCLUSION CT areal metrics were weaker predictors of all-cause mortality than clinical and functional metrics of sarcopenia in our older patient cohort a CT density metric SMD was not predictive. Of areal CT metrics SMI areaheight2 appeared to be less effective than non-normalized SMA or SMA normalized by height1.",

    "abstract": "The search for efficient approaches to realize local switching of magnetic moments in spintronic devices has attracted extensive attention. One of the most promising approaches is the electrical manipulation of magnetization through electron-mediated spin torque. However the Joule heat generated via electron motion unavoidably causes substantial energy dissipation and potential damage to spintronic devices. Here all-oxide heterostructures of SrRuO3 NiOSrIrO3 are epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 single-crystal substrates following the order of the ferromagnetic transition metal oxide SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy insulating and antiferromagnetic NiO and metallic transition metal oxide SrIrO3 with strong spin-orbit coupling. It is demonstrated that instead of the electron spin torques the magnon torques present in the antiferromagnetic NiO layer can directly manipulate the perpendicular magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. This magnon mechanism may significantly reduce the electron motion-related energy dissipation from electron-mediated spin currents. Interestingly the threshold current density to generate a sufficient magnon current to manipulate the magnetization is one order of magnitude smaller than that in conventional metallic systems. These findings suggest a route for developing highly efficient all-oxide spintronic devices operated by magnon current.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Primary malignancies of the adrenal glands are rare. Epidemiologic assessment of primary adrenal malignancies is lacking and has been limited to case reports and series. Population-level data can provide a better understanding of the incidence distribution and prognostic factors associated with these rare malignancies. METHODS The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database 1973-2013 was queried for all patients who were diagnosed with primary adrenal malignancies categorized in 5 histologic groups adrenocortical carcinoma ACC pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma PH neuroblastoma NE non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL and sarcoma SA. Age-adjusted incidence distribution trends and cancer-specific survival CSS for each group were analyzed. RESULTS In total 4695 patients with primary adrenal malignancies were identified including 2057 with ACC 512 with PH 1863 with NE 202 with NHL and 61 with SA. The age-adjusted incidence of all 5 histologic subtypes was rising. Age at presentation differed substantially by histologic group NE was the most prevalent during the first decade of life whereas ACC predominated after age 30 years and NHL outnumbered PH after age 70 years. Patient-specific factors were not associated with advanced disease at the time of presentation. The 5-year CSS rate for each histologic subtype was 38 for ACC 69 for PH 64 for NE 38 for NHL and 42 for SA. Survival outcomes for patients with ACC NHL PH and SA remained unchanged over the 40-year study period. Multimodal therapy was associated with higher CSS in patients with NE. CONCLUSIONS This first population-level analysis of all primary adrenal malignancies provides important initial data regarding presentation and clinical outcomes. Notably except for patients with NE the survival of patients with these rare cancers has not improved over the past 40 years.",

    "abstract": "Fish health can be affected by many environmental factors including infection with pathogens. Infectious disease can lead to high mortality in wild populations and in aquaculture resulting in significant economic losses. Teleost fishes share a highly conserved response to pathogen infections starting with an immediate activation of the innate immune response before shifting to an adaptive immune response. Fishes also show altered transcriptomic expression in stress-related genes during acute and chronic infections. The ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis Ich is one of the most widely distributed ectoparasites for freshwater fish providing the possibility to identify infection severity via phenotypical assessments. Molecular markers are increasingly incorporated in health assessments and to determine sublethal physiological responses to stressors. We evaluated the effects of an infection with Ich using the pelagic fish species delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus as a model. We investigated transcriptional changes of ten genes belonging to the innate immune response and five heat shock genes related to thermal and general stress response. Molecular assessments were conducted in three tissues gill spleen and kidney and collected from fish with different infection intensities. The combination of molecular markers including immune and stress-related genes resulted in significant differentiation between infection levels in all tissue types. The strongest results were observed in gill and kidney however the detection of infection severity was most effective when combining the transcriptomic results from all tissues. Chemokine cxcb was the most responsive gene in all tissues and provided significant upregulation in fish with visible Ich-infection. The identification of molecular markers targeting fundamental host responses associated with infections is contributing to the establishment of techniques to assess fish health in natural habitats and in aquaculture.",

Among taxa beta diversity showed no tendency to be higher in poorer dispersers. In nearly all taxa beta diversity increased linearly with distance on the N-S transect but this was largely the effect of gradients in alpha local within-square diversity. Moreover distance is highly correlated with environmental climatic dissimilarity providing an alternative explanation for distance effects. In the British biota turnover at this scale is more the product of range and habitat restriction than of dispersal limitation turnover is a relatively minor component of regional diversity because of the predominance of strong gradients in alpha diversity. -from Authors",

Protein-bound N-linked glycans were released with peptidyl N-glycosidase F PNGase F enriched by graphitized carbon chromatography and analyzed with Chip-TOF MS. To be defined as N-glycans compounds were required in all three procedural replicates to match within 6 ppm against a theoretical human N-glycan library and be at least 2-fold higher in abundance in PNGase F-treated than in control samples. Fifty-two N-linked glycan compositions were identified and 24 were confirmed via tandem mass spectra analysis. Twenty-seven compositions have been found previously in human milk and 25 are novel compositions. By abundance 84 of N-glycans were fucosylated and 47 were sialylated. The majority 70 of total N-glycan abundance was composed of N-glycans found in all three milk samples.",

    "abstract": "Malted barley Hordeum vulgare is a crucial component of beer and it has been established that barley genotype has an effect on malting quality and beer flavor. This study extends this exploration by evaluating the effects of genotype environment and management on malting quality. Five fall-planted malting barley lines were grown in three locations each representing a distinct growing environment in the Pacific Northwest United States and under nitrogen N treatments control N1 and N application at heading in addition to the control N2. Genotype location interactions were observed for all agronomic yield test weight and grain quality metrics grain protein plumpness and N treatment genotype interactions were observed for grain protein and plumpness. Overall N2 increased grain protein without exceeding specifications by almost 1 point. Based on random forest analysis the major driver of all-malt index score was grain protein followed by peak gelatinization temperature germination energy and water sensitivity. Still over 70 of variation in all-malt index score was unexplained which is likely due to genotype and location differences as indicated by principal component analysis. This research confirms the agronomic potential of fall-planted malting barley in the Pacific Northwest and although micromalted samples did not meet industry specifications trends were identified that indicate the potential for these varieties at these locations. This research also demonstrates the potential of N management to fine-tune malting quality through grain protein and that malting quality is influenced by genotype and environment though many of the specific drivers remain unknown.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pneumomediastinum occurs in up to 10 of patients with blunt thoracic and cervical trauma. Mandatory evaluation of all patients with bronchoscopy and esophageal imaging to exclude a major injury has been recommended. There is little data on the safety or efficacy of this approach. We evaluated the incidence of major injuries associated with pneumomediastinum the accuracy of diagnostic modalities and the results of observation versus aggressive evaluation. METHODS Medical records of all blunt trauma patients diagnosed with pneumomediastinum andor aerodigestive tract injury between 1998 and 2005 were reviewed. The patients hospital course was reviewed for demographic data admission diagnoses diagnostic imaging and procedures operations missed injuries length of stay and mortality. RESULTS The review identified a total of 136 patients with pneumomediastinum and an additional 22 patients with thoracic aerodigestive tract injuries but without pneumomediastinum. Only patients with pneumomediastinum were considered in subsequent analysis. Pneumomediastinum was detected by CT scan in all 136 100 patients although identified on plain radiograph in only 20 15 patients. Computed tomography findings were suspicious for a major aerodigestive tract injury in 27 20 patients. Ten 37 of these 27 patients had an injury requiring operative intervention five 4 laryngeal injuries three 2 tracheal disruptions and two 1 esophageal perforations. Eighty-one patients 60 never had endoscopic evaluation. There were no delayed diagnoses missed injuries or complications in the observation-only cohort. The overall sensitivity and specificity of CT scan for major aerodigestive tract injury was 100 and 85 respectively. CONCLUSION Major airway or esophageal injury is an uncommon cause of pneumomediastinum. CT scan was able to identify patients at high risk for aerodigestive injury in all cases and should be the preferred screening tool for airway injury in patients with pneumomediastinum.",

Single-site precision analytical sensitivity and specificity limit of detection and diagnostic performance were assessed in comparison to reference methods at three independent sites. Single-site precision across all genotype categories showed 100 agreement at 20 ng input across multiple operators days instruments and kit lots. Compared to Southern Blot analysis the overall percent agreement was over 98 for all expanded alleles.Expert Opinion Limitations include no methylation assessment and hard to see full mutation peaks in some mosaic samples but overall the assay is considered a highly accurate and time-efficient assay for FMR1 allele size determination.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the delivery of surgical services. The purpose of this communication was to report the impact of the pandemic on surgical training and learner well-being and to document adaptations made by surgery departments. STUDY DESIGN A 37-item survey was distributed to educational leaders in general surgery and other surgical specialty training programs. It included both closed- and open-ended questions and the self-reported stages of GME during the COVID-19 pandemic as defined by the ACGME. Statistical associations for items with stage were assessed using categorical analysis. RESULTS The response rate was 21 472 of 2196. US stage distribution n 447 was as follows stage 1 22 stage 2 48 and stage 3 30. Impact on clinical education significantly increased by stage with severe reductions in nonemergency operations 73 and 86 vs 98 and emergency operations 8 and 16 vs 34. Variable effects were reported on minimal expected case numbers across all stages. Reductions were reported in outpatient experience 83 in-hospital experience 70 and outside rotations 57. Increases in ICU rotations were reported with advancing stage 7 and 13 vs 37. Severity of impact on didactic education increased with stage 14 and 30 vs 46. Virtual conferences were adopted by 97 across all stages. Severity of impact on learner well-being increased by stage-physical safety 6 and 9 vs 31 physical health 0 and 7 vs 17 and emotional health 11 and 24 vs 42. Regardless of stage most but not all made adaptations to support trainees well-being. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic adversely impacted surgical training and the well-being of learners across all surgical specialties proportional to increasing ACGME stage. There is a need to develop education disaster plans to support technical competency and learner well-being. Careful assessment for program advancement will also be necessary. The experience during this pandemic shows that virtual learning and telemedicine will have a considerable impact on the future of surgical education.",

This study examined domain-specific effects of common neuropathologies on cognition using data N 652 from two large cohort studies of older adults. We first identified dimensions of a battery of 17 neuropsychological tests and regional measures of Alzheimers disease AD neuropathology. We then evaluated how cognitive factors were related to dimensions of AD and additional measures of cerebrovascular and Lewy Body disease and also examined independent effects of brain weight. All cognitive domains had multiple neuropathology determinants that differed by domain. Neocortical neurofibrillary tangles were the strongest predictors of most domains while medial temporal tangles showed a weaker relationship with episodic memory. Neuritic plaques had relatively strong effects on multiple domains. Lewy bodies and macroscopic infarcts were associated with all domains while microscopic infarcts had more limited associations. Brain weight was related to all domains independent of specific neuropathologies. Results show that cognition is complexly determined by multiple disease substrates. Neuropathological variables and brain weight contributed approximately a third to half of the explained variance in different cognitive domains.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To investigate both the feasibility and the adequacy of pelvic lymph node dissection PLND during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy RALP by comparing lymph node yields obtained during RALP with those obtained during traditional open retropubic radical prostatectomy RRP. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 1047 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2001 and 2009. In all 626 patients underwent RALP while 421 patients had traditional open RRP. All patients undergoing bilateral PLND were included in our analysis. Lymph node yields and lymph node involvement for each surgical approach were calculated and examined. PLND-related complications were analysed. RESULTS Of the 1047 patients 816 patients underwent bilateral PLND of whom 473 underwent RALP while 343 underwent RRP. The mean lymph node yields for the RALP cohort 7.1 interquartile range 4-10 was significantly higher P 0.001 than for the RRP cohort 6.0 interquartile range 3-8. The percentage of patients with nodal involvement was 1.1 for RALP and 2.3 for RRP P 0.167. Mean age preoperative PSA values and pre- and postoperative Gleason scores were similar between the two cohorts. PLND-related complications were similar between both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing RALP PLND is feasible and provides lymph node yields comparable with those of the standard open approach. PLND should be strongly considered in all radical prostatectomy patients when clinically indicated regardless of surgical technique.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD patients with exacerbations despite optimized bronchodilator therapy roflumilast and chronic azithromycin are recommended options. Roflumilast is recommended in severe COPD patients with chronic bronchitis whereas chronic azithromycin is more broadly indicated. The comparative effectiveness between these 2 treatments to reduce exacerbation rate remains unclear. OBJECTIVES Our objective was analysis of the Veterans Health Administration VHA database medication and claims data without lung function or presence of chronic bronchitis or tobacco use to compare the effectiveness of roflumilast and azithromycin on hospitalizations and mortality. METHODS The primary outcome of the study was cumulative incidences of first COPD-related and all-cause hospitalization. Sensitivity analysis on hospitalizations was conducted for VHA patients who also had Medicare. RESULTS In 1302 roflumilast and 2573 azithromycin patients the all-cause mortality rates at 1 year were 19 and 15 respectively. The median times-to-all-cause death were 47 months interquartile range IQR 16-81 for the roflumilast and 48 months IQR 20-83 for the azithromycin groups. Roflumilast was associated with higher mortality hazard ratio HR 1.16 95 confidence interval CI 1.04-1.29. Roflumilast showed no significant association for COPD-related hospitalization subdistribution HR SHR1.14 95 CI 1.00-1.29 and all-cause hospitalization HR 1.07 95 CI 0.97-1.18. For patients with Medicare N2030 roflumilast was associated with higher COPD-related SHR 1.21 95 CI 1.05-1.41 and all-cause SHR 1.23 95 CI 1.09-1.38 hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS Roflumilast was associated with higher hazard ratios for death COPD-related hospitalizations and all-cause hospitalizations in COPD patients only after adjustment for VHA and external Medicare events. Prospective clinical trials are needed to directly compare the relative efficacy of these therapies.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of CBD on immune function by measuring inflammatory cytokines and antibody responses to vaccination as well as other health parameters in senior horses. Horses were orally-dosed with CBD 2 mgkg 13 horses or control soy oil 14 horses daily for 90 days from July 2021 to November 2021. Peripheral blood samples were collected on days 0 30 60 and 90 before administering treatments. On day 90 all horses were kept on treatment and vaccinated with an equine influenza vaccine and blood samples were collected post-vaccination on days 14 and 21. For all time points plasma samples were analyzed for determination of CBD and metabolites 7-OH CBD and 7-COOH CBD using tandem mass spectrometry. For time points 0 30 60 and 90 blood samples were analyzed for CBC and chemistry. Additionally peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were isolated stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate PMA and ionomycin stained intracellularly for interferon gamma IFN- and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF- then analyzed via flow cytometry. Real-time PCR RT-PCR analyzed both stimulated PBMCs and whole blood for cytokine gene expression. Inflammatory proteins C-reactive protein interleukin 1 receptor agonist and prostaglandin E2 were measured with equine-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test and oral sugar test were performed on all horses before and after the study to analyze metabolic function. Hemagglutination inhibition HI titers were measured for immune responses pre- and post-vaccination. All data were analyzed using either a paired t-test or a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance significance P 0.05. Plasma concentrations of CBD and metabolites were determined with 7-COOH CBD the most significant metabolite in CBD treated horses compared to control treated horses. A significant decrease was determined for whole blood inflammatory cytokine expression of IFN- at day 60 and for IL6 at day 60 and 90 for CBD-treated horses when compared to control horses. CBD did not significantly affect any other immune factors HI titers or health parameters. This study demonstrated that treatment with CBD reduced some inflammatory cytokine production with no negative side effects as measured by CBC or chemistry profiles. This study reveals the initial understanding of CBD in the horse however more in-depth research is needed to fully understand its efficacy on the health of the horse.",

By summing the contributions from all graphs consisting of closed loops we find that the low-hole-density ferromagnetic susceptibility diverges exponentially as expT as T0 in two and higher dimensions. This demonstrates that the Nagaoka-Thouless ferromagnetic state exists as a thermodynamic state of matter at low enough density of holes and sufficiently low temperatures.

The bio-activators were mixed with a fermenting bed fb material consisting of rice husk and rice bran mixed in a ratio of 11. The inoculated fb was then used in concentrations of 0 20 and 40 in a composting process of food waste. The composting process was monitored daily for 48 days and the quality of the final compost based on its physical and chemical characteristics was measured and compared. The result revealed that all samples containing 40 fb material with both Tak and EM bio- A ctivator contained lower moisture content in the final compost compared to samples with 20 fb material. The CN ratio of the samples with 20 fb material for all samples decreased to 201 while 40 fb material increased above 201 compared to its initial level. Furthermore the nitrogen level for all samples with 20 fb material increased while samples with 40 fb material decreased from the initial level. The phosphorus and potassium content also increased for all samples with both 20 and 40 fb material from the initial level. Additionally no significant difference could be found for the final compost quality between the two bio-activators.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is now the only solid organ cancer in which therapy is commonly applied to the whole gland. One of the main challenges in adopting focal boost or true focal therapy is in the accurate mapping of cancer foci defined on magnetic resonance MR images onto the computerised tomography CT images used for radiotherapy planning. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prostate cancer patients n 14 previously treated at the Edinburgh Cancer Centre ECC were selected for this study. All patients underwent MR scanning for the purpose of diagnosis and staging. Patients received three months of androgen deprivation hormone therapy followed by a radiotherapy planning CT scan. The dominant focal prostate lesions were identified on MR scans by a radiologist and a novel image analysis approach was used to map the location of the dominant focal lesion from MR to CT. An offline planning study was undertaken on suitable patients n 7 to investigate boosting of the radiation dose to the tumour using a stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy SABR technique. RESULTS The non-rigid registration algorithm showed clinically acceptable estimates of the location of the dominant focal disease on all CT image data of patients suitable for a boost treatment. Standard rigid registration was found to produce unacceptable estimates of the dominant focal lesion on CT. A SABR boost dose of 47.5 Gy was delivered to the dominant focal lesion of all patients whilst meeting all dose-volume histogram DVH constraints. Normal tissue complication probability NTCP for the rectum decreased from 1.28 to 0.73 with this method. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results demonstrate the potential of this image analysis method for reliably mapping dominant focal disease within the prostate from MR images onto planning CT images. Significant dose escalation using a simultaneous integrated SABR boost was achieved in all patients.",

Given the overlap in these constructs it is unclear if these represent distinct impairments or different manifestations of one higher-order impairment. To examine this question we administered tasks from the basic cognitive neuroscience literature to measure visual selective attention working memory capacity and executive function in 126 people with schizophrenia and 122 healthy volunteers. Patients demonstrated deficits on all tasks with the exception of selective attention guided by strong bottom-up inputs. Although the measures of top-down control of selective attention working memory and executive function were all intercorrelated several sources of evidence indicate that working memory and executive function are separate sources of variance. Specifically both working memory and executive function independently contributed to the discrimination of group status and independently accounted for variance in overall general cognitive ability as assessed by the MATRICS battery. These two cognitive functions appear to be separable features of the cognitive impairments observed in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Fumigation with either gas cartridges or aluminum phosphide is often considered to be an effective method for controlling California ground squirrel populations although few studies have corroborated their effectiveness. Additionally utilizing aluminum phosphide in combination with gas cartridges could increase effectiveness of both fumigants by indicating additional burrow openings through escaping smoke from gas cartridges and allowing for treatment of these additional openings with aluminum phosphide which is a cheaper and potentially more effective material. Therefore we compared the efficacy of gas cartridges aluminum phosphide and a combined treatment on ground squirrel populations from mid-April through early May 2009 to determine which was most effective. We established 4 plots 3 treatments plus control at each of 2 treatment sites in Madera County California. All plots were between 1 and 2 ha in size with survey areas of 0.3 - 0.5 ha centrally located within the plot. Ground squirrels were visually counted within survey areas for 3 consecutive days prior to treatment. Following counting treatments were applied. Forty-eight hours post-treatment squirrels were again counted within survey areas to determine percent control. These counts were repeated the following 2 days. All treatments were then reapplied for the same plots with similar surveys again following 48 hours post-treatment. We found that all fumigation methods resulted in marginal to exceptional control of ground squirrels percent control gas cartridges 62 - 86 aluminum phosphide 97 - 100 gas cartridges aluminum phosphide 59 - 71. We suggest aluminum phosphide use could be expanded to increase ground squirrel control in California given its high efficacy combined with its relatively cheap material cost.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether systematic bias in attenuation measurements occurs among CT scanners made by four major manufacturers and the relevance of this bias regarding opportunistic screening for osteoporosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on attenuation measurement accuracy were acquired using the American College of Radiology ACR accreditation phantom and were evaluated in a blinded fashion for four CT manufacturers 8500 accreditation submissions for manufacturer A 18575 for manufacturer B 8278 for manufacturer C and 32039 for manufacturer D. The attenuation value for water acrylic surrogate for trabecular bone and Teflon surrogate for cortical bone Chemours materials for an adult abdominal CT technique 120 kV 240 mA standard reconstruction algorithm was used in the analysis. Differences in attenuation value across all manufacturers were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. RESULTS. The mean attenuation value for water ranged from -0.3 to 2.7 HU with highly significant differences among all manufacturers p 0.001. For the trabecular bone surrogate differences in attenuation values across all manufacturers were also highly significant p 0.001 with mean values of 120.9 SD 3.5 124.6 3.3 126.9 4.4 and 123.9 3.4 HU for manufacturers A B C and D respectively. For the cortical bone surrogate differences in attenuation values across all manufacturers were also highly significant p 0.001 with mean values of 939.0 14.2 874.3 13.3 897.6 11.3 and 912.7 13.4 HU for manufacturers A B C and D respectively. CONCLUSION. CT scanners made by different manufacturers show systematic offsets in attenuation measurement when compared with each other. Knowledge of these off-sets is useful for optimizing the accuracy of opportunistic diagnosis of osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "Surface sediment samples 0-5 cm from five tidal marshes along the coast of California USA were analyzed for organic pollutants to investigate their relationship to land use current distribution within marshes and possible sources. Among the study areas Stege Marsh located in San Francisco Bay was the most contaminated. Compared to San Francisco Bay Stege Marsh had much higher levels of organic contaminants such as PCBs polychlorinated biphenyls DDTs and chlordanes. At reference marshes Toms Point and Walker Creek in Tomales Bay organic contaminants in sediments were very low. While PAHs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found at all of the study areas 22-13600 ng g-1 measurable concentrations of PCBs were found only in the sediments from Stege Marsh 80-9940 ng g-1. Combustion related pyrogenic high molecular weight PAHs were dominant in sediments from Stege and Carpinteria Marshes while in sediments from Toms Point and Walker Creek petroleum related petrogenic low molecular weight PAHs and alkyl-substituted PAHs were much more abundant than pyrogenic PAHs. PCB congener patterns in all of the Stege Marsh samples were the same and revealed that Aroclor 1248 was a predominant source. In all marshes the sum of DDE and DDD accounted for more than 90 of total DDTs indicating that DDT has degraded significantly. The ratios of pp-DDE to pp-DDD in sediments from Stege Marsh provide evidence of possible previous use of technical DDD. Chlordane ratios indicated that chlordanes have degraded slightly. Bis2-ethylhexylphthalate 280-32000 ng g-1 was the most abundant phthalate. The data indicates that Stege Marsh may be a source of contaminants that continue to be discharged into San Francisco Bay.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE In this systematic review the authors examine the prevalence and extent of stigmatizing attitudes among health care professionals HCPs and trainees against patients with substance use disorders SUDs including research on interventions to reduce stigma. METHOD The authors searched 7 databases for articles published from January 1 2011 through February 15 2023 that quantified SUD stigma among HCPs or trainees. Inclusion criteria allowed both observational and intervention studies from the United States or Canada to be included in this review. Quality assessment was applied to all included studies studies were not excluded based on quality. RESULTS A total of 1992 unique articles were identified of which 32 articles 17 observational studies and 15 intervention studies all conducted in the United States met the inclusion criteria. Half of the included studies 16 of 32 were published in 2020 or later. Most of the intervention studies 13 of 15 used a single-group pre-post design interventions involved didactics andor interactions with persons with SUDs. The 32 included studies used a total of 19 different measures of stigma. All 17 observational studies showed some degree of HCP or trainee stigma against patients with SUDs. Most intervention studies 12 of 15 found small but statistically significant reductions in stigma after intervention. CONCLUSIONS SUD stigma exists among HCPs and trainees. Some interventions to reduce this stigma had positive impacts but future studies with larger diverse participants and comparison groups are needed. Heterogeneity among studies and stigma measures limits the ability to interpret results across studies. Future rigorous research is needed to determine validated consensus measures of SUD stigma among HCPs and trainees identify stigma scores that are associated with clinical outcomes and develop effective antistigma interventions for HCPs and trainees.",

    "abstract": "Mortality patterns in an old-growth mixed-conifer forest in the absence of wildfire were investigated at the Teakettle Experimental Forest from 2000 to 2002. We tested the hypothesis that after a century of fire suppression pathogen- and insect-associated mortality between episodic droughts would be significantly greater on ingrowth trees i.e. smaller-diameter shade-tolerant species in high-density clusters. Using a survey of over 30000 mapped trees overall mortality as measured by standing dead trees was 8.7 of all stems 5 cm dbh. Mortality levels were proportional to the population size of the five dominant conifer species white fir Abies concolor red fir A. magnified incense cedar Calocedrus decurrens Jeffrey pine Pinus jeffreyi and sugar pine Pinus lambertiana. There was also no significant difference in mortality between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species. All dead trees were clustered within plots. Mortality was significantly higher than expected for large-diameter trees 100 cm dbh with all conifer species combined and for each individual species except Jeffrey pine. Small-diameter dead trees were grouped in high-density clusters. Mortality was less than expected among small-diameter trees 5-20 cm dbh for all species combined red and white fir and sugar pine. Mortality for all conifers was higher than expected in areas of high stand density and lower in areas of low stand density. Mortality of small-diameter trees was clustered and particularly high in areas of high stand density. Our data suggest pathogen- and insect-associated mortality is significantly greater in areas of high stand density but it is not higher for shade-tolerant species. Furthermore mortality is higher than expected for large-diameter trees suggesting an acceleration of old-tree mortality under current fire suppression conditions.

Our objective was to compare the goodness of fit of applied models and determine which provides the best description of pistachio nut growth as a function of thermal unit accumulation. Three fruit growth traits of pistachio-pericarp hull endocarp shell size endocarp thickening and hardening and embryo kernel size-exhibited clear nonlinear dependence on heat accumulation. We tested three nonlinear models-Michaelis-Menten three-parameter logistic and Gompertz-fitted to fruit development data to create a tool to forecast pest susceptibility and harvest timing. Observation of development began at full bloom and ended at harvest. Data were collected from six pistachio cultivars in one experimental and eight commercial orchards over 3 years. Analyses of residual distribution parameter standard errors coefficient of determination R2 and the Akaike information criterion AIC all demonstrated the Gompertz function was the best model. Cultivars differed significantly in all the three parameters Asym b and c for all three traits with the Gompertz model demonstrating the Gompertz model can adjust to incorporate cultivar differences. The growth curve of the three traits together provided integrated information on nut biomass accumulation that facilitates predicting the critical timing for multiple orchard management practices.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structures of opsin in the ligand-free and the G-protein-interacting states showed two inter-helical openings between transmembrane TM helices TM1 and TM7 and between TM5 and TM6 near the extracellular side that were thought to serve as the retinal uptake and release gates. However it is unclear which opening is for 11-cis-retinal uptake or all-trans-retinal release although speculations have been proposed based on the structural features of opsin and retinal. In this work we simulated the exit process of all-trans-retinal from the ligand-free opsin structure by the classical molecular dynamics MD and random acceleration molecular dynamics RAMD. In the 64 ns classical MD simulation retinal remained in the receptor but moved significantly toward the TM5-TM6 opening and almost inserted into the opening after 50 ns. Complete exit was observed in 114 out of 160 RAMD trajectories with the TM5-TM6 opening being the predominant egress gate while egress from the TM1-TM7 opening was observed in only a few trajectories when relatively large acceleration was applied and large structural alteration of the protein resulted. These results suggest that photolyzed all-trans-retinal is likely released through the TM5-TM6 opening. Based on the unidirectional mechanism of retinal exchange suggested by experiment we speculate that the TM1-TM7 opening serves as the 11-cis-retinal uptake gate. The spatial occupancy maps of retinal computed from the 160 RAMD trajectories further indicated that retinal experienced significant interactions with the receptor during the exit process. The implications of these findings for disease mechanisms of rhodopsin mutants are discussed.",

Here we describe the methods used in our laboratory to characterize the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dbp5 is essential for the process of mRNA export in budding yeast and highly conserved orthologs can be found in all eukaryotes. Specifically we describe enzyme assays to measure the catalytic activity of Dbp5 in association with RNA and known binding partners as well as assays developed to measure the binding affinities and release kinetics of RNA and adenosine nucleotides from Dbp5. These assays have provided important information that has shaped our current models of Dbp5 function in mRNA export and should be useful for the characterization of other DEAD-box family members.",

    "abstract": "New productive niches can offer new commercial perspectives linked to donkeys products and human therapeutic or leisure applications. However no assessment for selection criteria has been carried out yet. First we assessed the animal inherent features and environmental factors that may potentially influence several cognitive processes in donkeys. Then we aimed at describing a practical methodology to quantify such cognitive processes seeking their inclusion in breeding and conservation programmes through a multifactorial linear model. Sixteen cognitive process-related traits were scored on a problem-solving test in a sample of 300 Andalusian donkeys for three consecutive years from 2013 to 2015. The linear model assessed the influence and interactions of four environmental factors sex as an animal-inherent factor age as a covariable and the interactions between these factors. Analyses of variance were performed with GLM procedure of SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 24.0 software to assess the relative importance of each factor. All traits were significantly P0.05 affected by all factors in the model except for sex that was not significant for some of the cognitive processes and stimulus which was not significant P0.05 for all of them except for the coping style related ones. The interaction between all factors within the model was non-significant P0.05 for almost all cognitive processes. The development of complex multifactorial models to study cognitive processes may counteract the inherent variability in behavior genetics and the estimation and prediction of related breeding parameters key for the implementation of successful conservation programmes in apparently functionally misplaced endangered breeds.",

    "abstract": "jatspIntroductionjatsp jatspRisk factors for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism CAT include tumor type stage at diagnosis age and patient comorbidities. In the general population raceethnicity has been identified as a risk factor for venous thromboembolism VTE with an increased risk of VTE in African Americans AA and a lower risk in AsiansPacific Islanders API and Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic Whites NHW after adjustment for confounders such as demographic characteristics and patient comorbidities. However the impact of raceethnicity on the incidence of CAT has not been as well-studied.jatsp jatspMethodsjatsp jatspWe performed an observational cohort study using data from the California Cancer Registry linked to the California Patient Discharge Dataset and Emergency Department Utilization database. We identified a cohort of patients of all ages with first primary diagnosis of the 13 most common cancers in California between 2005-2014 including breast prostate lung colorectal bladder uterine kidney pancreatic stomach ovarian and brain cancer Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma and followed them for a diagnosis of VTE using specific ICD-9-CM codes. The 12-month cumulative incidences of VTE pulmonary embolism PE alone PE lower extremity deep venous thrombosis LE DVT proximal LE DVT alone and isolated distal DVT iDDVT were determined by raceethnicity adjusted for the competing risk of death. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to determine the effect of raceethnicity on the risk of CAT adjusted for age sex cancer stage type of initial therapy surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy neighborhood socioeconomic status insurance type and comorbidities. Patients with VTE prior to cancer diagnosis were excluded.jatsp jatspResultsjatsp jatspA total of 736292 cancer patients were included in the analysis cohort of which 38431 5.2 developed CAT within 12 months of diagnosis. When comparing the overall cancer cohort to those that developed VTE AA 7.2 vs 10.5 and NHW 61.9 vs 64.3 appear to be over-represented and API 11.6 vs 7.6 under-represented in VTE cohort Figure 1.jatsp jatspThe greatest disparities in incidence by raceethnicity were seen in PE. AA had the highest and API had the lowest 12-month cumulative incidences for all cancer types except for brain cancer Figure 2. These racialethnic differences were also seen among cumulative incidences of proximal LE DVT. For iDDVT AA again had the highest cumulative incidence compared to the other racial groups among all cancer types except for myeloma. Racial differences were not as prominent when examining cumulative incidence of all VTE PEDVT.jatsp jatspIn adjusted multivariable models of overall CAT compared to NHW AA had the highest risk of CAT across all cancer types except for brain cancer and myeloma. API had significantly lower risk of CAT than NHW for all cancer types. When examining PE only in multivariable models AA had significantly higher risk of PE compared to NHW in all cancer types except for kidney stomach brain cancer and myeloma Hazard Ratio HR ranging from 1.36 to 2.09. API had significantly lower risk of PE in all cancer types except uterine kidney and ovarian cancer HR ranging from 0.45 to 0.87. Hispanics had lower risk of PE than NHW in breast prostate colorectal bladder pancreatic cancer and myeloma HR ranging from 0.64 to 0.87. Figure 3jatsp jatspConclusionjatsp jatspIn this large diverse population-based cohort of cancer patients raceethnicity was associated with risk of CAT even after adjusting for cancer stage type of treatment sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. Overall AA had a significantly higher incidence and API had a significantly lower incidence of CAT than NHW. These racialethnic differences were especially prominent when examining PE only and PE appears to be the main driver for the racial differences observed in overall rates of CAT. Current risk prediction models for CAT do not include raceethnicity as a parameter. Future studies might examine if incorporation of raceethnicity into risk prediction models for CAT may improve their predictive value as this may have important implications for thromboprophylaxis in this high-risk population.jatsp jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspWun Glycomimetics Inc.

    "abstract": "Our objective is to identify genes that influence the development of any phenotypes of type 2 diabetes T2D or kidney disease in obese animals. We use the reproductively isolated UC Davis fatty Zucker strain rat model in which the defective chromosome 4 leptin receptor LeprfaStefaSte results in fatty obesity. We previously produced a congenic strain with the distal half of chromosome 1 from the Brown Norway strain BN on a Zucker ZUC background BN.ZUC-D1Rat183-D1Rat90. Previously published studies in males showed that the BN congenic donor region protects from some phenotypes of renal dysfunction and T2D. We now expand our studies to include females and expand phenotyping to gene expression. We performed diabetes and kidney disease phenotyping in chow-fed females of the BN.ZUC-D1Rat183-D1Rat90 congenic strain to determine the specific characteristics of the UC Davis model. Fatty LeprfaStefaSte animals of both BN and ZUC genotype in the congenic donor region had prediabetic levels of fasting blood glucose and blood glucose 2 hours after a glucose tolerance test. We observed significant congenic strain chromosome 1 genotype effects of the BN donor region in fatty females that resulted in decreased food intake urine volume glucose area under the curve during glucose tolerance test plasma triglyceride levels and urine glucose excretion per day. In fatty females there were significant congenic strain BN genotype effects on non-fasted plasma urea nitrogen triglyceride and creatinine. Congenic region genotype effects were observed by quantitative PCR of mRNA from the kidney for six genes all located in the chromosome 1 BN donor region with potential effects on T2D or kidney function. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the BN genotype chromosome 1 congenic region influences traits of both type 2 diabetes and kidney function in fatty UC Davis ZUC females and that there are many positional candidate genes.",

We evaluate the hypothesis that this asymmetry results from the distribution of abundance among species so that species interactions occur randomly among individuals. We used a database on mutualistic and antagonistic bipartite quantitative interaction networks. We show that across all types of networks asymmetry was correlated with abundance so that rare species were asymmetrically affected by their abundant partners while pairs of interacting abundant species tended to exhibit more symmetric reciprocally strong effects. A null model shows that abundance provides a sufficient explanation of the asymmetry structure in some networks but suggests the role of additional factors in others. Although not universal our hypothesis holds for a substantial fraction of networks analyzed here and should be considered as a null model in all studies aimed at evaluating the ecological and evolutionary consequences of species interactions.

Two popular measures of such efficiency of a basis are sparsity measured by the expected p norm 0 p 1 and statistical independence measured by the mutual information. Gaining deeper understanding of their intricate relationship however remains elusive. Therefore we choose to study a simple synthetic stochastic process called the spike process which puts a unit impulse at a random location in an otherwise zero vector of length n in each realization. For this process we prove the following results 1 The standard basis is the best in terms of sparsity for all n 2 among all possible orthonormal bases in R n or all possible invertible linear transformations in R n with a fixed determinant value 2 The standard basis is again the best in terms of statistical independence if n 5 and the search of basis is restricted within all possible orthonormal bases in R n if 2 n 4 then the standard basis is not the best orthonormal basis in statistical independence 3 If we extend our basis search to all possible linear invertible transformations in R n then the best basis in statistical independence is not the standard basis for any n 2 4 The best basis in statistical independence is not unique in general and there even exist those which turn input spikes into completely dense vectors 5 There is no linear invertible transformation that achieves the true statistical independence for n 2. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "Maize Zea mays L. is a highly valuable crop in Argentina frequently contaminated with the mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus. Biocontrol products formulated with atoxigenic nontoxic strains of this fungal species are well known as an effective method to reduce this contamination. In the present study 83 A. flavus isolates from two maize regions of Argentina were characterized and evaluated for their ability to produce or lack of producing mycotoxins in order to select atoxigenic strains to be used as potential biocontrol agents BCA. All of the isolates were tested for aflatoxin and cyclopiazonic acid CPA production in maize kernels and a liquid culture medium. Genetic diversity of the nonaflatoxigenic isolates was evaluated by analysis of vegetative compatibility groups VCG and confirmation of deletions in the aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster. Eight atoxigenic isolates were compared for their ability to reduce aflatoxin and CPA contamination in maize kernels in coinoculation tests. The A. flavus population was composed of 32 aflatoxin and CPA producers and 52 CPA producers and 16 was determined as atoxigenic. All of the aflatoxin producer isolates also produced CPA. Aflatoxin and CPA production was significantly higher in maize kernels than in liquid medium. The 57 nonaflatoxigenic strains formed six VCG with AM1 and AM5 being the dominant groups with a frequency of 58 and 35 respectively. In coinoculation experiments all of the atoxigenic strains reduced aflatoxin from 54 to 83 and CPA from 60 to 97. Members of group AM1 showed a greater aflatoxin reduction than members of AM5 72 versus 66 but no differences were detected in CPA production. Here we described for the first time atoxigenic isolates of A. flavus that show promise to be used as BCA in maize crops in Argentina. This innovating biological control approach should be considered developed further and used by the maize industry to preserve the quality properties and food safety of maize kernels in Argentina.",

Monopropionin monovalerin monolaurin and sodium formate were tested at 10 to 12 concentrations from 0.001 to 2.50 mgL monobutyrin was tested at 16 concentrations from 0.001 to 5.00 mgL butyric acid and valeric acid were tested at 8 concentrations from 0.001 to 0.35 mgL while formic acid was tested at 8 concentrations from 0.001 to 1.00 mgL. The tested bacteria included G- bacteria Escherichia coli Salmonella typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni and G bacteria Enterococcus faecalis Clostridia perfringens Streptococcus pneumonia and Streptococcus suis. Antimicrobial activity of tested compounds was expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration MIC that prevented growth of tested bacteria in treated culture broth. Butyric acid valeric acid and formic acid at highest tested concentrations inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. The MICs of the three acids varied among bacterial strains with lowest MIC of 0.050.10 mgL on two strains of Campylobacter. Sodium formate at highest tested concentrations did not inhibit the growth of E. coli S. typhimurium and E. faecalis but the compound inhibited the growth of other tested bacteria with MIC values from 0.20 to 1.88 mgL. The MIC values of monovalerin monolaurin and monobutyrin ranged between 0.001 and 1.50 mgL on all bacterial strains with the exception that monobutyrin did not inhibit C. jejuni ATCC 33560 growth at the highest concentration tested 5.0 mgL. Monopropionin at tested concentrations did not inhibit the growth of all tested bacteria with the exception of 1.13 mgL as MIC on C. perfringens ATCC 12915. The MIC tests indicate that all organic acids and their derivatives except monopropionin tested in this experiment exhibited strong antimicrobial effects in vitro against tested bacterial strains.jatsp",

Both conditions exist in sickle cell disease SCD. We used a population-based epidemiological approach to determine the incidence of hematological malignancy in patients with SCD.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleMethodsjatstitle jatspThe California CA Office of Statewide Healthcare Planning and Development OSHPD operates a Patient Discharge Dataset PDD and Emergency Department Utilization EDU dataset that records the discharge diagnoses and procedures for all non-federal hospitalizations or ED visits in CA. Cases coded as SCD 282.60 282.61 282.62 282.63 282.68 282.69 282.41 282.42 from 19912007 PDD or 20052007 EDU were found. Cases were excluded if the SCD code did not appear in the principal position and appeared in the secondary diagnosis position only once or age lt 2 years lacked social security number for linkage. These cases were then linked to the California Cancer Registry CCR to determine cases with leukemia myeloma or lymphoma including Hodgkin. Standardized incidence ratios SIR were calculated. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the effect of doubling the CA SCD population on SIR.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleResultsjatstitle jatspThere were 46 total cases of hematological malignancies identified 25 females and 21 males. Fifty nine percent of the SCD patients with hematological malignancies were ages 3059 years. The cohort was 78 Black 11 White 7 Hispanic and 4 Asian.jatsp jatspThe remaining cases had chronic myelogenous leukemia n4 and other leukemia not otherwise specified n5. Limiting analysis to only Non-Hispanic Blacks did not appreciably change the SIR estimates. Even if the SCD population was underestimated by half sensitivity analysis showed the observed cases would yield an SIR for all hematopoietic malignancies of 19 95 CI 1425. The individual sub-type SIR would also still range from 1324 and all would be statistically significant.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleConclusionsjatstitle jatspThe CA SCD cohort had elevated SIR for hematological malignancies suggesting higher incidence in this population. Limitations include those inherent in query of any large administrative dataset. However our SCD population estimate is consistent with that of others and the CCR has validated robust tumor data. Current efforts to develop a US registry for SCD patients should include tracking for hematological and perhaps all malignancies. Further studies using independent datasets are important to confirm these provocative findings.jatsp jatssec jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspWun Glycomimetics Inc.

Current probes around the Milky Way MW are most sensitive to such substructure within 20 kpc of the halo centre where the galaxy contributes significantly to the potential.We explore the effects of baryons on subhalo populations in CDM using cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations of MW-mass haloes from the Latte simulation suite part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments FIRE project. Specifically we compare simulations of the same two haloes run using 1 DM-only DMO 2 full baryonic physics and 3 DM with an embedded disc potential grown to match the FIRE simulation. Relative to baryonic simulations DMO simulations contain 2 as many subhaloes within 100 kpc of the halo centre this excess is 5 within 25 kpc. At z 0 the baryonic simulations are completely devoid of subhaloes down to 3 106M within 15 kpc of the MW-mass galaxy and fewer than 20 surviving subhaloes have orbital pericentres 20 kpc. Despite the complexities of baryonic physics the simple addition of an embedded central disc potential to DMO simulations reproduces this subhalo depletion including trends with radius remarkably well. Thus the additional tidal field from the central galaxy is the primary cause of subhalo depletion. Subhaloes on radial orbits that pass close to the central galaxy are preferentially destroyed causing the surviving population to have tangentially biased orbits compared to DMO predictions. Our method of embedding a potential in DMO simulations provides a fast and accurate alternative to full baryonic simulations thus enabling suites of cosmological simulations that can provide accurate and statistical predictions of substructure populations.",

These assumptions led to closed form solutions for both molality and solute activity as a function of water activity. Concentration-activity data of a wide range of solutes were accurately fit by the model. In this work we advance the model by a using statistical mechanics to derive the Gibbs free energy of the solute-water system and b applying the model to data for a number of sugars. The results show that the number of water molecules hydrogen bonded to the sugars is equal to the number of oxygen atoms in the sugar and that one free energy value presumably the net hydrogen bond free energy fits the concentration-activity data pretty well. The model also predicts the number of water molecules bound to the solute and the number of water molecules that are free. Hydration number as a function of water activity from the literature were compared to model predictions finding remarkable agreement.",

We propose a Lyapunov-based predictive control design that guarantees stabilization and state and input constraint satisfaction for all times from an explicitly characterized set of initial conditions. An auxiliary Lyapunov-based analytical bounded control design is used to characterize the stability region of the predictive controller and also provide a feasible initial guess to the optimization problem in the predictive controller formulation. For the case when the state constraints are soft we propose a switched predictive control strategy that reduces the time during which state constraints are violated driving the states into the state and input constraints feasibility region of the Lyapunov-based predictive controller. We demonstrate the application of the Lyapunov-based predictive controller designs through a chemical process example. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

All patients reported to date carry the N88K mutation suggesting a possible common founder effect. To decrease the likelihood of a recombination event occurring within the span of neighboring microsatellite markers we used seven intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs spanning 8 kb to characterize the haplotype associated with N88K. In three affected N88K homozygous individuals we identified a common haplotype present in all heterozygous carriers of N88K. Of note in two asymptomatic N88K homozygous individuals a second haplotype was present that differed at three SNP sites downstream from the N88K mutation. Our findings of a common haplotype associated with the N88K mutation support a founder effect. The discordant haplotype found in homozygous individuals suggests that recombination events may have occurred within the rapsyn gene and that this may have implications in the phenotypic expression of the disease.",

We used simian immunodeficiency virus SIV-infected rhesus macaques as an animal model for HIV to determine pathogenic effects of SIV on intestinal T lymphocytes. Intestinal CD4 T-cell depletion and the potential for cytokine responses were examined during SIV infection and compared with results for lymphocytes from lymph nodes and blood. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated severe depletion of CD4CD8- single-positive T cells and CD4CD8 double-positive T cells in intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes LPL and intraepithelial lymphocytes IEL during primary SIV infection which persisted through the entire course of SIV infection. In contrast CD4 T-cell depletion was gradual in peripheral lymph nodes and blood. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular gamma interferon IFN-gamma and interleukin-4 IL-4 production following short-term mitogenic activation revealed that LPL retained same or higher capacity for IFN-gamma production in all stages of SIV infection compared to uninfected controls whereas peripheral blood mononuclear cells displayed a gradual decline. The CD8 T cells were the major producers of IFN-gamma. There was no detectable change in the frequency of IL-4-producing cells in both LPL and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus severe depletion of CD4 LPL and IEL in primary SIV infection accompanied by altered cytokine responses may reflect altered T-cell homeostasis in intestinal mucosa. This could be a mechanism of SIV-associated enteropathy and viral pathogenesis. Dynamic changes in intestinal T lymphocytes were not adequately represented in peripheral lymph nodes or blood.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma can be challenging and resource intensive. Observation with serial clinical assessments plays a major role in the evaluation of these patients but the time required for intra-abdominal injury to become clinically apparent is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of time required for an intra-abdominal injury to become clinically apparent after blunt abdominal trauma via physical examination or commonly followed clinical values. METHODS A retrospective review of patients who sustained blunt trauma resulting in intra-abdominal injury between June 2010 and June 2012 at a Level 1 academic trauma center was performed. Patient demographics injuries and the amount of time from emergency department admission to sign or symptom development and subsequent diagnosis were recorded. All diagnoses were made by computed tomography or at the time of surgery. Patient transfers from other hospitals were excluded. RESULTS Of 3574 blunt trauma patients admitted to the hospital 285 8 experienced intra-abdominal injuries. The mean SD age was 36 17 years the majority were male 194 patients 68 and the mean SD Injury Severity Score ISS was 21 14. The mean SD time from admission to diagnosis via computed tomography or surgery was 74 55 minutes. Eighty patients 28 required either surgery 78 patients 17 or radiographic embolization 2 patients 0.7 for their injury. All patients who required intervention demonstrated a sign or symptom of their intra-abdominal injury within 60 minutes of arrival although two patients were intervened upon in a delayed fashion. All patients with a blunt intra-abdominal injury manifested a clinical sign or symptom of their intra-abdominal injury resulting in their diagnosis within 8 hours 25 minutes of arrival to the hospital. CONCLUSION All diagnosed intra-abdominal injuries from blunt trauma manifested clinical signs or symptoms that could prompt imaging or intervention leading to their diagnosis within 8 hours 25 minutes of arrival to the hospital. All patients who required an intervention for their injury manifested a sign or symptom of their injury within 60 minutes of arrival. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic study level IV. Epidemiologic study level III.",

DESIGN Evaluation study. SAMPLE 114 recipes obtained from books and online sources for HPMDs for cats. PROCEDURES Computer software was used to determine nutrient concentrations of HPMD recipes for comparison with NRC RAs for essential nutrients for adult cats. Effects of recipe authorship veterinarian vs nonveterinarian and supplementation on the number of nutrient concentrations below RAs were evaluated. RESULTS Of the 114 HPMD recipes 113 contained vague instructions regarding preparation and 46 did not provide feeding directions. Only 94 recipes provided adequately detailed information for computerized nutritional analysis although most 9394 still required assumptions regarding ingredients preparation or supplementation. Nonveterinarian-authored recipes and recipes without supplement-type products had more nutrient concentrations below NRC RAs but no recipe met all RAs. With assumptions 5 veterinarian-authored recipes met NRC RAs for all assessed nutrients except choline however taurine adequacy in 2 of those recipes could not be confirmed. Crude protein concentration was below the RA in 6 of 94 6.4 recipes. Nutrients most frequently below RAs included choline iron thiamine zinc manganese vitamin E and copper in 89.7 76.6 62.8 61.7 57.4 57.4 and 45.7 of recipes respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Problems with nutritional adequacy were identified in all evaluated HPMD recipes. Appropriate formulation of HPMDs requires specialized knowledge of nutrition and use of computer software to avoid potentially harmful nutrient deficiencies.",

The proposed architecture Hierarchical Lightwave Optical Interconnect Network H-LION leverages wavelength routing in arrayed waveguide grating routers AWGRs and computing nodes or servers with embedded routers and wavelength-specific optical IOs. Within the racks and clusters the interconnect topology is hierarchical all-to-all exploiting passive AWGRs. For the intercluster communication the proposed architecture exploits a flat and distributed Thin-CLOS topology based on AWGR-based optical switches. H-LION can scale beyond 100 000 nodes while guaranteeing up to 1.83saving in number of inter-rack cables and up to 1.5saving in number of inter-rack switches when compared with a legacy three-tier Fat Tree network. Network simulation results show a system-wide network throughput reaching as high as 90 of the total possible capacity in case of synthetic traffic with uniform random distribution. Experiments show 97 intracluster throughput for uniform random traffic and error-free intercluster communication at 10 Gbs.",

The mother and sons gain eternal life merger through their submission to the violent human king an earthly father figure. Unlike animal sacrifice which completely excluded women the willingness to sacrifice ones life via martyrdom gives women an odd sense of agency. The mother plays a major role but it is the role of giving away motherhood while instantiating the idealized object of the divine father. Martyrdom fulfills the same unconscious role as animal sacrifice displacing the human mother in favor of a divine father and in this case a father who offers eternal life. 2006 APA all rights reserved.",

Folding events have been observed in multiple trajectories and the best folded structures achieved root-mean-square deviation RMSD of 2.0 A. The folding of this three-helix bundle protein followed a diffusion-collision process where substantial formation of the individual helices was critical and preceded the global packing. Owing to the difference in the intrinsic helicity helix I formed faster than the other two helices. The order of the formation of helices II and III varied in different trajectories indicating heterogeneity of the folding process. The slightly shifted boundaries of the helical segments had direct impact on the global packing suggesting room for improvement on the simulation force field and solvation model.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To describe the first series of six young uveal melanoma UM patients with oral isotretinoin andor topical retinoid therapy prior to diagnosis. OBSERVATIONS The case series is based on clinical observations at our UM quaternary referral center. Six UM patient cases are reported ages 16-44 years old. All had been using either oral isotretinoin andor topical tretinoin or tazarotene retinoid treatment 3 months-10 years prior to or at the time of diagnosis 3 of 6 cases. All patients had ocular complaints on presentation and the onset of certain symptoms corresponded with the course of retinoids. Other potential risk factors or relevant history included Caucasian background cone-rod dystrophy and active smoker status Case 2 family history of UM and pregnancy at time of diagnosis Case 3 past smoking and possible secondary Chernobyl exposure as a baby Case 5. All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy and currently have no sign of recurrent or metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE Retinoid therapy has been linked to various benign andor reversible effects on the anterior and posterior eye though pathophysiology remains not well understood. Uveal melanoma UM is a rare cancer diagnosis in young adults. We report here the first case series of young UM patients with a history of retinoid use and ocular complaints. No causal link is claimed and further systematic epidemiologic and biologic study of retinoid therapy and ocular impact may provide additional relevant data particularly in young ocular melanoma patients.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that dietary krill oil leads to higher omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3 PUFA tissue accretion compared to fish oil because the former is rich in n-3 PUFA esterified as phospholipids PL while n-3 PUFA in fish oil are primarily esterified as triacylglycerols TAG. Tissue accretion of the same dietary concentrations of PL- and TAG-docosahexaenoic acid 226n-3 DHA has not been compared and was the focus of this study. Mice n 12group were fed either a control diet or one of six DHA 1 2 or 4 as PL-DHA or TAG-DHA diets for 4 weeks. Compared with the control DHA concentration in liver adipose tissue AT heart and eye but not brain were significantly higher in mice consuming either PL- or TAG-DHA but there was no difference in DHA concentration in all tissues between the PL- or TAG-DHA forms. Consumption of PL- and TAG-DHA at all concentrations significantly elevated eicosapentaenoic acid 205n-3 EPA in all tissues when compared with the control group while docoshexapentaenoic acid 225n-6 DPA was significantly higher in all tissues except for the eye and heart. Both DHA forms lowered total omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6 PUFA in all tissues and total monounsaturated fatty acids MUFA in the liver and AT total saturated fatty acid SFA were lowered in the liver but elevated in the AT. An increase in the DHA dose independent of DHA forms significantly lowered n-6 PUFA and significantly elevated n-3 PUFA concentration in all tissues. Our results do not support the claim that the PL form of n-3 PUFA leads to higher n-3 PUFA tissue accretion than their TAG form.",

    "abstract": "One of the most celebrated examples of sympatric speciation in nature are monophyletic radiations of cichlid fishes endemic to Cameroon crater lakes. However phylogenetic inference of monophyly may not detect complex colonization histories involving some allopatric isolation such as double invasions obscured by genome-wide gene flow. Population genomic approaches are better suited to test hypotheses of sympatric speciation in these cases. Here we use comprehensive sampling from all four sympatric crater lake cichlid radiations in Cameroon and outgroups across Africa combined with next-generation sequencing to genotype tens of thousands of SNPs. We find considerable evidence of gene flow between all four radiations and neighboring riverine populations after initial colonization. In a few cases some sympatric species are more closely related to outgroups than others consistent with secondary gene flow facilitating their speciation. Our results do not rule out sympatric speciation in Cameroon cichlids but rather reveal a complex history of speciation with gene flow including allopatric and sympatric phases resulting in both reproductively isolated species and incipient species complexes. The best remaining non-cichlid examples of sympatric speciation all involve assortative mating within microhabitats. We speculate that this feature may be necessary to complete the process of sympatric speciation in nature.",

    "abstract": "We propose the first unified objective framework SyCLoPS for detecting and classifying all types of low-pressure systems LPSs in a given data set. We use the state-of-the-art automated feature tracking software TempestExtremes TE to detect and track LPS features globally in ERA5 and compute 16 parameters from commonly found atmospheric variables for classification. A Python classifier is implemented to classify all LPSs at once. The framework assigns 16 different labels classes to each LPS data point and designates four different types of high-impact LPS tracks including tracks of tropical cyclone TC monsoonal system subtropical storm and polar low. The classification process involves disentangling high-altitude and drier LPSs differentiating tropical and non-tropical LPSs using novel criteria and optimizing for the detection of the four types of high-impact LPS. A comparison of our labels with those in the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship IBTrACS revealed an overall accuracy of 95 in distinguishing between tropical systems extratropical cyclones and disturbances. SyCLoPS produces a better TC detection skill compared to the previous algorithms highlighted by an approximately 6 reduction in the false alarm rate compared to the previous TE algorithm. The vertical cross section composite of the four types of high-impact LPS we detect each shows distinct structural characteristics. Finally we demonstrate that SyCLoPS is valuable for investigating various aspects of LPSs in climate data such as the evolution of a single LPS track patterns of LPS frequencies and precipitation or wind influence associated with a particular LPS class.",

    "abstract": "With the goal of developing a total-body small-animal PET system with a high spatial resolution of 0.5 mm and a high sensitivity 10 for mouserat studies we simulated four scanners using the graphical processing unit-based Monte Carlo simulation package gPET and compared their performance in terms of spatial resolution and sensitivity. We also investigated the effect of depth-of-interaction DOI resolution on the spatial resolution. All the scanners are built upon 128 DOI encoding dual-ended readout detectors with lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate LYSO arrays arranged in 8 detector rings. The solid angle coverages of the four scanners are all 0.85 steradians. Each LYSO element has a cross-section of 0.44 0.44 mm2 and the pitch size of the LYSO arrays are all 0.5 mm. The four scanners can be divided into two groups 1 H2RS110-C10 and H2RS110-C20 with 40 40 LYSO arrays a ring diameter of 110 mm and axial length of 167 mm and 2 H2RS160-C10 and H2RS160-C20 with 60 60 LYSO arrays a diameter of 160 mm and axial length of 254 mm. C10 and C20 denote the crystal thickness of 10 and 20 mm respectively. The simulation results show that all scanners have a spatial resolution better than 0.5 mm at the center of the field-of-view FOV. The radial resolution strongly depends on the DOI resolution and radial offset but not the axial resolution and tangential resolution. Comparing the C10 and C20 designs the former provides better resolution especially at positions away from the center of the FOV whereas the latter has 2 higher sensitivity 10 versus 20. This simulation study provides evidence that the 110 mm systems are a good choice for total-body mouse studies at a lower cost whereas the 160 mm systems are suited for both total-body mouse and rat studies.",

SAMPLE POPULATION 54 isolates of C pseudotuberculosis from 49 horses 4 cattle and 1 sheep. PROCEDURES Random amplified polymorphic DNA RAPD polymerase chain reaction PCR assay PCR assay for the gene encoding the phospholipase D PLD toxin biochemical analyses and tests for susceptibility to 17 antimicrobial drugs were performed. RESULTS All isolates reduced nitrate to nitrite most yielded positive results for the PLD toxin gene and all were susceptible to antimicrobial drugs. Ten genetic types were detected by use of RAPD PCR assay types III to X were isolated from horses cattle or both in 1 or more states. Types III and IX were isolated from both horses and cattle. Types VII and VIII were isolated in only 1 state but the number of isolates in these groups was small. In contrast all other types were isolated in 2 or more states. All isolates from Utah were type III but the other 3 states had isolates from more than 1 type. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE These data are consistent with a clonally expanding epidemic of infection in Utah and an increase in number of infections caused by multiple strains of C pseudotuberculosis not derived from a single source in the other states. The increase in number of infections could be the result of reporting bias environmental factors facilitating infection or host factors such as greater herd susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study was undertaken to determine the short-term and longer term impact of sociodemographic disadvantage on the emotional-behavioral status of youths with new onset epilepsy and their unaffected siblings at the time of diagnosis and the subsequent 3 years. METHODS Three hundred twelve youths with newly diagnosed epilepsies and 223 unaffected siblings aged 6-16 years were independently assessed regarding their emotional and behavioral status by their parents and teachers at baseline and at 18 at 36 months later youths with seizures also completed self-report measures of depression anxiety and hostility at those three time points. A sociodemographic disadvantage score was computed for each family children with newly diagnosed seizures and their siblings and families were separated into four categories from most disadvantaged to least disadvantaged. RESULTS In both children and siblings the least disadvantaged group exhibited the lowest level of neurobehavioral problems whereas the most disadvantaged group showed a higher level of neurobehavioral problems across all the same behavior metrics. Findings remained stable and significant across all informants parent teacher child and across all time periods throughout the 3-year period. Furthermore both corrected and uncorrected linear regression analyses indicated that disadvantage was a more constant and stable predictor of behavioral and emotional problems over time compared to clinical seizure characteristics and abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalographic testing. SIGNIFICANCE Sociodemographic disadvantage bears a strong relationship to youths with emotional and behavioral problems both at the time of diagnosis as well as prospectively. The relationship is robust and reflected in reports from multiple informants parent teacher child self-report evident in siblings as well and possibly more explanatory than traditional clinical seizure variables. Future studies will be needed to determine whether this disadvantage factor is modifiable with early intervention.",

    "abstract": "Reducing population exposure to PM2.5 in the eastern US will require control of secondary sulfate and nitrate. A source-oriented Community Multi-scale Air Quality CMAQ model is used to determine contributions of major emission sources to nitrate and sulfate concentrations in the seven eastern US cities New York City Pittsburgh Baltimore Chicago Detroit St. Paul and Winston-Salem in January and August of 2000 and 2006. Identified major nitrate sources include on-road gasoline-powered vehicles diesel engines natural gas and coal combustion. From 2000 to 2006 January nitrate concentrations decreased by 25-68 for all the seven cities. On average 53 of this change was caused by emissions controls while 47 was caused by meteorology variations. August nitrate concentrations decreased by a maximum of 68 in New York City but Detroit experienced increasing August nitrate concentrations by up to 33. On average 33 of the reduction in nitrate is offset by increases associated with meteorological conditions that favor nitrate formation. Coal combustion and natural gas are the dominant sources for sulfate in both seasons. January sulfate decrease from 2000 to 2006 in all cities by 4-58 except New York City which increases by 13. On average 93 of the reduction in sulfate was attributed to emission controls with 7 associated with changes in meteorology. August sulfate concentrations decrease by 11-44 in all cities. On average emission controls alone between 2000 and 2006 would have caused 6 more reduction but the effectiveness of the controls was mitigated by meteorology conditions more favorable to sulfate production in 2006 vs. 2000. The results of this study suggest that regional emissions controls between 2000 and 2006 have been effective at reducing population exposure to PM2.5 in the eastern US but yearly variations in meteorology must be carefully considered when assessing the exact magnitude of the control benefits.",

    "abstract": "The major rice quantitative-trait locus Submergence 1 Sub1 confers tolerance of submergence for about 2 weeks. To identify novel sources of tolerance we have conducted a germplasm survey with allele-specific markers targeting SUB1A and SUB1C two of the three transcription-factor genes within the Sub1 locus. The objective was to identify tolerant genotypes without the SUB1A gene or with the intolerant SUB1A-2 allele. The survey revealed that all tolerant genotypes possessed the tolerant Sub1 haplotype SUB1A-1SUB1C-1 whereas all accessions without the SUB1A gene were intolerant. Only the variety James Wee with the SUB1A-2 allele was moderately tolerant. However some intolerant genotypes with the SUB1A-1 allele were identified and RT-PCR analyses were conducted to compare gene expression in tolerant and intolerant accessions. Initial analyses of leaf samples failed to reveal a clear association of SUB1A transcript abundance and tolerance. Temporal and spatial gene expression analyses subsequently showed that SUB1A expression in nodes and internodes associated best with tolerance across representative genotypes. In James Wee transcript abundance was high in all tissues suggesting that some level of tolerance might be conferred by high expression of the SUB1A-2 allele. To further assess tissue-specific expression we have expressed the GUS reporter gene under the control of the SUB1A-1 promoter. The data revealed highly specific GUS expression at the base of the leaf sheath and in the leaf collar region. Specific expression in the growing part of rice leaves is well in agreement with the role of SUB1A in suppressing leaf elongation under submergence.",

    "abstract": "Viruses replicate their genomes using a variety of mechanisms leading to different distributions of mutations among their progeny. Yet models of viral evolution often only consider the mean mutation rate. To investigate when and how replication mechanisms impact viral evolution we analyze the early dynamics of within-host infection for two idealized cases when all offspring virions from an infected cell carry the same genotype mutated or not and when mutations occur independently across offspring virions. Other replication life histories fall between these extremes. Using branching process models we study the probability that viral infection becomes established when mutations are lethal and in the more general case of two strains of different fitness. For a given mean mutation rate we show that a lineage of viruses with correlated mutations is less likely to survive than with independent mutations but when it survives the viral population grows faster. While this holds true for all parameter regimes replication life history has a quantitatively significant influence on viral dynamics when stochastic effects are important and when mutations are crucial for survival-conditions typical of evolutionary escape situations.",

In this population-based evaluation of AYA ALL patients across the United States US we sought to describe recent patterns of care and outcomes regarding HCT in first complete remission CR1 amongst AYAs with ALL.jatsp jatspMethodsjatsp jatspData were abstracted from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER Patterns of Care POC study focused on AYA cancers. AYAs 15-39 years with ALL newly diagnosed between January 1 2012 through December 31 2013 and registered in the SEER program were included. Allogeneic HCT in CR1 was defined as occurrence of HCT without relapseprogression prior to the HCT date HCT was considered a time-dependent variable in survival models. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with HCT in CR1 cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate associations with survival.jatsp jatspResultsjatsp jatspThree-hundred and ninety-nine AYAs 15-39 years with newly diagnosed ALL between 2012-2013 were included median follow-up for survival was 19 months range 0-35 months. The median age was 24 years 85 had B-cell ALL 27 had high risk ALL cytogenetics. One-third of AYA ALL patients received care from pediatric oncologists while two-thirds were treated by adult hematologistoncologists a majority 86 received care at a teaching hospital. Fifty-eight percent received an asparaginase-containing ALL front-line regimen 32 received hyperCVAD 5.9 and 4.5 received anotherunknown regimens respectively. One-hundred and two 29 AYAs underwent allogeneic HCT in CR1.

Facing Your Fears in Schools FYF-S is a manualized group CBT intervention to manage anxiety in autistic students and can be delivered by interdisciplinary school providers ISPs. Training mental health MH and non-mental health non-MH providers to deliver FYF-S may increase the capacity to meet the mental health needs of autistic students. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were differences in knowledge and perceptions among MH versus non-MH providers. Seventy-seven ISPs participated in a FYF-S training. CBT knowledge was measured pre- and post-training readiness to deliver FYF-S was measured post-training. ISPs delivered FYF-S to 39 students with autism or suspected autism and anxiety. Post-intervention ISPs rated program acceptability appropriateness and feasibility. Although there were significant differences in CBT knowledge pre-training MH and non-MH providers showed significant improvements in CBT knowledge post-training. Providers did not significantly differ in knowledge nor readiness to deliver FYF-S. Post-intervention MH and non-MH providers did not demonstrate significant differences in program acceptability appropriateness or feasibility. Preliminary qualitative comparison of intervention groups with a MH provider and those led by non-MH providers did not reveal differences in FYF-S fidelity or student anxiety outcomes. This study provides encouraging evidence that training ISPs to deliver a manualized CBT intervention may be a promising approach to increasing access to much-needed MH services for autistic youth.",

Most research regarding hormones and neurogenesis has been performed on non-primate species. To determine whether gonadal hormones can modulate endogenous neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus DG of the hippocampus in non-human primates ovariectomized OVX female rhesus monkeys received continuous unopposed beta-estradiol OVX-E-Con cyclic unopposed beta-estradiol OVX-E-Cyc continuous beta-estradiolcyclic progesterone OVX-E-ConP-Cyc or control OVX-Veh treatments. At week 29 all monkeys received BrdU injections for 4 consecutive days in addition to the ongoing treatment. Twenty days after the last BrdU injection all animals were sacrificed for tissue collection. In DG of hippocampus scattered BrdU-ir cells were observed mainly in the subgranular zone SGZ and in the granule cell layer and occasionally these BrdU-ir cells in the SGZ formed clusters containing between 2 and 5 cells. In the granule cell layer and SGZ virtually none of the BrdU-ir cells were either Dcx a marker of immature neurons or GFAP positive. However an occasional BrdU-ir cell was positive for both neuronal marker NeuN or beta III-tubulin. Unbiased stereological analysis of BrdU-ir cells within the SGZ and the granule cell layer of DG revealed that among the experimental groups there was no significant difference in number of BrdU-ir cells within the SGZ and the granule cell layer of the DG OVX-E-Con 1801-218.7 OVX-E-Cyc 1783-415.6 OVX-E-Con-P-Cyc 1721-229.6 and OVX-Veh 1263-106.3 but a trend towards increased BrdU-ir cells was observed in all the experimental groups.",

    "abstract": "The study of the holotype and of a new specimen of Nanchangosaurus suni Reptilia Diapsida Hupehsuchia revealed a suite of hitherto unrecognized characters. For example Nanchangosaurus has bipartite neural spines and its vertebral count is nearly identical to that of Hupehsuchus. It differs from the latter in having poorly developed forelimbs despite the advanced ossification in the rest of the skeleton. Other differences all pertain to hupehsuchian plesiomorphies retained in Nanchangosaurus such as low neural spines. The relationship of Hupehsuchia within Diapsida was analyzed based on a data matrix containing 41 taxa coded for 213 characters of which 18 were identified as aquatic adaptations from functional inferences. These aquatic adaptations may be vulnerable to the argumentation of character homology because expectation for homoplasy is high. There is an apparent incongruence between phylogenetic signals from aquatic adaptations and the rest of the data with aquatic adaptations favoring all marine reptiles but Helveticosaurus to form a super-clade. However this super-clade does not obtain when aquatic adaptations were deleted whereas individual marine reptile clades are all derived without them. We examined all possible combinations of the 18 aquatic adaptations n 262143 and found that four lineages of marine reptiles are recognized almost regardless of which of these features were included in the analysis Hupehsuchia-Ichthyopterygia clade Sauropterygia-Saurosphargidae clade Thalattosauria and Helveticosaurus. The interrelationships among these four depended on the combination of aquatic adaptations to be included i.e. assumed to be homologous a priori by bypassing character argumentation. Hupehsuchia always appeared as the sister taxon of Ichthyopterygia.",

    "abstract": "Allantoin is the end product of purine catabolism in all mammals except humans great apes and one breed of dog the Dalmatian. Humans and Dalmatian dogs produce uric acid during purine degradation which leads to elevated levels of uric acid in blood and urine and can result in significant diseases in both species. The defect in Dalmatians results from inefficient transport of uric acid in both the liver and renal proximal tubules. Hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia huu is a simple autosomal recessive trait for which all Dalmatian dogs are homozygous. Therefore in order to map the locus an interbreed backcross was used. Linkage mapping localized the huu trait to CFA03 which excluded the obvious urate transporter 1 gene SLC22A12. Positional cloning placed the locus in a minimal interval of 2.5 Mb with a LOD score of 17.45. A critical interval of 333 kb containing only four genes was homozygous in all Dalmatians. Sequence and expression analyses of the SLC2A9 gene indicated three possible mutations a missense mutation G616TC188F and two promoter mutations that together appear to reduce the expression levels of one of the isoforms. The missense mutation is associated with hyperuricosuria in the Dalmatian while the promoter SNPs occur in other unaffected breeds of dog. Verification of the causative nature of these changes was obtained when hyperuricosuric dogs from several other breeds were found to possess the same combination of mutations as found in the Dalmatian. The Dalmatian dog model of hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia underscores the importance of SLC2A9 for uric acid transport in mammals.",

The presence of ESBL ACBL and PMQR genes were detected using a single novel multiplex qPCR. Only the genes bla CMY-2 and bla TEM were detected in the 110 Salmonella isolates tested. PMQR genes were not detected in isolates screened. Of 94 third-generation cephalosporin resistant isolates representing eight serotypes 48 n 45 were positive for bla CMY-2 only and 50 n 47 were simultaneously positive for bla CMY-2 and bla TEM. Two third-generation cephalosporin resistant isolates were tested negative for all -lactamase genes in our qPCR assay and likely house ESBL genes not screened for by our qPCR assay. A logistic regression model revealed that for serotype Dublin isolates n 38 the odds ratio for testing positive for bla TEM when compared to all other serotypes was 51.6 95 CI 4.01-664.03 p 0.0029. For serotype Typhimurium n 9 the odds ratio for testing positive for bla TEM when compared to all other serotypes was 43.3 95 CI 1.76-1000 p 0.0216. Overall our results suggest that the prevalence of resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones due to ESBLs ACBLs and PMQR genes present in bovine nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica isolates has remained relatively constant in the isolates screened over a 14-year period.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a multigrid block-based preconditioner for solving linear systems arising from a Discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the all-speed Navier-Stokes equations with phase change. The equations are discretized in conservative form with a reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin rDG method and integrated with fully-implicit time discretization schemes. To robustly converge the numerically stiff systems we use the Newton-Krylov framework with a primitive-variable formulation pressure velocity and temperature which is better conditioned than the conservative-variable form at low-Mach number. In the limit of large acoustic CFL number and viscous Fourier number there is a strong coupling between the velocity-pressure system and the linear systems become non-diagonally dominant. To effectively solve these ill-conditioned systems an approximate block factorization preconditioner is developed which uses the Schur complement to reduce a 33 block system into a sequence of two 22 block systems velocity-pressure vP and velocity-temperature vT. We compare the performance of the vP-vT Schur complement preconditioner to classic preconditioning strategies monolithic algebraic multigrid AMG element-block SOR and primitive variable block Gauss-Seidel. The performance of the preconditioned solver is investigated in the limit of large CFL and Fourier numbers for low-Mach lid-driven cavity flow Rayleigh-Bnard melt convection compressible internally heated convection and 3D laser-induced melt pool flow. Numerical results demonstrate that the vP-vT Schur complement preconditioned solver scales well both algorithmically and in parallel and is robust for highly ill-conditioned systems for all tested rDG discretization schemes up to 4th-order.",

    "abstract": "AIMS Surgical excision of all benign vascular lesions of the breast identified by core needle biopsy has been recommended in the past to rule out a more serious lesion. In this study we investigated the clinical radiological and pathological findings in patients diagnosed with a benign vascular lesion at our institution to assess whether excision may be spared for lesions without atypia. METHODS AND RESULTS We searched the electronic medical record for patients with a vascular lesion of the breast diagnosed between 2000 and 2015. The study population consisted of 84 patients 83 females and one male. The index diagnoses included 76 benign vascular lesions five vascular lesions with cytological atypia and three angiosarcomas. A radiologist reviewed all pre- and post-biopsy imaging studies all cases had concordant radiological and pathological findings. Based on radiological and histological correlation the vascular lesion accounted for the radiological target in 40 48 cases and was deemed an incidental finding in 44 52. Seven of 32 22 targeted and 10 of 44 23 incidental benign vascular lesions underwent surgical excision there were no upgrades at excision. No recurrences or clinical events were observed in patients with a targeted or incidental benign vascular lesion with a median follow-up of 39 months and 40.6 months respectively. CONCLUSION Our data suggest that benign vascular lesions diagnosed on core biopsy with concordant radiological and pathological findings do not warrant surgical excision.",

Herbicides were applied at seedling tillering and heading growth stages. In addition a study to determine glyphosate absorption and translocation in both species was conducted. Herbicide treatments were glyphosate at 541 841 and 1121 g ha -1 and sethoxydim clethodim and quizalofop at 350 210 and 70 g ha-1 respectively. In general control of prairie cupgrass and windmillgrass increased as the rate of glyphosate increased. In addition windmillgrass was less susceptible to glyphosate at heading and seedling stages than was prairie cupgrass. Efficacy of all ACCase-inhibiting herbicides applied at any growth stage was equal to or greater than efficacy of the highest rate of glyphosate applied at the same stage. Furthermore all herbicide treatments were more phytotoxic to prairie cupgrass and windmillgrass at seedling stage than at tillering or heading. Differential response of prairie cupgrass and windmillgrass to glyphosate was attributed to differences in glyphosate translocation. Separate field experiments were conducted to evaluate preemergence PRE and postemergence POST herbicide treatments for prairie cupgrass and windmillgrass in no-till corn at Hays KS in 2001 and 2002. All PRE treatments provided at least 90 control of windmillgrass in both years 6 wk after treatment WAT. Prairie cupgrass was controlled effectively by acetochlor plus atrazine alachlor plus atrazine and 5-metolachlor plus atrazine in 2001. In 2002 the only PRE treatments that gave 90 control or greater of prairie cupgrass 6 WAT were alachlor plus atrazine and pendimethalin plus atrazine. Glyphosate sequential treatment was the only POST treatment that provided 100 control of prairie cupgrass and windmillgrass in both years.",

The type of disordered breathing event was verified by esophageal pressure and bias-flow mask recordings. Obstructive apnea occurred to a variable extent in all patients and was characterized by stereotyped paradoxical motion of the RC or ABD or both in 49 patients 91. There was no paradox in 2 patients with feeble inspiratory effort during obstructions and in 3 patients with normal inspiratory effort during obstructed breaths. The more obese patients displayed paradox of the ABD rather than of the RC. Paradox did not occur in central apnea or in the central component of mixed apnea. Obstructive hypopnea was characterized by paradox during part of the breath. We conclude that RC and ABD motion can adequately characterize apnea in most patients and thus avoid invasive monitoring techniques that can adversely affect sleep. However if chest wall motion suggests that all apneas are central a direct measurement of respiratory effort is necessary to exclude obstruction.",

METHODS We surveyed predominantly nonacademic urologists and pathologists. The response rate was 57 21 of 271 urologists and 47 55 of 85 pathologists. RESULTS Fifty-five percent of urologists performed six or more site-designated biopsies 41 used unspecified bilateral biopsies. More than one half of urologists and pathologists reported submitting or receiving six or more separate site-designated containers. The remainder of physicians less than one half reported the submission of all left needle cores in one container and all right cores in the other. Most pathologists 70 stated that billing depended on the number of containers 15 were unsure. One hundred percent of academic and 68 of nonacademic urologists deemed the report format therapeutically relevant P 0.03 as did 57 of pathologists. Physicians submitting or receiving sextant needle biopsies in separate containers shared a 31 preference for issuance of a separate line diagnosis for each sextant site instead of condensing all diagnoses into one line with one Gleason score. Similarly for each biopsy site 61 of urologists wanted a separate Gleason score and 68 wanted a separate designation for the percentage of tissue with tumor. Fifty-six percent and 64 of urologists and pathologists respectively deemed it relevant to specify the sites of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia even if cancer were present. CONCLUSIONS Much variation persists in prostate biopsy sampling and reporting hindering communication among physicians from different institutions. However similar percentages of urologists and pathologists reported separate versus combined site sampling and separate versus combined site report format preferences.",

    "abstract": "Long-lived mutant mice both Ames dwarf and growth hormone receptor gene-disrupted or knockout strains exhibit heightened cognitive robustness and altered IGF1 signaling in the brain. Here we report in both these long-lived mice that three up-regulated lead microRNAs miR-470 miR-669b and miR-681 are involved in posttranscriptional regulation of genes pertinent to growth hormoneIGF1 signaling. All three are most prominently localized in the hippocampus and correspond to reduced expression of key IGF1 signaling genes IGF1 IGF1R and PI3 kinase. The decline in these genes expression translates into decreased phosphorylation of downstream molecules AKT and FoxO3a. Cultures transfected with either miR-470 miR-669b or miR-681 show repressed endogenous expression of all three genes of the IGF1 signaling axis most significantly IGF1R while other similarly up-regulated microRNAs including let-7g and miR-509 do not induce the same levels of repression. Transduction study in IGF1-responsive cell cultures shows significantly reduced IGF1R expression and AKT to some extent most notably by miR-681. This is accompanied by decreased levels of downstream phosphorylated forms of AKT and FoxO3a upon IGF1 stimulation. Suppression of IGF1R by the three microRNAs is further validated by IGF1R 3UTR reporter assays. Taken together our results suggest that miR-470 miR-669b and miR-681 are all functionally able to suppress IGF1R and AKT two upstream genes controlling FoxO3a phosphorylation status. Their up-regulation in growth hormone signaling-deficient mutant mouse brain suggests reduced IGF1 signaling at the posttranscriptional level for numerous gains of neuronal function in these long-lived mice.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recommended systolic blood pressure targets often do not consider the relationship of low diastolic blood pressure DBP levels with cardiovascular disease CVD and all-cause mortality risk which is especially relevant for older people with concurrent comorbidities. We examined the relationship of DBP levels to CVD and all-cause mortality in older women in the Womens Health Initiative Long Life Study WHI-LLS. METHODS The study sample included 7875 women mean age 79 years who underwent a blood pressure measurement at an in-person home visit conducted in 2012-2013. CVD and all-cause mortality were centrally adjudicated. Hazard ratios HRs were obtained from adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS After 5 years follow-up all-cause mortality occurred in 18.4 of women. Compared with a DBP of 80 mm Hg the fully adjusted HR for mortality was 1.33 95 confidence interval CI 1.04-1.71 for a DBP of 50 mm Hg and 1.67 95 CI 1.29-2.16 for a DBP of 100 mm Hg. The HRs for CVD were 1.14 95 CI 0.78-1.67 for a DBP of 50 mm Hg and HR 1.50 95 CI 1.03-2.17 for a DBP of 100 mm Hg. The nadir DBP associated with lowest mortality risk was 72 mm Hg overall. CONCLUSIONS In older women consideration should be given to the potential adverse effects of low and high DBP. Low DBP may serve as a risk marker. DBP target levels between 68 and 75 mm Hg may avoid higher mortality risk.",

Since both tetrapyrroles are pro-oxidants it is essential that their metabolism is tightly regulated. Here we establish that heme-derived linear tetrapyrroles bilins function to stimulate the enzymatic activity of magnesium chelatase MgCh via their interaction with GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 GUN4 in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii A key tetrapyrrole-binding component of MgCh found in all oxygenic photosynthetic species CrGUN4 also stabilizes the bilin-dependent accumulation of protoporphyrin IX-binding CrCHLH1 subunit of MgCh in light-grown C. reinhardtii cells by preventing its photooxidative inactivation. Exogenous application of biliverdin IX reverses the loss of CrCHLH1 in the bilin-deficient heme oxygenase hmox1 mutant but not in the gun4 mutant. We propose that these dual regulatory roles of GUN4bilin complexes are responsible for the retention of bilin biosynthesis in all photosynthetic eukaryotes which sustains chlorophyll biosynthesis in an illuminated oxic environment.",

METHOD Multi-institutional cohort study of the milestones reported to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for all 21 pediatric subcompetencies. Most subcompetencies were measured using five milestone levels 1 novice 2 advanced beginner 3 competent 4 proficient 5 master 3 subcompetencies had only four levels defined. RESULTS Milestone assessments for 2030 pediatric residents in 47 programs during academic year 2013-2014 were obtained. There was significant variation in end-of-year milestone ratings for residents within each level of training which decreased as training level increased. Most 78.9 434550 graduating third-year pediatric residents received a milestone rating of 3 in all 21 subcompetencies fewer 21.1 116550 received a rating of 4 in all subcompetencies. Across all training levels professionalism and interpersonal communication skills were rated highest quality improvement was rated lowest. CONCLUSIONS Trainees entered residency with a wide range of skills. As they advanced skill variability within a training level decreased. Most graduating pediatric residents were still advancing on the milestone continuum toward proficiency and mastery and an expectation of milestone ratings 4 in all categories upon graduation is unrealistic milestone ratings 3 upon graduation may be more realistic. Understanding current pediatric residents and graduates skills can help to identify key areas that should be specifically targeted during training.",

PROCEDURE Eligibility criteria included untreated patients 21 years of age with stage IIIIV extragonadal extra cranial MGCT. Patients received four cycles repeated every 3 weeks of cisplatin 20 mgm2 day 5 days etoposide 100 mgm2 day 5 days and bleomycin 15 mgm2 on Day 1 with escalating doses of cyclophosphamide on Day 1 assigned at the time of enrollment 1.2 1.8 or 2.4 gm2. Patients with complete response had therapy discontinued. Patients with residual disease underwent second-look surgery those with pathologic evidence of residual MGCT or whose markers had not normalized received two more cycles. All other patients had protocol therapy stopped. RESULTS Nineteen patients were enrolled between July 2004 and August 2007. Three patients were non-evaluable. Sixteen patients completed four cycles. Eleven had complete response one had progressive disease and four had partial response. All four with partial response underwent second look surgery followed by two more cycles. Only one patient on dose 1.8 gm2 experienced dose-limiting toxicity DLT during the first cycle of therapy grade 3 hyperglycemia. The 4-year EFS and OS standard deviation were 74 7 and 89 10 respectively. CONCLUSION The addition of cyclophosphamide to the standard PEB regimen cisplatin etoposide and bleomycin is feasible and well-tolerated at all dose levels used on this study.",

    "abstract": "Computational simulations are used to predict and understand the influence of fine water mists on the suppression of laminar freely propagating methane- propane- and hydrogen-air atmospheric-pressure premixed flames. The model solves a coupled chemically reacting two-phase-flow problem. Flame suppression is measured in terms of a reduction in burning velocity. The effects of droplet diameter net water loading and fuel-air stoichiometry are reported. The results show similar qualitative features for all the flames. Generally speaking smaller droplets are more effective than the larger droplets. Sufficiently small droplets approximately 10 m diameter for methane-air flames are in a small-droplet limit where even smaller droplets have the same suppression characteristics for the same net mass loading. Droplets above a certain diameter approximately 30 m for methane-air flames lead to a turning-point extinction where the burning velocity at the turning point is approximately half of the unperturbed burning velocity without any water-mist loading. 2005 The Combustion Institute.

Here an analysis of ReSTORE data evaluating efficacy outcomes by baseline Candida species is described. Susceptibility testing was performed for Candida species using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution method. There were 93 patients in the modified intent-to-treat population who received rezafungin 94 received caspofungin. Baseline Candida species distribution was similar in the two treatment groups C. albicans occurring in 41.9 and 42.6 of patients in the rezafungin and caspofungin groups respectively C. glabrata 25.8 and 26.6 and C. tropicalis 21.5 and 18.1 were the most common pathogens. Rates of global cure and mycological eradication at day 14 and day 30 all-cause mortality by Candida species were comparable in the rezafungin and caspofungin treatment groups and did not appear to be impacted by minimal inhibitory concentration MIC values for either rezafungin or caspofungin. Two patients had baseline isolates with non-susceptible MIC values both in the rezafungin group one non-susceptible to rezafungin and one to caspofungin classified as intermediate both were candidemia-only patients in whom rezafungin treatment was successful based on the day 30 all-cause mortality endpoint. This analysis of ReSTORE demonstrated the efficacy of rezafungin for candidemia and IC in patients infected with a variety of Candida species.",

Twelve anxious and 12 age- gender- and IQ-matched psychiatrically-healthy adolescents received not interested and interested feedback from unknown peers during a Chatroom task administered in a neuroimaging scanner. No group differences emerged in subjective ratings to peer feedback but all participants reported more negative emotion at being rejected than accepted by peers to whom they had assigned high desirability ratings. Further highlighting the salience of such feedback all adolescents independent of anxiety levels manifested elevated responses in the amygdala-hippocampal complex bilaterally during the anticipation of feedback. However anxious adolescents differed from healthy adolescents in their patterns of persistent amygdala-hippocampal activation following rejection. These data carry interesting implications for using neuroimaging data to inform psychotherapeutic approaches to social anxiety.",

Progress has been made in all areas including regenerating bone cartilage soft tissue and making up for bone defects with scaffolds. Bone regeneration and managing bone defects with scaffolds continue to be successful in the basic science realm with promising results but currently these successes are mostly limited to small animal models. Cartilage defects have more clinically available treatment options but the benefits of off-the-shelf allograft options and scaffolds have little clinical evidence in the acute fracture setting. Most of the true chondrocyte replacement therapies such as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral allografts require delayed treatment while cell growth or graft matching occurs. Soft-tissue defects can be managed with tissue engineering for the skin with success but muscle and nerve defects are still limited to the basic science arena. Although significant gains have been made in all areas for tissue engineering in basic science and is very promising this success currently comes with limited translation into clinical availability for the orthopaedic trauma patient.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the open water propeller characteristics and the four-quadrant propeller models as applied to a torpedo-shaped underwater vehicle. A series of experiments with a Gavia autonomous underwater vehicle propeller were conducted in the towing tank using a rotor testing apparatus. The purpose of these tests was to measure the propeller thrust and torque under varying flow conditions and then to be used as the basis of the developed propeller models. These mathematical models were constructed using two regression models a polynomial and a Fourier series. Model coefficients were derived using the method of least squares and a comparison analysis was also conducted to test the robustness of the methodology. Results show that the Fourier series models were able to produce a reasonable and accurate approximation of thrust and torque coefficients with a small number of parameters in the examined condition of this study. The obtained four-quadrant open water characteristics of the autonomous underwater vehicle propeller model would be utilised to improve the system mathematical model for more accurate simulation and controller design to compare the autonomous underwater vehicle performance equipped with different propulsion units and to validate computational fluid dynamic results.",

Analysis of heteroduplex molecules revealed that the A T-rich region of these mtDNAs has undergone quite extensive base sequence divergence whereas the remainder of the molecule was found to share apparently complete base sequence homology in all three species. The differences in the sizes of the A T-rich regions as determined from the heteroduplex measurements completely account for the differences in the total sizes of these mtDNAs. A segment of approximately 0.1 kb is conserved within the A T-rich regions of D. simulans and D. virilis mtDNAs but not within the A T-rich region of D. melanogaster mtDNA. HaeIII restriction endonuclease analysis of the heteroduplex molecules has further shown that the unique HaeIII site of D. virilis mtDNA molecule is apparently conserved in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans mtDNA molecules. Finally electrophoretic patterns of HaeIII-digested mtDNAs from all three species were found to be different and distinguishable from each other suggesting that single base substitutions have probably taken place throughout the entire mitochondrial genome. 1979.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Research has consistently identified firearm availability as a risk factor for suicide. However existing studies are relatively small in scale estimates vary widely and no study appears to have tracked risks from commencement of firearm ownership. METHODS We identified handgun acquisitions and deaths in a cohort of 26.3 million male and female residents of California 21 years old or older who had not previously acquired handguns. Cohort members were followed for up to 12 years 2 months from October 18 2004 to December 31 2016. We used survival analysis to estimate the relationship between handgun ownership and both all-cause mortality and suicide by firearm and by other methods among men and women. The analysis allowed the baseline hazard to vary according to neighborhood and was adjusted for age race and ethnic group and ownership of long guns i.e. rifles or shotguns. RESULTS A total of 676425 cohort members acquired one or more handguns and 1457981 died 17894 died by suicide of which 6691 were suicides by firearm. Rates of suicide by any method were higher among handgun owners with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.34 for all male owners as compared with male nonowners 95 confidence interval CI 3.13 to 3.56 and 7.16 for female owners as compared with female nonowners 95 CI 6.22 to 8.24. These rates were driven by much higher rates of suicide by firearm among both male and female handgun owners with a hazard ratio of 7.82 for men 95 CI 7.26 to 8.43 and 35.15 for women 95 CI 29.56 to 41.79. Handgun owners did not have higher rates of suicide by other methods or higher all-cause mortality. The risk of suicide by firearm among handgun owners peaked immediately after the first acquisition but 52 of all suicides by firearm among handgun owners occurred more than 1 year after acquisition. CONCLUSIONS Handgun ownership is associated with a greatly elevated and enduring risk of suicide by firearm. Funded by the Fund for a Safer Future and others..",

We show here that CYP2W1 exhibits tight binding affinities for retinoids which have low nanomolar binding constants and much poorer binding constants in the micromolar range for four other ligands. CYP2W1 converts all-transretinoic acid atRA to 4-hydroxyatRA and all-transretinol to 4-OH all-transretinol and it also oxidizes retinal. The enzyme much less efficiently oxidizes 17-estradiol to 2-hydroxy-17-estradiol and farnesol to a monohydroxylated product arachidonic acid is at best a negligible substrate. These findings indicate that CYP2W1 probably plays an important role in localized retinoid metabolism that may be intimately linked to its involvement in tumor development.",

OBJECTIVES The correlation between pre-operative diffusion tensor imaging DTI metrics and post-operative clinical outcomes in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy DCM has been widely investigated with different studies reporting varied findings. We conducted a systematic review to determine the association between DTI metric and clinical outcomes after surgery. METHODS We identified relevant articles that investigated the relationship between pre-operative DTI indices and post-operative outcome in DCM patients by searching PubMedMEDLINE Web of Science Scopus and EMBASE from inception until October 2023. In addition quantitative synthesis and meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS FA was significantly correlated with postoperative JOA or mJOA across all age and follow up subgroups changes observed in JOA or mJOA from preoperative to postoperative stages JOA or mJOA in subgroups aged 65 and above and in those with a follow-up period of 6 months or more as well as recovery rate in all studies pooled together and also in the under-65 age bracket. Additionally a significant correlation was demonstrated between recovery rate and ADC across all age groups. No other significant correlations were discovered between DTI parameters MD AD and ADC and post-operative outcomes. CONCLUSION DTI is a quantitative noninvasive evaluation tool that correlates with severity of DCM. However the current evidence is still elusive regarding whether DTI metric is a validated tool for predicting the degree of post-operative recovery which could potentially be useful in patient selection for surgery.",

    "abstract": "The goals of the present study were to assess the interrelationships among tasks from the MATRICS and CNTRACS batteries to determine the degree to which tasks from each battery capture unique variance in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia and to determine the ability of tasks from each battery to predict functional outcome. Subjects were 104 schizophrenia patients and 132 healthy control subjects recruited as part of the CNTRACS initiative. All subjects completed four CNTRACS tasks and two tasks from the MATRICS battery Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia Symbol Coding and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Functional outcome was also assessed in the schizophrenia subjects. In both the patient and control groups we found significant intercorrelations between all higher order cognitive tasks episodic memory goal maintenance processing speed verbal learning but minimal relationships with the visual task. For almost all tasks scores were significantly related to measures of functional outcome with higher associations between CNTRACS tasks and performance-based measures of function and between one of the MATRICS tasks and self-reported functioning relative to the other functioning measures. After regressing out variance shared by other tasks we continued to observe group differences in performance among task residuals particularly for measures of episodic memory from both batteries although these residuals did not correlate as robustly with functional outcome as raw test scores. These findings suggest that there exists both shared and specific variance across cognitive tasks related to cognitive and functional impairments in schizophrenia and that measures derived from cognitive neuroscience can predict functional capacity and status in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "The goal of our project is to develop a unique ligand-conjugated nanoparticle NP therapy against childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL. LLP2A discovered by Dr. Kit Lam is a high-affinity and high-specificity peptidomimetic ligand against an activated 41 integrin. Our study using 11 fresh primary ALL samples 10 precursor B ALL and 1 T ALL showed that childhood ALL cells expressed activated 41 integrin and bound to LLP2A. Normal hematopoietic cells such as activated lymphocytes and monocytes expressed activated 41 integrin however normal hematopoietic stem cells showed low expression of 41 integrin. Therefore we believe that LLP2A can be used as a targeted therapy for childhood ALL. The Lam lab has developed novel telodendrimer-based nanoparticles NPs which can carry drugs efficiently. We have also developed a human leukemia mouse model using immunodeficient NODSCIDIL2R null mice engrafted with primary childhood ALL cells from our patients. LLP2A-conjugated NPs will be evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using primary leukemia cells and this mouse model. NPs will be loaded first with DiD near infra-red dye and then with the chemotherapeutic agents daunorubicin or vincristine. Both drugs are mainstays of current chemotherapy for childhood ALL. Targeting properties of LLP2A-conjugated NPs will be evaluated by fluorescent microscopy flow cytometry MTS assay and mouse survival after treatment. We expect that LLP2A-conjugated NPs will be preferentially delivered and endocytosed to leukemia cells as an effective targeted therapy. 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers SPIE.",

    "abstract": "Urine metabolites are used in many clinical and biomedical studies but usually only for a few classic compounds. Metabolomics detects vastly more metabolic signals that may be used to precisely define the health status of individuals. However many compounds remain unidentified hampering biochemical conclusions. Here we annotate all metabolites detected by two untargeted metabolomic assays hydrophilic interaction chromatography HILIC-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry and charged surface hybrid CSH-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry. Over 9000 unique metabolite signals were detected of which 42 triggered MSMS fragmentations in data-dependent mode. On the highest Metabolomics Standards Initiative MSI confidence level 1 we identified 175 compounds using authentic standards with precursor mass retention time and MSMS matching. An additional 578 compounds were annotated by precursor accurate mass and MSMS matching alone MSI level 2 including a novel library specifically geared at acylcarnitines CarniBlast. The rest of the metabolome is usually left unannotated. To fill this gap we used the in silico fragmentation tool CSIFingerID and the new NIST hybrid search to annotate all further compounds MSI level 3. Testing the top-ranked metabolites in CSIFinger ID annotations yielded 40 accuracy when applied to the MSI level 1 identified compounds. We classified all MSI level 3 annotations by the NIST hybrid search using the ClassyFire ontology into 21 superclasses that were further distinguished into 184 chemical classes. ClassyFire annotations showed that the previously unannotated urine metabolome consists of 28 derivatives of organic acids 16 heterocyclics and 16 lipids as major classes.",

However relational memory problems may limit prospective utilization of FPE information. This study examines whether memory for FPE can be improved by testing participants during the initial FPE workshop presentation. METHOD Data were obtained from 20 people with EP and 20 demographically matched healthy comparison subjects HC. During session one FPE was presented in small group workshops with half of the information re-studied twice re-study condition and the remaining information tested twice using cued recall tasks retrieval practice condition. One week later session two delayed cued recall was tested for all FPE information. Testing effects i.e. better memory following retrieval practice versus re-study were examined across all items standard analysis and also limited to items successfully retrieved during session one conditionalized analysis. RESULTS HC had better initial recall and learned more over the two retrieval practice trials than EP. However HC also lost more information than EP over the one-week delay. Both groups produced a significant testing effect. This effect was smaller in EP versus HC across all test items but did not differ for the conditionalized analysis. Negative symptoms were inversely correlated with delayed cued recall in EP. CONCLUSIONS EP participants benefit from retrieval practice with participants with less severe negative symptoms showing the greatest benefit. These results encourage use of memory tests during group psychoeducation to improve subsequent long-term recall of clinically relevant information.",

In this brief review we discuss recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying phototropism gravitropism hydrotropism and autostraightening. Careful molecular genetic and physiological studies have helped confirm the importance of lateral auxin gradients in gravitropic and phototropic responses. However auxin signaling does not explain all tropisms recent work has shown that abscisic acid signaling mediates root hydrotropism and has implicated mechanosensing in autostraightening the organ straightening process recently modeled as a proprioceptive response. The interactions between distinct tropic signaling pathways and other internal and external sensory processes are also now being untangled.",

Recent studies suggest that phospholipid PL form of dietary n-3 PUFA may lead to their higher tissue accretion than triacylglycerol TAG form. We compared efficacy of PL-docosahexaenoic acid 226n-3 DHA and TAG-DHA on onset and severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE in a mouse model of MS. Female mice were fed low alpha-linolenic acid 183n-3 ALA diet control for 2 weeks and then fed either control 0.3 or 1.0 DHA PL or TAG for 4 weeks pre-EAE induction and 4 weeks post-EAE induction. The brain and spinal cord n-6n-3 ratio was significantly lower in all mice fed DHA compared to control. EAE onset was delayed in mice fed both DHA forms and concentrations except for 1 TAG-DHA. The inverse association between the EAE score and the brain DHA concentration was nonsignificant at the end of the study p 0.08. Daily EAE scores of mice fed different DHA diets did not differ from control however the score of all DHA groups combined during days 9-16 was lower p 0.028 compared to the control. During days 17-22 the EAE score trended lower in 0.3 TAG-DHA and during days 23-28 the EAE score trended lower in both PL-DHA groups than those in all other groups. These findings suggest that TAG-DHA may be more effective than PL-DHA in the early phases of EAE and in the final outcome PL-DHA may be more effective than TAG-DHA.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To assess whether no enhancement on pre-treatment MRI can rule out malignancy of additional US masses initially assessed as BI-RADS 3 or 4 in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. METHODS This retrospective study included consecutive women from 2010-2018 with newly diagnosed breast cancer at least one additional breast mass distinct from index cancer assigned a BI-RADS 3 or 4 on US and a bilateral contrast-enhanced breast MRI performed within 90 days of US. All malignant masses were pathologically proven benign masses were pathologically proven or defined as showing at least 2 years of imaging stability. Incidence of malignant masses and NPV were calculated on a per-patient level using proportions and exact 95 CIs. RESULTS In 230 patients with 309 additional masses 140309 45 masses did not enhance while 169309 55 enhanced on MRI. Of the 140 masses seen in 105 women mean age 54 years range 28-82 with no enhancement on MRI all had adequate follow-up and 140140 100 were benign of which 89140 63.6 were pathologically proven and 51140 36.4 demonstrated at least 2 years of imaging stability. Pre-treatment MRI demonstrating no enhancement of US mass correlates had an NPV of 100 95 CI 96.7-100.0. CONCLUSIONS All BI-RADS 3 and 4 US masses with a non-enhancing correlate on pre-treatment MRI were benign. The incorporation of MRI when ordered by the referring physician may decrease unnecessary follow-up imaging andor biopsy if the initial US BI-RADS assessment and management recommendation were to be retrospectively updated. KEY POINTS Of 309 BI-RADS 3 or 4 US masses with a corresponding mass on MRI 140309 45 demonstrated no enhancement whereas 169309 55 demonstrated enhancement All masses classified as BI-RADS 3 or 4 on US without enhancement on MRI were benign MRI can rule out malignancy in non-enhancing US masses with an NPV of 100.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells have been proposed to treat liver disease in the dog. The objective of this study was to compare portal systemic intravenous and splenic injections for administration of mesenchymal stem cells to target the liver in healthy beagle dogs. Four healthy beagle dogs were included in the study. Each dog received mesenchymal stem cells via all three delivery methods in randomized order 1 week apart. Ten million fat-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells labeled with Technetium-99m 99mTc-hexamethyl-propylene amine oximeHMPAO were used for each injection. Right lateral left lateral ventral and dorsal scintigraphic images were obtained with a gamma camera equipped with a low-energy all-purpose collimator immediately after injection and 1 6 and 24 h later. Mesenchymal stem cells distribution was assessed subjectively using all four views. Pulmonary hepatic and splenic uptake was quantified from the right lateral view at each time point. Portal injection resulted in diffuse homogeneous high uptake through the liver whereas the systemic intravenous injection led to mesenchymal stem cell trapping in the lungs. After splenic injection mild splenic retention and high homogeneous diffuse hepatic uptake were observed. Systemic injection of mesenchymal stem cells may not be a desirable technique for liver therapy due to pulmonary trapping. Splenic injection represents a good alternative to portal injection. Scintigraphic tracking with 99mTc-HMPAO is a valuable technique for assessing mesenchymal stem cells distribution and quantification shortly after administration. Data obtained at 24 h should be interpreted cautiously due to suboptimal labeling persistence.",

The isolation of Salmonella from all rows and from all flocks using single or pooled swabs was 80 and 92 respectively. Hence there was no statistical difference between single vs. pooled swabs in terms of identifying Salmonella on a row or flock basis. A total of 14 serogroups comprising 44 serotypes were isolated from 123 of 133 farms. When the top 10 serotypes were considered there was no significant difference in the range of serotypes isolated by the two culturing methods. The overall S. enteritidis prevalence for California flocks was 10.5 14133. The overall row prevalence for S. enteritidis for all the farms was 1.1 242128 and the overall pool prevalence was 2.4 13532. Sixty percent 1220 of the S. enteritidis isolates from the positive farms were phage type 4 and 40 820 represented five other phage types 1 6B 7 8 and 28.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspBackground Improving outcomes for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC requires more complete understanding of pancreatic carcinogenesis including tumor heterogeneity and mutational evolution. Such studies in PDAC are hampered by presentation at advanced stages and rarely operable recurrences. We present a case of metachronous PDAC managed by serial resections and interrogated by whole genome sequencing of all three lesions.jatsp jatspMethods Tumors underwent either laser capture microscopy or flow cytometry of fresh frozen tissue. Germline DNA was obtained from normal tissue. Genomic DNA was isolated and sequencing libraries were prepared. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500 system. Pipeline analysis included quality control alignment to the reference genome hg19 variant calling and annotation. Structural variants were called by the union of two tools DELLY and CREST. Copy number variants were called using an in-house tool. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and short insertions and deletions were identified by the intersection of two tools Strelka and MuTect and annotated using ANNOVAR. All structural copy number and non-silent variants were manually reviewed in the Integrated Genome Viewer. Secondary analyses were done in R. Representative sections of the three tumors also underwent formalin fixation paraffin embedding sectioning at five micron thickness and hematoxylin and eosin staining for microscopic analysis.jatsp jatspResults The first tumor was located in the head of the pancreas and resected by Whipple operation the second and third in the body and tail respectively and resected by completion pancreatectomy 14 months later. The patient received chemotherapy in the interim.jatsp jatspHistologically all 3 tumors were moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas with focal mucinous areas and extensive lymphovascular and perineural invasion. There were no distinguishing morphological features.jatsp jatspFor the 3 lesions we achieved average sequence coverage of 52.3x 54.3x and 70.7x respectively.jatsp jatspA total of 69 structural variants and 62 copy number variants were identified with concordance of 75 and 92 in all three lesions.jatsp jatspA total of 61 non-silent exonic variants were identified with concordance of 33 in all three lesions. A KRAS NM_004985 c.G34C missense and TP53 NM_001126115 c.G418A missense were present in all three whereas a SMAD4 NM_005359 c.118delC frameshift was present in only the second and third tumors.jatsp jatspHierarchical clustering by non-silent variants copy number variants and an intersect of all variants showed the tumors in the head and tail to be more closely related to one another than to the body lesion whereas clustering by structural variants showed little difference between the three.jatsp jatspConclusions The highly similar structural and copy number profiles across the three lesions suggests that these tumors arose from a common precursor and that large chromosomal changes occurred early in its mutational evolution.jatsp jatspThe poor concordance of simple somatic mutations imply that these evolved gradually and are responsible for tumor heterogeneity and possibly acquired phenotypes include therapeutic resistance.jatsp jatspThis study also demonstrates that isolated intra-parenchymal metastases as opposed to de novo tumors within a field defect are possible with PDAC which has been suggested in case reports but never definitively proven further implying that these patients may benefit from re-operation despite disease relapse.jatsp jatspFurther analysis will include mathematical modeling of mutation rates and validation in three additional metachronous cases identified in our biospecimen repository and in specimens obtained by our rapid autopsy program.jatsp jatspCitation Format Ashton A.

We propose that these interventions may increase scepticism towards all information including accurate information. Across three online survey experiments in three diverse countries the United States Poland and Hong Kong total n 6127 we tested the negative spillover effects of existing strategies and compared them with three alternative interventions against misinformation. We examined how exposure to fact-checking media literacy tips and media coverage of misinformation affects individuals perception of both factual and false information as well as their trust in key democratic institutions. Our results show that while all interventions successfully reduce belief in false information they also negatively impact the credibility of factual information. This highlights the need for further improved strategies that minimize the harms and maximize the benefits of interventions against misinformation.",

The Danish Cardiovascular Screening trial DANCAVAS involved men aged 65-74 years old who were randomized to an invitation to undergo screening or not. While the 5-year interim analysis did not show a statistically significant benefit in the primary outcome of all-cause mortality HR 0.95 CI 0.90-1.00 a sub-group analysis of men age 65-69 did show a lower hazard ratio of 0.89 CI 0.83-0.96. Given the widening difference between screened and un-screened participants as well as the benefit in younger subjects it is likely that the next analysis will demonstrate a statistically-significant benefit of screening. In this commentary we argue why this trial will almost certainly become one of the most influential screening trials and why heeding its most important lesson the use of coronary artery calcium scoring has the potential to save countless lives.",

    "abstract": "The successful excision of a locally invasive tumor such as canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma CAA typically results in a mandibular contour-derforming critical-size defect that alters the jaw kinematics and may affect the patients quality of life. In this case series we describe our experience using the regenerative approach of a titanium locking plate and compression resistant matrix infused with rhBMP-2 for the immediate or delayed reconstruction following mandibulectomy for the excision of mandibular CAA in 11 dogs. Surgical planning included computed tomography CT with and without contrast in all cases and 3D-printed models in four cases. Tumor-free surgical margins were achieved in all dogs. Clinical and diagnostic imaging follow-up mean 23.1 months were performed in-person 11 cases and with CTcone-beam computed tomography in most cases with standard radiography 3 cases and telemedicine being utilized in 5 cases. At 2 weeks postoperatively hard tissue was palpable at the defect. Follow-up imaging at 1 month postoperatively revealed evidence of bridging new bone with a heterogeneous appearance that remodeled over 3-6 months to bone of a similar size shape and trabecular pattern as native bone. Histological evaluation of regenerated bone was available in two cases and was supportive of our clinical and imaging findings of normal remodeled bone. Clinically all dogs returned to a normal lifestyle rapidly resumed eating and drinking and exhibited normal occlusion. Complications included wound dehiscence in one dog and self-limiting exuberant bone formation in two dogs. Tumor regrowth failure of the implant or fracture of the regenerated bone were not observed. We conclude that the mandibular reconstruction using a regenerative approach is safe feasible and results in restoration of mandibular contour in dogs following segmental and bilateral rostral mandibulectomy for benign but invasive oral tumors such as CAA.",

DATA SOURCE Pediatric Health Information System Dataset consisting of all pediatric discharges 21 years of age from 34 academic freestanding childrens hospitals for calendar year 2003. METHODS The rates of PSIs were computed for all discharges. The patient and institutional characteristics associated with these PSIs were calculated. The analyses sequentially applied three increasingly conservative methods to control for the institution-level effects robust standard error estimation a fixed effects model and a random effects model. The degree of difference from a base state which excluded institution-level variables and between the models was calculated. The effects of these analyses on the interpretation of the PSIs are presented. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS PSIs are relatively infrequent events in hospitalized children ranging from 0 per 10000 postoperative hip fracture to 87 per 10000 postoperative respiratory failure. Significant variables associated PSIs included age neonates race Caucasians payor status public insurance severity of illness extreme and hospital size 300 beds which all had higher rates of PSIs than their reference groups in the bivariable logistic regression results. The three different approaches of adjusting for institution-level effects demonstrated that there were similarities in both the clinical and statistical significance across each of the models. CONCLUSIONS Institution-level effects can be appropriately controlled for by using a variety of methods in the analyses of administrative data. Whenever possible resource-conservative methods should be used in the analyses especially if clinical implications are minimal.",

This projects purpose was to evaluate program feasibility utilization and acceptability. Our mixed-methods evaluation included analyses of data from electronic health records client satisfaction surveys and staff interviews. RESULTS During the 6-month pilot the Case Manager served 133 clients about one third of all SBHC clients served through 593 contacts. Most contacts included referrals to support services 90 and 37 addressed newcomer immigrant adjustment. All 37 respondents to the satisfaction survey during the 3-month administration period 44 response rate reported that the Case Manager made them feel comfortable asking for help 95 reported getting the help they needed. The 7 SBHC staff interviewed shared many program benefits including increased time for clinical services. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH POLICY PRACTICE AND EQUITY Inequities in childrens health and educational achievement are influenced by structural factors. Results from our pilot program demonstrate that SBHCs may be well-positioned to deliver social care interventions and that case managers enhance the ability to deliver quality care. CONCLUSIONS School-based programs to address unmet social needs are critical to supporting learning and wellness for all youth. Robust studies are needed to further test the impacts of case management in SBHCs.",

We find that in equilibrium the degree to which the heuristic strategy differs from the Bayesian strategy depends on 1 the convexity of a firms marginal profits with respect to their opponents private information and 2 whether firm strategies are complementary or substitutable. Under certain conditions firms equilibrium profits are greater when all firms use heuristics than when all firms use the full information.

In this study five 3.7-m long horizontal columns each containing 0.15 m3 of natural sand were treated to address current knowledge gaps regarding the application of MICP at field-scale including investigating treatment extent improvement of spatial uniformity stimulation strategies and posttreatment removal of ammonium by-products. Two stimulated columns containing poorly graded alluvial sand were treated to achieve high and low ureolytic rates to investigate differences in treatment uniformity and extent. An additional column with the same sand was augmented with Sporosarcina pasteurii targeting a high ureolytic rate similar to the high rate stimulated column. Two additional stimulated columns containing poorly graded alluvial and marine sands were treated to achieve a low ureolytic rate to evaluate the effect of soil mineralogy. Treatments were first applied to establish either indigenous or augmented microorganisms after which all columns received nine cementation treatments. Following cementation produced ammonium by-products were removed using a rinse solution injection and soil samples were obtained and analyzed for calcite content. During all treatments solution urea and ammonium concentrations as well as soil hydraulic conductivities and shear wave velocities were monitored. In all columns insignificant changes in permeability were observed during treatments despite Vs increases up to 1325 ms. Results suggest that improvements in the spatial uniformity and extent of biocementation can be achieved through the use of lower ureolytic rates that minimize reactions during injections.",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome RTT is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2 encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor elevated in mature neurons and is predicted to be required for neuronal maturation by regulating multiple target genes. Identifying primary gene targets in either Mecp2-deficient mice or human RTT brain has proven to be difficult perhaps because of the transient requirement for MeCP2 during neuronal maturation. In order to experimentally control the timing of MeCP2 expression and deficiency during neuronal maturation human SH-SY5Y cells undergoing mature neuronal differentiation were transfected with methylated MeCP2 oligonucleotide decoy to disrupt the binding of MeCP2 to endogenous targets. Genome-wide expression microarray analysis identified all four known members of the inhibitors of differentiation or inhibitors of DNA-binding ID1 ID2 ID3 and ID4 subfamily of helix-loop-helix genes as novel neuronal targets of MeCP2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed binding of MeCP2 near or within the promoters of ID1 ID2 and ID3 and quantitative RT-PCR confirmed increased expression of all four Id genes in Mecp2-deficient mouse brain. All four ID proteins were significantly increased in Mecp2-deficient mouse and human RTT brain using immunofluorescence and laser scanning cytometric analyses. Because of their involvement in cell differentiation and neural development ID genes are ideal primary targets for MeCP2 regulation of neuronal maturation that may explain the molecular pathogenesis of RTT.",

Six dogs with histologically confirmed intracranial GCTs and MR imaging were included. Tumor location size mass effect T1- and T2-weighted signal intensity and peritumoral edema MR characteristics were recorded. In all dogs GCTs appeared as well-defined extra-axial masses with a plaque-form sessile distribution involving the meninges. All tumors were located along the convexity of the cerebrum the falx cerebri or the ventral floor of the cranial vault. All tumors were mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hyperintense on T2-weighted images. A moderate-to-severe degree of peritumoral edema and mass effect were evident in all dogs. Findings indicated that while several MR imaging characteristics were consistently identified in canine cerebral GCTs none of these characteristics were unique or distinctive for this tumor type alone.",

This prevents us from quantifying the main and interactive effects of anthropogenic environmental and climate change on species loss. Here we demonstrate that the estimated proportion of species loss of 252 key protected vertebrate species at a county level of China during the past half century was 27.2 for all taxa 47.7 for mammals 28.8 for amphibians and reptiles and 19.8 for birds. Both human population increase and species richness showed significant positive correlations with species loss of all taxa combined mammals birds and amphibians and reptiles. Temperature increase was positively correlated with all-taxa and bird species loss. Precipitation increase was negatively correlated with species loss of birds. Human population change and species richness showed more significant interactions with the other correlates of species loss. High species richness regions had higher species loss under the drivers of human environmental and climate change than low-richness regions. Consequently ongoing human environmental and climate changes are expected to perpetuate more negative effects on the survival of key vertebrate species particularly in high-biodiversity regions.",

Accomplishing this goal in an oncologic fashion is of paramount importance for all patients eligible for treatment with curative intent and for selected patients with metastatic disease. RECENT FINDINGS Ongoing advances in combined modality therapy and improved knowledge regarding the natural history and disease biology of individual sarcoma subtypes have allowed for better surgical planning and tailoring of the extent of resection depending on individual clinical radiographic and pathologic factors. SUMMARY Successful therapy for localized STS remains contingent on surgical resection with tumor-free margins. It is hoped that ongoing advances in the molecular and genetic understanding of the pathogenesis and biology of STS will lead to sustained improvements in the care of these patients and success will come from the ongoing development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies specific to histologic type.",

    "abstract": "California rice Oryza sativa L. growers typically use two forms of preplant N fertilizer aqua NH3 applied 7 to 10 cm below the soil surface subsurface N and surface-applied N. The rational for applying about 25 of the total N rate to the surface is to provide a readily available N source for young rice seedlings however no research has been done to verify this. On-farm field studies were conducted over a 3-yr period 12 site-years with the specific objectives of determining when rice begins to use subsurface N and to compare the efficiency of surface and subsurface applied N. Rice seedlings began accumulating subsurface N within 2 wk aft er sowing at some sites. When a portion of the N rate was applied to the surface early season plant biomass and N uptake was higher than when all of the fertilizer-N was applied subsurface. In contrast grain yields were higher when all of the N fertilizer was applied subsurface. Averaged across all sites the fertilizer-N recovery efficiency of surface-applied N was 38 compared to 53 when only subsurface N was applied. As aqua NH3 is less expensive than NH 4 based fertilizers and the application of surface N requires an additional field operation there is no justification to recommend the practice of applying surface N fertilizer in these rice systems. Instead all of the preplant N should be applied subsurface as aqua NH3. 2009 by the American Society of Agronomy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Overuse and misuse of opioids is a continuing crisis. The most common reason for children to receive opioids is postoperative pain and they are often prescribed more than needed. The amount of opioids prescribed varies widely even for minor ambulatory procedures. This study uses a large national sample to describe filled opioid prescriptions to preteen patients after all ambulatory surgical procedures and common standard procedures. METHODS We analyzed Truven Health MarketScan data for July 2012 through December 2016 to perform descriptive analyses of opioid fills by age and geographic area change over time second opioid fills in opioid-nave patients and variation in the types and amount of medication prescribed for 18 common and standard procedures in otolaryngology urology general surgery ophthalmology and orthopedics. RESULTS Over 10 of preteen children filled perioperative opioid prescriptions for ambulatory surgery in the period 2012 to 2016. The amount prescribed varied widely median 5 days supply IQR 3-8 range 1-90 even for the most minor procedures for example frenotomy median 4 days supply IQR 2-5 range 1-60. Codeine fills were common despite safety concerns. Second opioid prescriptions were filled by opioid-nave patients after almost all procedures studied. The rate of prescribing declined significantly over time and varied substantially by age and across census regions. CONCLUSIONS We identified opioid prescribing outside of the norms of standard practice in all of the specialties studied. Standardizing perioperative opioid prescribing and developing guidelines on appropriate prescribing for children may reduce the opioids available for misuse and diversion.",

A recent review demonstrated that the median citation error rate per biomedical journal was 39 and the median quotation error rate per journal was 20. Reference accuracy in pediatric orthopaedic articles has not been previously reported to our knowledge. METHODS Two hundred references from twenty articles published in four peer-reviewed orthopaedic journals were randomly selected for assessment of citation and quotation accuracy. Full-text copies of all original references were obtained by interlibrary loan methods and reviewed directly to establish citation accuracy. The presence of citation errors was determined by a single investigator. The relevance of citation errors was determined by assessing the ease of reference retrieval through PubMed. Quotation accuracy was determined by two examiners who reviewed each of the twenty articles and 200 references to compare the claims made for the references in the article against the data and opinions expressed in the actual reference. RESULTS The total citation error rate across all of the journals was 26 fifty-one of 200 references with a 95 confidence interval of 16.5 to 37.3. The median citation error rate per journal was 27 range 10 to 38. Although citation errors were common most were of minimal significance as 196 of the 200 references could be retrieved with ease from PubMed. The total quotation error rate across all of the articles was 38 152 of 398 reference citations with a 95 confidence interval of 30.1 to 47.0. The median quotation error rate per journal was 38 range 28 to 46. CONCLUSIONS Citation and quotation errors are common in the pediatric orthopaedic literature. Reference accuracy continues to be a substantial problem in the biomedical literature despite recent technological advances such as online databases easily accessible search engines and widely available bibliographic software.",

We measured immunoreactivity of collagen types I III and V to detect structural changes in the developing BMZ. To detect more dynamic functional components of the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit we evaluated the distribution of perlecan fibroblast growth factor-2 FGF-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 FGFR-1. One-month-old monkeys had a mean collagen BMZ width of 1.5 - 0.7 microm that increased to 4.4 - 0.4 microm in 6-mo-old monkeys. Perlecan was localized in the BMZ of the epithelium at all ages. FGF-2 was strongly expressed in basal cells at 1-3 mo. At 6 mo FGF-2 was expressed throughout the BMZ and weakly in basal cells. FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was expressed by basal cells and cilia and weakly in the nuclei of columnar cells at all time points. These data indicate that development of the BMZ is a postnatal event in the rhesus monkey that involves FGF-2.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS Roentgenograms of the hands lateral lumbar spine and knees were assessed in pairs 1984 and 1986 without knowledge of running status. Computerized scans of the first lumbar vertebrae were obtained to quantify bone mineral. RESULTS A decrease in bone density over the 2-year period was statistically significant for nearly all subjects especially for runners who decreased their running habits. At the 2-year follow-up runners maintained greater bone density. Progression of the roentgenographic scores for osteoarthritis demonstrated a statistically significant increase in almost all groups in this normative population over the 2-year period. Female runners had more spur formation in the weight-bearing knee roentgenograms than did control subjects. CONCLUSION With the possible exception of spur formation in women running did not appear to influence the development of radiologic osteoarthritis in the populations studied.",

We study a closely related definition of the amplituhedron for the simplest case of four-particle scattering given as a sum over complementary negative geometries which provides a natural geometric understanding of the exponentiation of infrared IR divergences as well as a new geometric definition of an IR finite observable Fg z dually interpreted as the expectation value of the null polygonal Wilson loop with a single Lagrangian insertion which is directly determined by these negative geometries. This provides a long-sought direct link between canonical forms for positive negative geometries and a completely IR finite post-loop-integration observable depending on a single kinematical variable z from which the cusp anomalous dimension cuspg can also be straightforwardly obtained. We study an especially simple class of negative geometries at all loop orders associated with a tree structure in the negativity conditions for which the contributions to Fg z and cusp can easily be determined by an interesting non-linear differential equation immediately following from the combinatorics of negative geometries. This lets us compute these tree contributions to Fg z and cusp for all values of the t Hooft coupling.

    "abstract": "Fleet control operation tools for high frequency bus service seek to maintain headway regularity between consecutive vehicles. Almost always these tools suggest a series of control actions that must be executed by drivers that are assumed to be identical in their driving behavior and that this behavior is identical in all driving contexts. However not all bus drivers drive in the same way and their behavior can be affected by different factors related to the environment in which they carry out their work. In this paper the behavioral difference is characterized by the average speed at which each of them drives along a given route. This work focuses on determining the impact of this heterogeneity on headway variability and on how erroneously considering drivers to be homogeneous impacts the performance of headway regularity control tools based on holding decisions. The results show that the reduction in waiting times when the holding control strategy is applied compared to the case without control increases when speed variability across drivers also increases. We show that an easy way of improving headway regularity is to stratify drivers by line according to historical driving speed regardless of whether or not a control action is applied.",

    "abstract": "Two families of carboxylic acid derivatives of the herbicides atrazine and simazine were synthesized for use as haptens in the development of immunoassays. One family was made by using monosubstituted alkylaminocyanuric chlorides and a variety of -amino acids giving spacers of varying lengths attached to one secondary amino group. The second family resulted from the replacement of the 2-chloro group of atrazine or simazine with 3-mercaptopropanoic acid. These haptens were conjugated to carrier proteins via N-hydroxysuccinimide active esters to make immunogens and ELISA antigens. Monoalkylaminocyanuric chlorides were also conjugated directly to bovine serum albumin and thyroglobulin under physiological conditions. ELISA and competitive inhibition ELISA results demonstrated that antibodies from immunized rabbits bound all of the conjugated and free s-triazines tested including the parent compounds atrazine and simazine. The degree of binding was dependent on the N-alkyl groups present and on the length and position of attachment of the spacer arm. These results illustrate the usefulness of this synthetic approach in easily producing immunogenic haptens for a class of compounds that are difficult to work with because of their low solubility. 1990 American Chemical Society.

STUDY DESIGN Experimental crossover design. ANIMALS Intact male hound-cross research colony dogs n4. METHODS All dogs received the 3 different bowel preparation protocols for CT pneumocolonography in the same order with a minimum of 2 weeks between protocols. For each segment of large bowel the subjective adequacy of bowel cleansing was assessed residual fecal and bowel volumes were calculated and the density of fecal material in the bowel lumen was measured. Linear mixed effect models that included a random dog effect were used to evaluate mean differences in outcome measures across protocols. RESULTS No dogs experienced any clinical problems associated with the protocols or CT pneumocolonography. Bowel cleansing was considered adequate for CT pneumocolonography interpretation for all 3 protocols. There was a significant effect of protocol on residual fecal volumes and the fecalbowel volume ratio with the 2 protocols that included an extended fast producing the lowest total residual fecal volumes. There was a significant effect of protocol on maximum measured density of residual fecal material with the 2 protocols including iodinated contrast having the highest density. CONCLUSIONS All protocols were sufficient for CT pneumocolonography interpretation and contrast-tagging of residual fecal material was successful with oral iopamidol administration. An at-home bowel cleansing protocol may provide adequate bowel cleansing for CT pneumocolonography image interpretation.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspBackgroundjatsp jatspOver the past decade research has demonstrated superior outcomes for adolescents and young adults AYAs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL when they are treated on pediatric versus adult ALL protocols which occurs more frequently at academic centers. We hypothesized that this knowledge resulted in a greater proportion of younger adults with ALL receiving treatment at National Cancer Institute NCIChildrens Oncology Group COG designated centers over the past decade and that an increased proportion of younger AYAs ages 18-21 received care at pediatric COG versus adult centers.jatsp jatspMethodsjatsp jatspWe used the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development patient discharge database to conduct a retrospective analysis of AYA patients with ALL ages 18 to 25 and diagnosed and treated in California from 2004 to 2013. The primary outcome was receiving care at a NCICOG designated center up to 5 years after diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine socio-demographic factors associated with AYAs ever receiving care from an NCICOG designated center. Descriptive analyses were used to evaluate changes in the percentage of admissions from NCI and COG designated centers over time using a chi-square test to make comparison of proportions over time.jatsp jatspResultsjatsp jatspThere were 703 patients ages 18-25 years 52.5 18-21 47.5 22-25 years who were newly diagnosed with ALL and hospitalized in California between 2004 and 2013. Sixty-five percent were male and 51 had private insurance. Of these patients 37 always received care at an NCICOG center while 28 sometimes and 35 never received care at these centers. Younger AYAs 18-21 years had a higher odds of ever being discharged from a NCICOG center OR 1.52 CI 1.10-2.10 while AYAs living farther from a NCICOG center were less likely to receive care at these centers OR 0.45 CI 0.27-0.76 for 10-20 vs 0-5 miles. Over the past decade there was an increase in the percentage of admissions to NCICOG centers among 18-21 year-olds 53 in 2004 to 72 in 2013 plt0.001 whereas there was no significant increase for 22-25 year-olds 44 in 2004 to 49 in 2013 p0.435 Figure. When admissions to an NCI and COG center were considered separately differences were observed by age group. There was a lower percentage of admissions to NCI centers over time in 18-21 year-olds 34 in 2004 to 27 in 2013 p0.183 but a significant increase in admissions to NCI centers in 22-25 year-olds 27 in 2004 to 40 in 2013 p0.035. Alternatively there was a significant increase in the percentage of admissions to COG centers in the 18-21 year-olds 48 to 67 plt0.001 with a somewhat smaller increase in admissions to COG centers in 22-25 year-olds 25 to 32 p0.278 from 2004 to 2013.jatsp jatspConclusionsjatsp jatspOver the past decade approximately 37 of younger 18-25 years AYAs with ALL always received care at NCICOG designated centers with younger age and shorter geographical distance to a NCICOG designated center being the main predictors for receiving care at these centers. Over the study period the percentage of admissions increased at NCI centers for 22-25 year-olds and COG centers for 18-21 year-olds. These findings support our hypothesis that there has been a shift in treatment of younger AYAs 18-21 years to COG designated centers over the past decade. Further research is warranted to determine the roles that referral patterns insurance networks patient preference and other barriers play in receiving care at NCI andor COG institutions and the effect of care at these centers on survival in population-based data.jatsp jatspFigure Percent of Admissions Ages 18 to 21 vs 22 to 25 at NCICOG Designated Centers with a Diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 2004 to 2013 Figure.

Total glycoside content reached a maximum in Muscat cultivars post-vraison but remained relatively constant in all other cultivars. Three types of monoterpenyl glycosides predominated in all samples malonylated monoterpenol glucosides monoterpenol hexose-pentoses and monoterpendiol hexose-pentoses. The two Muscat cultivars were not differentiated at the earlier developmental stages but could be differentiated post-vraison. In contrast similarities between Chardonnay and Pinot noir glycoside profiles developed post-vraison. Overall monoterpene glycoconjugation patterns may align with underlying genetic relationships among cultivars.

CLINICAL FINDINGS All patients were male breeds included Pug n 5 Chinese Shar-Pei 1 and Bullmastiff 1. Dyspnea and lethargy were the most common initial complaints with a duration of clinical signs ranging from 1 to 10 days. A CBC showed leukocytosis and neutrophilia in all dogs. Anemia was present in 6 dogs 2 of which received packed RBC transfusions. The diagnosis was made on the basis of results of thoracic radiography CT ultrasonography or a combination of modalities. The left cranial lung lobe was most commonly affected n 4 followed by the right middle lung lobe 2 and the right cranial lung lobe 1. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME A lateral intercostal thoracotomy with lobectomy of the affected lobe was performed in all patients. All dogs survived to be discharged between 1 and 2 days postoperatively. Six of 7 owners contacted for follow-up information 7 to 170 months after discharge reported satisfaction with the treatment and no apparent signs of recurrence of disease. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The juvenile patients of this report were successfully treated surgically with no apparent complications. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of lung lobe torsion when evaluating young dogs with clinical signs related to the respiratory system including those with vague signs to avoid undue delays in treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 FGFR3 is expressed in the growth plate of endochondral bones and serves as a negative regulator of linear bone elongation. Activating mutations severely limit bone growth resulting in dwarfism while inactivating mutations significantly enhance bone elongation and overall skeletal size. Domesticated dogs exhibit the greatest skeletal size diversity of any species and given the regulatory role of FGFR3 on growth plate proliferation we asked whether sequence differences in FGFR3 could account for some of the size differences. METHODS All exons the promoter region and 60 bp of the 3 flanking region of the canine FGFR3 gene were sequenced for nine different dog breeds representing a spectrum of skeletal size. The resultant sequences were compared to the reference Boxer genome sequence. RESULTS There was no variation in sequence for any FGFR3 exons promoter region or 3 flanking sequence across all breeds evaluated. CONCLUSION The results suggest that regardless of domestication selection pressure to develop breeds having extreme differences in skeletal size the FGFR3 gene is conserved. This implies a critical role for this gene in normal skeletal integrity and indicates that other genes account for size variability in dogs.",

There is an urgent need to quantify the likely severity and timing of such future acts shed light on likely perpetrators and identify intervention strategies. Here we present a combined analysis of multiple datasets across all these domains which account for 100000 events and show that a simple mathematical law can benchmark them all. We derive this benchmark and interpret it using a minimal mechanistic model grounded by state-of-the-art fieldwork. Our findings provide quantitative predictions concerning future attacks a tool to help detect common perpetrators and abnormal behaviors insight into the trajectory of a lone wolf identification of a critical threshold for spreading a message or idea among perpetrators an intervention strategy to erode the most lethal clusters and more broadly a quantitative starting point for cross-disciplinary theorizing about human aggression at the individual and group level in both real and online worlds.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Magnetic resonance imaging MRI can detect breast cancer in high-risk patients but is associated with a significant false-positive rate resulting in unnecessary breast biopsies. More data are needed to define the role of MRI screening for specific high-risk groups. We describe our experience with MRI screening in patients with atypical hyperplasia AH and lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data from our high-risk screening program prospective database for the period from April 1999 when screening MRI was first performed at our institution to July 2005. Patients with AH or LCIS demonstrated on previous surgical biopsy were identified. All patients underwent yearly mammography and twice yearly clinical breast examination. Additional screening MRI was performed at the discretion of the physician and patient. RESULTS We identified 378 patients 126 had AH and 252 had LCIS. Of these 182 48 underwent one or more screening MRIs mean 2.6 MRIs range 1-8 during this period whereas 196 52 did not. Those who had MRIs were younger P 0.001 with stronger family histories of breast cancer P 0.02. In MRI-screened patients 55 biopsies were recommended in 46182 25 patients with 4655 84 biopsies based on MRI findings alone. Cancer was detected in 646 13 MRI-generated biopsies. None of the six cancers detected on MRI were seen on recent mammogram. All six cancers were detected in five patients one with bilateral breast cancer with LCIS none were detected by MRI in the AH group. Thus cancer was detected in 5135 4 of patients with LCIS undergoing MRI. The yield of MRI screening overall was cancer detection in 646 13 biopsies 5182 3 MRI-screened patients and 5478 1 total MRIs done. In two additional MRI-screened patients cancer was detected by a palpable mass in one and on prophylactic surgery in the other and missed by all recent imaging studies. For 196 non-MRI-screened patients 21 11 underwent 22 biopsies during the same period. Eight of 22 36 biopsies yielded cancer in seven patients. All MRI-detected cancers were stage 0-I whereas all non-MRI cancers were stage I-II. CONCLUSION Patients with AH and LCIS selected to undergo MRI screening were younger with stronger family histories of breast cancer. MRI screening generated more biopsies for a large proportion of patients and facilitated detection of cancer in only a small highly selected group of patients with LCIS.",

    "abstract": "Cladosporium fulvum is a fungal pathogen that causes leaf mould of tomato. The reference genome of this pathogen was released in 2012 but its high repetitive DNA content prevented a contiguous assembly and further prohibited the analysis of its genome architecture. In this study we combined third generation sequencing technology with the Hi-C chromatin conformation capture technique to produce a high-quality and near complete genome assembly and gene annotation of a Race 5 isolate of C. fulvum. The resulting genome assembly contained 67.17 Mb organized into 14 chromosomes Chr1-to-Chr14 all of which were assembled telomere-to-telomere. The smallest of the chromosomes Chr14 is only 460 kb in size and contains 25 genes that all encode hypothetical proteins. Notably PCR assays revealed that Chr14 was absent in 19 out of 24 isolates of a world-wide collection of C. fulvum indicating that Chr14 is dispensable. Thus C. fulvum is currently the second species of Capnodiales shown to harbour dispensable chromosomes. The genome of C. fulvum Race 5 is 49.7 repetitive and contains 14 690 predicted genes with an estimated completeness of 98.9 currently one of the highest among the Capnodiales. Genome structure analysis revealed a compartmentalized architecture composed of gene-dense and repeat-poor regions interspersed with gene-sparse and repeat-rich regions. Nearly 39.2 of the C. fulvum Race 5 genome is affected by Repeat-Induced Point RIP mutations and evidence of RIP leakage toward non-repetitive regions was observed in all chromosomes indicating the RIP plays an important role in the evolution of this pathogen. Finally 345 genes encoding candidate effectors were identified in C. fulvum Race 5 with a significant enrichment of their location in gene-sparse regions in accordance with the two-speed genome model of evolution. Overall the new reference genome of C. fulvum presents several notable features and is a valuable resource for studies in plant pathogens.",

METHODS A retrospective study was performed on all ACI procedures performed from 2014 to 2017 at a single institution. Biopsies were derived from 2 groups osteochondral loose body verses the intercondylar notch. The viability yield identity potency and density were obtained from each sample in addition to basic demographics and concomitant injuries. A total of 12 patients with osteochondral loose bodies 14.6 SD2.9 and 20 patients 13.6 SD3.3 with intercondylar notch biopsies were evaluated for the study. RESULTS In the microscopic and histologic comparison there was no significant difference in viability 94 in the loose bodies and 93 in the intercondylar notch groups identity 7.4 d5L versus 6.3 d5L or yield. Minimum yield is presented as different units in Carticel 1.210 cellsvial and matrix-induced ACI 8500 relative fluorescent units products however there was no difference between groups and all samples were above the acceptable limit. Minimum identity value is recorded as d5L -2.00 and all samples were above this limit. In addition no sample had signs of contamination or endotoxin in either group. CONCLUSION These results demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining cartilage biopsies in ACI procedures that may limit short-term and long-term donor site morbidity.

Thus it is not known whether ATP GTP and acyl CoA esters regulate mitoKATP from the matrix or cytosolic side of the inner membrane nor whether they all act from the same side. The experiments reported in this paper provide an unambiguous answer to these questions. Electrophysiological experiments in bilayer membranes containing purified mitoKATP showed that current is blocked asymmetrically by ATP. K flux experiments using proteoliposomes containing purified mitoKATP showed that mitoKATP is unipolar with respect to regulation by Mg2 ATP GTP and palmitoyl CoA and that all of these ligands react on the same pole of the protein. This demonstration was made possible by the new finding that mitoKATP is 85-90 oriented inward or outward in liposomes depending on the presence or absence of Mg2 in the reconstitution buffer. K flux experiments in respiring rat liver mitochondria showed that mitoKATP was inhibited by palmitoyl CoA and activated by GTP when these agents were added to the external medium. Given that the inner membrane is impermeant to these ligands and that mitoKATP is unipolar with respect to nucleotide regulation it follows that the regulatory sites on mitoKATP face the cytosol.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies specific for the carboxyl-terminal regions of bombesin and of ranatensin were used to study the tissue distribution of substances immunochemically similar to these two peptides in three amphibian species. Brain extracts of Rana catesbeiana Rana pipiens and Xenopus laevis all contained considerable quantities of both types of immunoreactivity with measured concentrations as high as several hundred pmol per g tissue. The two antibodies used in this study had very low crossreactivity less than 1 by RIA with the other peptide. In addition gel filtration revealed different elution profiles for the two immunoreactive substances extracted from amphibian brains. Immunocytochemistry revealed differences in localization within nerve fibers and cell bodies and specific absorption by the appropriate peptide. Ranatensin-like peptides were also present in high concentrations in skin of the two Rana species but not in that of Xenopus. Bombesin-like peptides were more abundant in the stomach of all three species. Significant amounts of substance Pphylasaemin-like immunoreactivity also were detected in the brains of all three species. It is concluded that ranatensin-like peptides are not confined to the skin and can be included as central nervous system neuropeptides in amphibians. These two groups of peptides are not species-specific since both are found in brain and stomach of amphibians whose skin contains only ranatensin-like peptide or neither.",

We argue that the holographic entropy cone for an arbitrary number of parties can be reconstructed from more fundamental data determined solely by subadditivity of quantum entropy. We formulate certain conjectures about graph models of holographic entanglement for which we provide strong evidence and rigorously prove that they all imply that such a reconstruction is possible. Our conjectures except only for the weakest further imply that the necessary data is remarkably simple. In essence all one needs to know to reconstruct the holographic entropy cone is a certain subset of the extreme rays of this simpler subadditivity cone namely those which can be realized in holography. This recasting of the bewildering entanglement structure of geometric states into primal building blocks paves the way to distilling the essence of holography for the emergence of a classical bulk spacetime.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the ground state and critical temperature Tc phase diagrams of the classical and quantum S12 pyrochlore lattice with nearest-neighbor Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions DMI. We consider ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange interaction as well as direct and indirect DMI. At the classical level three ground states are found all-inall-out ferromagnetic and a locally ordered XY phase known as 5 which displays an accidental classical U1 degeneracy at the mean-field level. Quantum zero-point energy fluctuations computed to order 1S are found to lift the classical ground-state degeneracy and select the so-called 3 state out of the degenerate manifold in most parts of the 5 regime. Likewise thermal fluctuations treated classically at the Gaussian level entropically select the 3 state at T0. In contrast to this low-temperature state-selection behavior classical Monte Carlo simulations find that the system orders at Tc in the noncoplanar 2 state of 5 for antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and indirect DMI with a transition from 2 to 3 at a temperature T5Tc. The same method finds that the system orders via a single transition at Tc directly into the 3 state for most of the region with ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and indirect DMI. Such ordering behavior at Tc for the S12 quantum model is corroborated by high-temperature series expansion. To investigate the T0 quantum ground state of the model we apply the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group PFFRG. The quantum paramagnetic phase of the pure antiferromagnetic S12 Heisenberg model is found to persist over a finite region in the phase diagram for both direct or indirect DMI. Interestingly we find that a combined ferromagnetic Heisenberg and indirect DMI near the boundary of ferromagnetism and 5 antiferromagnetism may potentially realize a T0 quantum ground state lacking conventional magnetic order. Otherwise for the largest portion of the phase diagram PFFRG finds the same long-range ordered phases all-inall-out ferromagnetic and 5 as in the classical model.",

The sensor unit comprises 12 accelerometers two on each face of a cube. The location and direction of the sensors are determined so as to locally optimize the numerical conditioning of the system of governing kinematic equations. The orientational installation error of each sensor is identified by off-line iterative processing of the gravitational acceleration measurements made at a number of known orientations of the unit thus allowing subsequent calibration. Furthermore a novel procedure is developed through which the acceleration measurements can be used to directly determine the body angular velocity this results in a major accuracy improvement over similar works whereby the angular velocity is obtained via integrating the angular acceleration.

Plants were harvested at 3 5 and 7d after treatments. In the ACCase metabolism experiment resistant grain sorghum transformed 88 of quizalofop-ethyl to quizalofop while 91 of the inactive was converted to active form by the susceptible plants 3DAT. By 7DAT all inactive quizalofop-ethyl was converted to active quizalofop. In the ALS metabolism study two distinct metabolites were produced from rimsulfuron. Metabolism rate was similar between resistant lines TX430R and N223R in all harvest dates except at 7 DAT however more rapid metabolism were observed when resistant were compared with the susceptible genotypes TX430S and N223S. The percentage of recovered rimsulfuron 3DAT corresponded to 80 and 83 in the resistant compared to 87 in the susceptible grain sorghum. At 5DAT metabolism was near steady in all sorghum plants but by 7DAT resistant genotypes metabolized 4-12 more than the susceptible sorghum. Metabolism of rimsulfuron in ALS-resistant grain sorghum is an added mechanism that could help elevate the level of rimsulfuron resistance.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Although cigarette smoking remains the most common risk factor for heart disease among the young few studies have explored the relationship of smoking with heart disease mortality risk among young people. This prospective study assesses the risk and burden of all heart disease HD and coronary heart disease CHD mortality associated with smoking among younger adults from a nationally representative sample of the United States. METHOD National Health Interview Survey respondents data from 1997-2004 were linked to their death records through 2006. The analyses were restricted to individuals 18 to 44 years of age during follow up n 121284. Cox proportional hazard ratios HR were estimated with adjustment for sample weights and design effects. Attributable fractions AF of smoking were calculated. RESULTS After controlling for age race body mass index history of hypertension and diabetes and leisure time physical activity current smoking related CHD mortality HR was 14.6 95 confidence interval or CI 3.3-64.9 for females and 3.6 95 CI 1.2-10.4 for males. The HR for all HD mortality was 3.1 95 CI 1.3-7.6 for females and 2.4 95 CI 1.2-4.7 for males. The AF of smoking for CHD deaths for female and male were 0.58 and 0.54 respectively. The AF of all HD mortality was 0.31 for male and 0.32 for female. The mean estimates of all HD deaths attributable to smoking during 1997-2006 among this age group were 52214 of which 45147 were CHD deaths. CONCLUSION Even after adjustment for multiple risk factors and without addressing passive smoking our result showed a strong relationship between smoking and HD and CHD mortality among young adults that is likely causal.",

Of all attitudes analyzed Americans hold the most liberal attitudes toward women in politics with no gender gap and little educational difference on this issue. Attitudes toward familial roles have the largest educational gap but a small gender difference. The gender gap in attitudes toward working motherhood has persisted over time with women holding more egalitarian attitudes than men.

Although both types of liberalization can increase the cost-efficiency of lending in the liberalizing country the distinction arises because opening toward cross-border lending increases competitive pressures contestability in the credit market while takeovers do not.

    "abstract": "Farmers around the world must precisely manage nutrients applied to and removed from crop fields to maintain production and without causing nutrient pollution. This study is the first to quantify the baseline accuracy of current industry measurement protocols and achievable accuracy from intensifying protocols for measuring dry matter DM nitrogen N potassium K and phosphorus P yields from forage crops harvested for silage. The true DM and nutrient yields of three fields each of corn sorghum and small grain were intensively measured by weighing and sampling every truckload of harvested forage. Simulations quantified the accuracy of practical sampling protocols by repeatedly subsampling the complete dataset for each field to measure average truckload weight and average DM and nutrient concentrations. Then uncertainty was propagated to DM N P and K yield calculations using standard error equations. Yields measured using current industry protocols diverged from the true yields of some fields by more than 40 emphasizing the need for improved protocols. This study shows that improving average DM and nutrient concentration measurements is unlikely to improve accuracy of yield measurements if average load weight is not precisely measured. Accuracy did not come within 27 of true yields without weighing all truckloads on some fields even when DM and nutrient concentration measurements were perfectly accurate. Once all truckloads were weighed the timing of forage sample collection to measure average DM concentration had the greatest impact on accuracy precision improved by an average of 6.2 when 3 samples were evenly spaced throughout the harvest compared to the same number of consecutive samples. All crop fields are affected by within field variation in growing conditions that results in heterogeneity in DM and nutrient yield. Globally this study provides foundational methodology to quantitatively evaluate and improve yield measurement protocols that ultimately support sustainable crop production.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE We previously demonstrated lower early mortality for young adults YAs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL who received induction treatment at specialized cancer centers SCCs versus community hospitals. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of inpatient location of treatment throughout therapy on long-term survival complications and cost-associations that have not yet been evaluated at the population level. METHODS Using the California Cancer Registry linked to a hospitalization database we identified patients 0-39 years of age diagnosed with first primary ALL who received inpatient treatment between 1991 and 2014. Patients were classified as receiving all or part or none of their inpatient treatment at an SCC within 3 years of diagnosis. Inverse probability-weighted multivariable Cox regression models estimated the associations between location of treatment and sociodemographic and clinical factors with survival. We compared 3-year inpatient costs overall and per day by age group and location of care. RESULTS Eighty-four percent 0-18 years n 4549 of children and 36 of YAs 19-39 years n 683 received all treatment at SCCs. Receiving all treatment at an SCC was associated with superior leukemia-specific hazard ratio HR 0.76 95 CI 0.67 to 0.88 and overall survival HR 0.87 95 CI 0.77 to 0.97 in children and in YAs HR 0.71 95 CI 0.61 to 0.83 HR 0.70 95 CI 0.62 to 0.80 even after controlling for complications. The cost of inpatient care during the full course of therapy was higher in patients receiving all of their care at SCCs. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate that inpatient treatment at an SCC throughout therapy is associated with superior survival therefore strong consideration should be given to referring these patients to SCCs.",

    "abstract": "Two field studies were conducted in the San Joaquin Valley SJV of California in order to describe the association of arthropods and possible virus diseases with the plant canopy of early-season bush-trained fresh-market tomato Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Shady Lady over three soil surface microenvironments. The experimental treatments were based on alterations to planting bed surfaces as follow 1 soil covered with silver metalized light-reflective plastic mulch 2 soil covered with biological mulch consisting of killed chopped cool-season cover crop residues mixture of triticale X Triticosecale Wittm. rye Secale cereale L. cv. Merced and common vetch Vicia sativa L. or 3 bare soil not covered - the SJV standard tomato production practice. In both studies the predominant arthropods encountered in all treatments were the aphid species Aphis craccivora Koch Macrosiphum euphorbiae Thomas and Myzus persicae Sulzer the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande and the false chinch bug Nysius raphanus Howard. These are all considered to be pests of cultivated tomato plants. Spiders were the most prevalent arthropod predator group recovered from foliage samples. All monitored arthropods except spiders were most abundant in tomato plants grown over the conventional bare soil surface and least abundant P 0.05 in plants grown over the silver plastic mulch. Spider numbers were highest in plant foliage over the biological mulch. Other arthropods commonly found on tomato plants in the SJV including leafhoppers whiteflies various caterpillars and predaceous taxa were not commonly nor consistently encountered. This was likely due to the early-season timeframe of these studies. Similarly foliar virus disease symptoms which were originally targeted for monitoring were virtually nonexistent. The only arthropod pest species encountered which consistently caused economically important damage to tomato fruit was N. raphanus. In both experiments tomato fruits grown over the reflective plastic mulch had significantly less 69.5 and 39.7 respectively damage due to this pest than those over bare soil. The biological mulch gave inconsistent intermediate damage reductions. Results from these two field studies showed that reflective plastic bed mulch suppressed populations of a variety of tomato canopy-associated arthropod taxa in early-season plantings as compared to conventional bare-soil beds. The biological bed mulch results were more inconsistent but gave indications that killed cover crop residues as well as the light-reflective plastic may be of value in integrated pest management programs for fresh-market tomato production. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To characterize the ophthalmic clinical and multimodal imaging findings of disseminated Mycobacterium chimaera infection after cardiothoracic surgery. DESIGN Observational case series. PARTICIPANTS Four patients 8 eyes with disseminated M. chimaera infection. METHODS Patients were evaluated with biomicroscopy OCT and OCT angiography fundus autofluorescence and fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical and multimodal imaging findings of patients with disseminated M. chimaera infection. RESULTS All 4 patients were white men with a mean age of 65.5 years range 60-75 years who had aortic valve or root infection or both with M. chimaera diagnosed by culture gene sequencing or both. All 4 patients demonstrated bilateral choroidal lesions on funduscopy and evidence of osteomyelitis by imaging culture analysis or both at the time of ocular diagnosis. Indocyanine green and OCT angiography revealed numerous additional subclinical choroidal lesions and were used to track disease response to therapy. Fluorescein angiography and fundus autofluorescence were useful in determining lesion age and activity. All patients were treated with 3- or 4-drug antimycobacterial therapy. Three underwent revision of cardiothoracic surgery with removal of infected graft. One patient went on to demonstrate progressive ocular disease that was noted before each of his surgical revisions. Two patients showed improvement in ocular and systemic disease however one of them developed a choroidal neovascular membrane. The final patient was a single encounter whose clinical and imaging findings showed longstanding inactive disease. CONCLUSIONS Ophthalmologists should be aware of the systemic and ocular findings of this rare life-threatening disease. Multimodal imaging is useful in corroborating a diagnosis of ocular M. chimaera and particularly in evaluating patient response to therapy because choroidal activity seems to mimic systemic activity. Treating physicians should be aware of the co-occurrence of choroiditis and osteomyelitis. Choroidal neovascular membrane can also be a late complication of this disease.",

OBJECTIVE To examine the association of WMHV cerebral infarcts and TBV with global cognition and cognition in 5 separate domains in a biracial population sample. SETTING A biracial community population of Chicago Illinois. DESIGN Cross-sectional population study. PARTICIPANTS The study population comprised 575 participants from the Chicago Health and Aging Project CHAP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging MRI measures of WMHV TBV and cerebral infarcts and detailed neuropsychological testing assessments of global cognition and 5 cognitive domains. RESULTS Overall and among those without dementia cognition was inversely associated with WMHV and number of infarcts but was positively associated with TBV. When all 3 measures were simultaneously added to the model the association of global cognition with WMHV and TBV remained significant and unchanged but was no longer significant with infarcts. Among subjects without dementia all 3 MRI measures were associated with performance in multiple cognitive domains specifically perceptual speed. However among subjects with dementia only TBV was associated with cognition and performance in multiple cognitive systems. Race did not significantly modify any of these associations. CONCLUSIONS In this biracial general population sample the associations of MRI measures with cognition differed according to clinical status of subjects stronger among subjects without dementia and were not modified by race. These associations did not affect all cognitive domains equally but were more consistent with impairments in perceptual speed.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To assess the optimum probe design and treatment parameters for transscleral diode laser retinopexy. METHODS Transscleral diode photocoagulation was performed on the eyes of Dutch-belted rabbits using three different transscleral probes a straight 400-microns diameter probe a prism-tipped 400-microns diameter probe and a prism-tipped 900-microns diameter probe. RESULTS Transscleral diode photocoagulation with all three probe types was an effective method of ablating the retina and creating chorioretinal adhesions. Both the burn diameter and the mean radiant output energy requirement increased as the burn duration and probe aperture diameter was increased. Explosive retinal holes were encountered in 12 of the burns created with the straight probe. The use of the prism-tipped probes significantly reduced the incidence of retinal holes to 4 P 0.005. Histopathologically all burns were grade III in intensity with severe choroidal injury. In many of the burns there was histopathologic evidence of thermal injury to the inner sclera. The frequency of these inner scleral changes was reduced with a long burn duration 5 seconds. CONCLUSION This study confirms that diode transscleral photocoagulation is a feasible method of thermal retinopexy. The use of the prism-tipped probes and long duration burns resulted in the fewest adverse reactions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND An important reason for young surgeons entering academic practice is to educate trainees. As clinical and administrative responsibility increases teaching time is decreased. We attempted to determine if the teaching performance of surgeons declines with career advancement. METHODS Between July 1998 and June 2002 all faculty at our institution were evaluated by medical students on the surgical clerkship. Surgeons were scored on clinical teaching CLINIC operating room teaching OR and overall teaching ALL with the use of a 4-point scale. Surgeons were grouped by years in practice group scores were compared with ANOVA. RESULTS A total of 6345 evaluations were completed on 74 academic surgeons. Junior surgeons or 5 years performed better in operating room teaching P .001 clinical teaching P.001 and overall teaching P .001 compared with those in practice more than 5 years. When junior surgeons were compared with the most senior faculty or 15 years the difference in all categories was even greater P .001. Tenure status had no relationship to teaching ability. CONCLUSIONS Junior faculty surgeons were perceived to be more effective teachers when compared to senior faculty. With career advancement faculty may devote less energy to teaching and become less effective. Therefore continued emphasis should be placed on strengthening education skills throughout the surgical career.",

They offer a source of recreation but also pose a risk for severe burns. The rising number of children with campfire burns seen at our institution triggered a quest for a campaign for the prevention of these injuries. A chart review was performed to study the characteristics and the circumstances of burn injuries of all children treated for campfire-related injuries over a 4-year period between 1997 and 2001. Thirty-two children sustained campfire-related burn injuries with 88 being under the age of 7. The children had either fallen into the campfire or walked into simmering coals. All accidents would have been prevented if the children had kept a safe distance from the campfire. Normal growth charts were used to determine the average height of 7-year-old children as being 48 inches. A campaign was started to encourage families to keep a safe distance of 4 feet from their campfires by drawing a circle of safety with a stick on the ground 4 feet away from the fire.",

    "abstract": "A population of infectious bursal disease virus IBDV in northeast Ohio that appears to be geographically restricted was identified. Thirteen broiler farms containing a total of 36 houses were examined for the presence of IBDV. Twenty-four of the 36 houses were positive for IBDV and of those viruses 15 viruses from six different broiler farms formed a unique phylogenetic group. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified glutamic acid E at position 253 in all 15 viruses. Only one other virus in the GenBank database contained this mutation and it was also from northeast Ohio. All 15 viruses from this study and the one identified in GenBank also had a unique VP1 sequence. The amino acids located at position 253 in VP2 are typically histidine attenuated viruses and glutamine pathogenic viruses. Because amino acid 253 has been linked to pathogenicity in IBDV two viruses from the E253 population were selected for pathogenicity studies. They were observed to be pathogenic in 4-wk-old specific-pathogen-free layer chicks. When these two viruses were used to challenge broilers from the parent flock that supplies the birds to all 13 broiler farms examined in this study the viruses were able to break through the maternal immunity at 14 and 21 days of age but not at 7 days of age. A similar scenario was observed on the six broiler farms that had these viruses. The phylogeographic data suggest this population of IBDV has been restricted for more than 14 yr to northeast Ohio. Because commercially available classic and variant vaccines do not effectively control this population of IBDV other alternatives are needed.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of Internet-of-Things IoT devices not only brings convenience but also poses numerous challenging safety and security issues. IoT devices are distributed highly heterogeneous and more importantly directly interact with the physical environment. In IoT systems the bugs in device firmware the defects in network protocols and the design flaws in system configurations all may lead to catastrophic accidents causing severe threats to peoples lives and properties. The challenge gets even more escalated as the possible attacks may be chained together in a long sequence across multiple layers rendering the current vulnerability analysis inapplicable. In this paper we present ForeSee a cross-layer formal framework to comprehensively unveil the vulnerabilities in IoT systems. ForeSee generates a novel attack graph that depicts all of the essential components in IoT from low-level physical surroundings to high-level decision-making processes. The corresponding graph-based analysis then enables ForeSee to precisely capture potential attack paths. An optimization algorithm is further introduced to reduce the computational complexity of our analysis. The illustrative case studies show that our multilayer modeling can capture threats ignored by the previous approaches.",

FISH revealed that nine of the patients had a t1221 which had not been previously detected. The nine patients were all children seven boys and two girls aged 1-10 years median 3 years had an early B immunophenotype and achieved complete remission although two of them experienced haematological relapse. In addition to the t1221 FISH also revealed that three of the nine had a del12p in the other homolog of chromosome 12 or in the der12 chromosome itself and that two others had 12p translocations in the other chromosome 12 homolog. Although chromosomal rearrangements associated with the t1221 were heterogenous and complex fusion of the sequences from chromosomes 12 and 21 on the der21t1221 chromosomes was consistent suggesting that the TEL-AML1 gene fusion on the der21 chromosome may be critical in leukaemogenesis and that FISH or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR targeted to the chimaeric sequences on the der21 will be most useful in detecting the t1221 or following a patient with the t1221 which is one of the most frequent chromosomal rearrangements in both Caucasian and Asian childhood ALL.",

Understanding the challenges needs and opportunities in each region is essential to guide research policy and marketing strategies for the strawberry industry across the country and to enable the development of general and region-specific educational and production tools. This review divided the United States into eight distinct geographic regions and an indoor controlled or protected environment production system. Current production systems markets cultivars trends and future directions for each region are discussed. A common trend across all regions is the increasing use of protected culture strawberry production with both day-neutral and short-day cultivars for season extension to meet consumer demand for year-round availability. All regions experience challenges with pests and obtaining adequate harvest labor. Increasing consumer demand for berries climate change-induced weather variability high pesticide use labor and immigration policies and land availability impact regional production thus facilitating the adoption of new technologies such as robotics and network communications to assist with strawberry harvesting in open-field production and production under controlled-environment agriculture and protected culture.",

    "abstract": "Soil-borne disease management in California strawberry production systems has historically relied upon pre-plant soil fumigation. Restricted efficacy of currently available fumigant chemistries towards certain pathogens and regulatory action requiring increased buffer zones has stimulated interest in development of alternative disease control strategies. Anaerobic soil disinfestation ASD demonstrates activity toward an array of soil-borne pathogens however there exist limited field-scale trials examining efficacy in strawberry systems. Multiple mechanisms including the activity of an altered soil microbiome are reported to function in ASD-induced disease suppression but consistency of the microbial response across soils has not been examined. The present research reports ASD-induced changes in composition of the soil microbiome which occurred in a carbon input-dependent manner and were consistent in two of the three field trials conducted. At all three field sites ASD treatments that transformed the microbiome were consistently associated with enhanced strawberry yields but specific compositional attributes of the microbiome in effective treatments were not uniform among all sites. Enhanced yields were associated with control of specific soil-borne pathogens at a given site however disease control was not uniformly attained across all pathogens resident to a given soil system. Findings demonstrate that informed selection of substrate to be used in ASD and knowledge of the targeted pathogen profile resident to the strawberry field soil will be essential to successful use of ASD in commercial agricultural production settings.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE In 2016 Kaiser Permanente Northern California regionalized gastric cancer care introducing a regional comprehensive multidisciplinary care team standardizing staging and chemotherapy and implementing laparoscopic gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy for patients eligible for curative-intent surgery. This study evaluated the effect of regionalization on outcomes. METHODS The retrospective cohort study included gastric cancer cases diagnosed from January 2010 to May 2018. Information was obtained from the electronic medical record cancer registry state vital statistics and chart review. Overall survival was compared in patients with all stages of disease stage I-III disease and curative-intent gastrectomy patients using annual inception cohorts. For the latter the surgical approach and surgical outcomes were also compared. RESULTS Among 1429 eligible patients with gastric cancer with all stages of disease one third were treated after regionalization 650 had stage I-III disease and 394 underwent curative-intent surgery. Among surgical patients neoadjuvant chemotherapy utilization increased from 35 to 66 P .0001 laparoscopic gastrectomy increased from 18 to 92 P .0001 and D2 lymphadenectomy increased from 2 to 80 P .0001. Dissection of 15 lymph nodes increased from 61 to 95 P .0001. Surgical complication rates did not appear to increase after regionalization. Length of hospitalization decreased from 7 to 3 days P .001. Overall survival at 2 years was as follows all stages 32.8 pre and 37.3 post P .20 stage I-III cases with or without surgery 55.6 and 61.1 respectively P .25 and among surgery patients 72.7 and 85.5 respectively P .03. CONCLUSION Regionalization of gastric cancer care within an integrated system allowed comprehensive multidisciplinary care conversion to laparoscopic gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy increased overall survival among surgery patients and no increase in surgical complications.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient in irrigated rice Oryza sativa L. production and growers continue to be faced with the challenge of meeting crop N demand particularly in organic production systems. The main objective of this study was to determine how rice yield was affected by seasonal availability of N from organic sources under continuously and noncontinuously flooded conditions. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the commonly used poultry litter pelletized organic fertilizers blood meat and feather meal 13-0-0 feather meal 12-0-0 poultry litter plus feather meal 6-3-2 and NH 4 2SO 4 in synchronizing the supply of mineralized N with the demand of N by rice. The N mineralization of all organic fertilizers occurred primarily during the first 53 d after planting results which were confirmed subsequently in a laboratory incubation study. In all fields fertilizers increased grain yield and N uptake relative to a zero N control. Relative to poultry litter the pelletized fertilizers resulted in higher yields 9980 vs. 9267 kg ha -1 N uptake 140 vs. 114 kg ha -1 and N recovery efficiency 35 vs. 20 in all fields. It was concluded that pelletized fertilizers were significantly more effective than poultry litter in supplying N to the crop when fields were continuously flooded. In contrast all organic fertilizers were less effective in supplying N when fields were drained for weed control due to lower N recovery efficiency 26 and N loss through denitrify cation indicating that organic fertilizer application may not be economically viable under such circumstances. 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy.

    "abstract": "CASE DESCRIPTION 6 lactating dairy goats were examined because of acute mastitis. CLINICAL FINDINGS Goats were considered to have endotoxemia on the basis of physical examination and clinicopathologic findings. The affected udder halves had gangrenous discolored distal portions with sharp demarcations from grossly normal tissue proximally. Udder secretions from the affected sides were serosanguineous in all cases. A Bacillus sp was isolated in pure cultures in all cases. In 1 case the Bacillus sp was identified as Bacillus cereus. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Goats were treated for mastitis and endotoxemia with polyionic IV fluid therapy systemic and intramammary antimicrobial administration anti-inflammatory drug administration and other supportive treatment. All goats survived to discharge. All except 1 goat had follow-up information available. The affected udder halves sloughed in 1 to 2 months following discharge. In subsequent lactations after the mastitis episodes milk production in 2 of 5 goats was above the mean as determined on the basis of Dairy Herd Improvement records and 3 of 5 goats were voluntarily withdrawn from lactation. All 5 goats had successful kiddings after the Bacillus mastitis episode. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Bacillus sp should be considered as a causative agent in goats with gangrenous mastitis especially when the Bacillus sp is isolated in a pure culture. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing is recommended for selection of an appropriate antimicrobial for treatment. Prognosis for survival appears to be good although milk production may be decreased.",

SAMPLE POPULATION 12 cadaveric canine right forelimbs. PROCEDURE Transarticular force maps were created by placing a tactile array pressure sensor into the elbow joint cavity and loading cadaveric forelimbs in a materials testing system. Mean joint forces were determined at loads of 50 100 150 and 200 N. RESULTS All tests produced 2 distinct areas of high load that corresponded with the proximal articular surfaces of the radius and ulna. Mean forces for the radial proximal articular surface were slightly but significantly greater than for the ulna averaging 51 to 52 of total force for all applied loads. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The proximal articular surface of the ulna contributes substantially to load transfer through the canine elbow joint. Abnormalities which increase this load might contribute to canine elbow joint dysplasia specifically fragmentation of the medial coronoid process and osteochondritis dissecans of the medial aspect of the humeral condyle. In the treatment of these conditions the normal force distribution within the canine elbow joint should be taken into consideration.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE The association of adverse childhood experiences ACEs with negative health outcomes is well established and the concept of allostatic load has been proposed as a possible causal mechanism. Most studies measure conventional household ACE exposures without accounting for non-conventional community ACE exposures which may underrepresent the adversity experienced by racialethnic minorities. We address this gap by calculating the prevalence of both types of ACE exposures for racialethnic subgroups. We also examine associations of ACE exposures and emotional regulation in school aged children and youth. DESIGN AND METHODS This study used data n 65680 for a nationally representative sample of children ages 6 to 17 years in the National Survey of Childrens Health 2011-2012. Confirmatory factor analysis descriptive statistics and regression models were used to examine the relationships between ACEs and emotional regulation. RESULTS Community level ACE events disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. Some but not all ACEs were significantly and inversely associated with the ability to emotionally regulate in children. Experiencing racism had the strongest negative effect of all ACE variables. The strength of the child-caregiver relationship was associated with increased odds of emotional regulation independent of exposure to ACEs. CONCLUSIONS The study supports the need to refine and expand ACE health screenings to fully capture the adversity faced by all children. Emotional regulation is identified as a possible intervention point. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Expansion of programs that strengthen the child-caregiver relationship and reduce ACEs in early childhood may be a key approach to increasing coping abilities in youth.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The infraorder Mygalomorphae i.e. trapdoor spiders tarantulas funnel web spiders etc. is one of three main lineages of spiders. Comprising 15 families 325 genera and over 2600 species the group is a diverse assemblage that has retained a number of features considered primitive for spiders. Despite an evolutionary history dating back to the lower Triassic the group has received comparatively little attention with respect to its phylogeny and higher classification. The few phylogenies published all share the common thread that a stable classification scheme for the group remains unresolved. METHODS AND FINDINGS We report here a reevaluation of mygalomorph phylogeny using the rRNA genes 18S and 28S the nuclear protein-coding gene EF-1 and a morphological character matrix. Taxon sampling includes members of all 15 families representing 58 genera. The following results are supported in our phylogenetic analyses of the data 1 the Atypoidea i.e. antrodiaetids atypids and mecicobothriids is a monophyletic group sister to all other mygalomorphs and 2 the families Mecicobothriidae Hexathelidae Cyrtaucheniidae Nemesiidae Ctenizidae and Dipluridae are not monophyletic. The Microstigmatidae is likely to be subsumed into Nemesiidae. Nearly half of all mygalomorph families require reevaluation of generic composition and placement. The polyphyletic family Cyrtaucheniidae is most problematic representing no fewer than four unrelated lineages. CONCLUSIONS Based on these analyses we propose the following nomenclatural changes 1 the establishment of the family Euctenizidae NEW RANK 2 establishment of the subfamily Apomastinae within the Euctenizidae and 3 the transfer of the cyrtaucheniid genus Kiama to Nemesiidae. Additional changes include relimitation of Domiothelina and Theraphosoidea and the establishment of the Euctenizoidina clade Idiopidae Euctenizidae. In addition to these changes we propose a road map for future sampling across the infraorder with the aim of solving many remaining questions that hinder mygalomorph systematics.",

    "abstract": "The actual inner workings of a fuel cell are fairly well known as are the performance maps of the devices composing the balance of plant. It is the interaction of these devices as controlled by the fuel cell engines control strategy which introduces variability to fuel cell engine performance. The control strategy must be able to meet the conditions required for efficient stack operation under all operating conditions associated with a potential application. A Nexa commercial fuel cell engine was selected in order that the findings of this study may be immediately relevant. In the present study changes in the Nexas performance are investigated by varying the ambient temperature and relative humidity. Our experiments showed that the ambient temperature directly affects the heat exchanger fan power consumption and the maximum power with a statistically significant effect on net efficiency. The ambient relative humidity played a statistically insignificant role in determining the net efficiency of the Nexa. However the increased frequency and duration of the anode purges indicate an evidence that flooding was beginning to occur which suggests that the Nexas water management control strategy is not aggressive enough to deal with high-temperature and high-humidity conditions. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

    "abstract": "ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis ASCA was applied to short-wave infrared spectral fingerprints of 5 malting barley varieties collected using a hyperspectral imaging system to determine the effect of germination the influence of time and the influence of barley by means of a full factorial experimental design. ASCA indicated that there was a significant p 0.0001 effect of the germination status the germination time and interaction on the spectral data for all varieties. The biochemical and physiological modification of the samples were characterised by visualisation of the longitudinal scores obtained from simultaneous component analysis for the germination time factor. This resulted in the visualisation and explanation of biochemical change over the course of barley germination as a factor of time. The relevant loadings indicated a significant change to the proteome lipid and starch structure as driven by the uptake of water over time. The ASCA model were extrapolated to include the effect of barley variety to the already mentioned germination status and germination time factors resulting once again in all the effects being significant p 0.0001. Here it was shown that all the barley varieties are significantly different from one another pre- and post-modification based on the molecular vibrations observed in the short wave-infrared SWIR spectra suggesting that the detection of biotic stress factors such as pre-harvest germination also differ for each variety by indicating that the germination profile of each barley variety varies as a function of germination time. Thus also the malting performance germinative energy and chemical profile of each barley variety tested will vary before during and after imbibition and germination - indicating the importance of malting commercial barley malt true to variety. These results indicate that SWIR spectral imaging instrumentation can possibly be used to monitor controlled germination of barley grain. Due to the shown ability of SWIR spectral imaging to detect small biochemical changes over time of barley grain during germination.",

    "abstract": "In plants prolonged dormancy is often considered a response to resource depletion or environmental stress that comes at a fitness cost. However apparent costs of dormancy could reflect the state in which plants entered dormancy rather than effects of dormancy per se. We tested this hypothesis for a terrestrial orchid Epipactis atrorubens by analyzing differences in vital rates of dormant and emergent plants using generalized linear mixed models applied to eight years of demographic data. Dormant E. atrorubens plants did not form one homogeneous stage class. Instead the vital rates of dormant plants mirrored performance of plants in their life stage before dormancy. Plants emerging from dormancy were slightly albeit only marginally statistically significantly larger than plants transitioning from the matching aboveground stage class especially for smaller and younger stage classes. Because small plants were most likely to go dormant plants emerging from dormancy were also smaller than average if one were to compare all previously dormant plants to all previously emergent plants. Therefore misclassifying all dormant plants into a single stage class changes whether we view dormancy as intrinsically costly in terms of future performance upon emergence. We suggest that prolonged dormancy may be a form of phenotypic plasticity in which plants distribute their performance and reproductive effort through time rather than a simple stress response.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the level of pain elicited by mammary fat pad removal surgery and the effects of postoperative analgesics on recovery. Female FVB mice were anesthetized and mammary fat pad removal was performed. After surgery mice received carprofen buprenorphine a combination of carprofen and buprenorphine or saline treatment. Additional mice received anesthesia but no surgery or treatment. Food and water intake body weight wheel running activity and a visual assessment score were recorded daily for 4 d after surgery and compared with presurgical findings. Corticosterone metabolites in fecal samples were analyzed at 12 and 24 h postsurgically and compared with baseline values. All surgical groups had significantly decreased food intake at 24 h with a return to baseline by 48 h. The combination treatment resulted in a significantly decreased water intake and body weight at 24 h. All surgical groups had significantly decreased wheel running activity at 24 h only. The visual assessment scores indicated mild pain for all surgical groups with the buprenorphine treated mice showing the highest pain index scores as compared with nonsurgical controls. Fecal corticosterone metabolite levels did not differ significantly between any of the groups or across time. The parameters used in this study did not indicate that administration of these analgesic regimens improved recovery as compared with that of saline-treated mice. Care should be taken when using visual assessment scores to evaluate pain in mice given that analgesics may have side effects that inadvertently elevate the score.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Virtually all existing evidence linking access to firearms to elevated risks of mortality and morbidity comes from ecological and case-control studies. To improve understanding of the health risks and benefits of firearm ownership we launched a cohort study the Longitudinal Study of Handgun Ownership and Transfer LongSHOT. METHODS Using probabilistic matching techniques we linked three sources of individual-level state-wide data in California official voter registration records an archive of lawful handgun transactions and all-cause mortality data. There were nearly 28.8 million unique voter registrants 5.5 million handgun transfers and 3.1 million deaths during the study period 18 October 2004 to 31 December 2016. The linkage relied on several identifying variables first middle and last names date of birth sex residential address that were available in all three data sets deploying them in a series of bespoke algorithms. RESULTS Assembly of the LongSHOT cohort commenced in January 2016 and was completed in March 2019. Approximately three-quarters of matches identified were exact matches on all link variables. The cohort consists of 28.8 million adult residents of California followed for up to 12.2 years. A total of 1.2 million cohort members purchased at least one handgun during the study period and 1.6 million died. CONCLUSIONS Three steps taken early may be particularly useful in enhancing the efficiency of large-scale data linkage thorough data cleaning assessment of the suitability of off-the-shelf data linkage packages relative to bespoke coding and careful consideration of the minimum sample size and matching precision needed to support rigorous investigation of the study questions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND There is conflicting evidence in the literature on the association between elevated serum B12 concentrations and subsequent disease or mortality. We evaluated in the NHANES general population the association of serum B12 concentrations as well as vitamin B12 supplement intake with all-cause cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality while taking into account demographic and lifestyle factors and significant other diseases which are known to be associated with poorer outcome. METHODS The main outcomes of our study were all-cause mortality cardiovascular mortality and cancer-related mortality. Mortality status and cause of death were determined by NHANES-linked National Death Index public access files through December 31 2015. The association of serum B12 concentrations and vitamin B12 supplement intake with mortality was assessed with Cox proportional hazard PH models with adjustment for a number of relevant demographic and lifestyle factors and comorbidity. RESULTS The final study population of 24262 participants had a mean age of 48 SD 19 years 50.1 were males. The median follow-up duration was 109 months range 1-201 months. On the census day of December 31 2015 3023 participants were determined as deceased 12.5. The fully adjusted Cox PH model indicated that low serum B12 concentrations 140 pmoll were associated with a small increase in all-cause hazard ratio HR 1.39 95 CI 1.08-1.78 p 0.011 and cardiovascular HR 1.64 95 CI 1.08-2.47 p 0.020 mortality. Similarly high serum B12 concentrations 700 pmoll were associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality only HR 1.45 95 CI 1.01-2.06 p 0.042. Participants with a diagnosis of hypertension dyslipidemia CVD and cancer more frequently used vitamin B12-containing supplements than those without these diagnoses. We could not demonstrate an association between vitamin B12 supplement intake and mortality when adjusted for comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS In the general population of NHANES low serum B12 concentrations were associated with a moderate increase in all-cause mortality. There was a small but significant increase in cardiovascular mortality in the groups with low or high serum B12. High intake of vitamin B12 in the form of supplements was not associated with any adverse effect on mortality and therefore can be regarded as safe.",

    "abstract": "In a previous article Beschta et al. Environ Manag 512474-491 2013 argue that grazing by large ungulates both native and domestic should be eliminated or greatly reduced on western public lands to reduce potential climate change impacts. The authors did not present a balanced synthesis of the scientific literature and their publication is more of an opinion article. Their conclusions do not reflect the complexities associated with herbivore grazing. Because grazing is a complex ecological process synthesis of the scientific literature can be a challenge. Legacy effects of uncontrolled grazing during the homestead era further complicate analysis of current grazing impacts. Interactions of climate change and grazing will depend on the specific situation. For example increasing atmospheric CO and temperatures may increase accumulation of fine fuels primarily grasses and thus increase wildfire risk. Prescribed grazing by livestock is one of the few management tools available for reducing fine fuel accumulation. While there are certainly points on the landscape where herbivore impacts can be identified there are also vast grazed areas where impacts are minimal. Broad scale reduction of domestic and wild herbivores to help native plant communities cope with climate change will be unnecessary because over the past 20-50 years land managers have actively sought to bring populations of native and domestic herbivores in balance with the potential of vegetation and soils. To cope with a changing climate land managers will need access to all available vegetation management tools including grazing.",

Given the low frequency of LG in human and veterinary medicine specific diagnostic criteria are lacking. Here we describe 14 cases of canine LG that were retrospectively identified from 6 academic institutions. The mean age of affected dogs was 7.3 years and over 90 of patients were brachycephalic. Clinical signs were variable and progressive. Relevant magnetic resonance image findings in 714 dogs included meningeal enhancement of affected areas andor intraparenchymal masses. All affected dogs were euthanized because of the poor prognosis. Gross changes were reported in 1214 cases and consisted mainly of gelatinous leptomeningeal thickening in the brain 612 cases or spinal cord 212 cases and 1 or multiple gelatinous gray to red intraparenchymal masses in the brain 612 cases. Histologically all leptomeningeal neoplasms and intraparenchymal gliomas were morphologically consistent with oligodendrogliomas. Widespread nuclear immunolabeling for OLIG2 was observed in all neoplasms. The absence of an intraparenchymal glioma was consistent with PLG in 3 cases. The remaining 11 cases were diagnosed as SLG.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the Halorhodospira halophila Hhal photoactive yellow protein PYP is not representative of the greater PYP family. The photodynamics of the PYP isolated from Salinibacter ruber Srub is characterized with a comprehensive range of spectroscopic techniques including ultrafast transient absorption photostationary light titrations Fourier transform infrared and cryokinetics spectroscopies. We demonstrate that the dark-adapted pG state consists of two subpopulations differing in the protonation state of the chromophore and that both are photoactive with the protonated species undergoing excited-state proton transfer. However the primary I0 photoproduct observed in the Hhal PYP photocycle is absent in the Srub PYP photodynamics which indicates that this intermediate while important in Hhal photodynamics is not a critical intermediate in initiating all PYP photocycles. The excited-state lifetime of Srub PYP is the longest of any PYP resolved to date 30 ps which we ascribe to the more constrained chromophore binding pocket of Srub PYP and the absence of the critical Arg52 residue found in Hhal PYP. The final stage of the Srub PYP photocycle involves the slowest known thermal dark reversion of a PYP 40 min vs 350 ms in Hhal PYP. This property allowed the characterization of a pH-dependent equilibrium between the light-adapted pB state with a protonated cis chromophore and a newly resolved pG intermediate with a deprotonated cis chromophore and pG-like protein conformation. This result demonstates that protein conformational changes and chromophore deprotonation precede chromophore reisomerization during the thermal recovery of the PYP photocycle.",

    "abstract": "Infection with Zika virus ZIKV is associated with human congenital fetal anomalies. To model fetal outcomes in nonhuman primates we administered Asian-lineage ZIKV subcutaneously to four pregnant rhesus macaques. While non-pregnant animals in a previous study contemporary with the current report clear viremia within 10-12 days maternal viremia was prolonged in 3 of 4 pregnancies. Fetal head growth velocity in the last month of gestation determined by ultrasound assessment of head circumference was decreased in comparison with biparietal diameter and femur length within each fetus both within normal range. ZIKV RNA was detected in tissues from all four fetuses at term cesarean section. In all pregnancies neutrophilic infiltration was present at the maternal-fetal interface decidua placenta fetal membranes in various fetal tissues and in fetal retina choroid and optic nerve first trimester infection only. Consistent vertical transmission in this primate model may provide a platform to assess risk factors and test therapeutic interventions for interruption of fetal infection. The results may also suggest that maternal-fetal ZIKV transmission in human pregnancy may be more frequent than currently appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Very little is understood about the spawning habitat of endangered delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus which hinders ongoing recovery efforts such as wetland habitat restoration and spawning habitat augmentation. To address this the spawning response of wild-caught H. transpacificus to different substrates and water velocities was examined across three experiments. In experiment 1 spawning response to dead wood pebble natural and artificial Schoenoplectus acutus empty tray and tank floor at water velocities of 1.4 and 8.8 cms was tested. Egg deposition on pebble at 8.8 cms velocity 78.1 of 7778 total eggs was significantly greater than that on all other substrate-velocity combinations. In experiment 2 spawning response to natural S. acutus dead wood sand pebble cobble and empty tray at velocities of 8.7 and 15.4 cms was tested. Egg deposition on pebble at 15.4 cms 61.5 of 36171 total eggs was significantly greater than that on all substrate-velocity combinations except for sand at 15.4 cms. Sand at 15.4 cms 22.3 contained significantly more eggs than all combinations except for pebble at 8.7 and 15.6 cms. In experiment 3 egg attachment to natural S. acutus dead wood sand pebble cobble and empty tray when exposed to 14.6 cms velocity was tested. Egg loss on sand was significantly greater than that on empty tray and pebble indicating that egg deposition on sand may have been underestimated in experiment 2. Together these results indicate that H. transpacificus selects pebble and sand at higher water velocities for spawning under certain laboratory conditions. These findings are important as they provide insight into the potential natural habitats that may be used for spawning and thereby inform ongoing habitat restoration efforts.",

The goal of CWSI formulation is to normalize measured leaf temperatures based on reference temperatures to remove sensitivity to ambient environmental conditions e.g. air temperature humidity radiation while retaining sensitivity to plant water status as reflected by stomatal conductance. This study sought to better understand the sensitivity of these temperatures to ambient environmental conditions and ultimately how they influence various CWSIs. The surface energy balance was modeled to simulate the impacts of input parameter variation on leaf temperature and reference surface temperatures used to calculate four different CWSIs. The performance of the CWSIs were assessed based on their ability to maximize sensitivity to stomatal conductance while minimizing the relative sensitivity to ambient environmental conditions. The sensitivity analyses indicated that all four CWSIs performed poorly in shaded conditions as they had relatively low sensitivity to stomatal conductance and were sensitive to all environmental parameters. Two CWSIs had high sensitivity to stomatal conductance and low sensitivity to all environmental parameters except wind speed. None of CWSIs could remove sensitivity to all environmental parameters while retaining sensitivity to stomatal conductance.",

Unfortunately TAM as originally defined has subsequently frequently been used in the literature as an absolute description of that component of accumulated metal that is trophically available in all prey to all consumers. It is now clear that what is trophically available varies between food items consumers and metals.

    "abstract": "Treatment of the tricyclic amino alcohol methanesulfonate 1 with lithium chloride in dimethylformamide gives only the tricyclic chloro amine 2 while similar treatment of 1 with sodium thiophenoxide in DMF produces solely the rearranged skeleton 3. Analogous skeletal rearrangement is seen in the reaction of alcohol 4 with phosphorus oxychloride and in the pyrolysis of the thiocarbonylimidazolide 6. It is proposed that all of these reactions proceed through a tetracyclic azetidinium ion B and that thioether 3 chloride 5 and compound 7 are products of kinetic control while chloride 2 is the product of thermodynamic control Schemes I and II. It is unusual that chloro amine 5 which is forced to undergo SN2 reaction with net inversion of configuration at nitrogen is substantially more reactive than its isomer 2 in which the substitution occurs with retention of configuration at the nucleophilic center. Several theoretical calculations have been carried out in order to assess the importance of possible stereoelectronic and steric effects. The marked preference of azetidinium ion B to react at C-4 rather than at C-2 can be nicely explained by steric effects there is no indication of stereoelectronic control in the reactions of B. 1985 American Chemical Society.

    "abstract": "Trajectory generation for manipulators involves generating incremental updates of joint variables to achieve a desired endeffector motion. The Jacobian matrix maps incremental joint motion to incremental endeffector motion in a linear fashion and is typically used in manipulator trajectory generation algorithms. In the case of a redundant manipulator the Jacobian matrix is not square or invertible and therefore algorithms based on pseudoinverses and their variations are commonly used for trajectory generation. These methods either are computationally not efficient or do not utilize all the joints in motion generation and therefore do not completely exploit the redundancy of the manipulator. The method presented in this paper is a simple method that maximizes transmission of all joint variables onto a desired endeffector motion trajectory. The method is based on aligning the nullspace of an augmented Jacobian matrix with the path of the desired endeffector motion from which a linear combination of joints that projects fully onto the desired endeffector trajectory is obtained. In this manner all joints of the redundant manipulator are used to generate the endeffector trajectory accommodating the ability of each joint in terms of its motion transmission.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To verify the geometric accuracy of gated RapidArc treatment using kV images acquired during dose delivery. METHODS AND MATERIALS Twenty patients were treated using the gated RapidArc technique with a Varian TrueBeam STx linear accelerator. One to 7 metallic fiducial markers were implanted inside or near the tumor target before treatment simulation. For patient setup and treatment verification purposes the internal target volume ITV was created corresponding to each implanted marker. The gating signal was generated from the Real-time Position Management RPM system. At the beginning of each fraction individualized respiratory gating amplitude thresholds were set based on fluoroscopic image guidance. During the treatment we acquired kV images immediately before MV beam-on at every breathing cycle using the on-board imaging system. After the treatment all implanted markers were detected and their 3-dimensional 3D positions in the patient were estimated using software developed in-house. The distance from the marker to the corresponding ITV was calculated for each patient by averaging over all markers and all fractions. RESULTS The average 3D distance between the markers and their ITVs was 0.8 0.5 mm range 0-1.7 mm and was 2.1 1.2 mm at the 95th percentile range 0-3.8 mm. On average a left-right margin of 0.6 mm an anterior-posterior margin of 0.8 mm and a superior-inferior margin of 1.5 mm is required to account for 95 of the intrafraction uncertainty in RPM-based RapidArc gating. CONCLUSION To our knowledge this is the first clinical report of intrafraction verification of respiration-gated RapidArc treatment in stereotactic ablative radiation therapy. For some patients the markers deviated significantly from the ITV by more than 2 mm at the beginning of the MV beam-on. This emphasizes the need for gating techniques with beam-on-off controlled directly by the actual position of the tumor target instead of external surrogates such as RPM.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Race-based survival in children and adolescents with hematologic malignancies has been a national challenge for decades. Large-scale investigations of age- and race-based survival trends over time in these patients have not previously been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate whether race- and age-related differences in pediatric and adolescent and young adult AYA leukemia and lymphoma survival persist and to what extent these differences have changed over time. METHODS Using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program this study investigated the outcomes of black and white 1975-2012 n 27369 and white and Hispanic 1992-2012 n 20574 children 0-14 years old and AYAs 15-39 years old with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL acute myelogenous leukemia AML and Hodgkin lymphoma HL. Estimates of 5- and 10-year relative survival were compared over time. RESULTS Trends showed a convergence of survival for white and black children with ALL but a divergence in survival for AYA patients. Hispanic children and AYAs both suffered inferior outcomes. Trends for AML revealed persistent survival differences between black and white children and suggested worsening disparities for AYAs. Survival trends in HL revealed sustained survival differences between black and white AYA patients whereas no differences were found in Hispanic and white patient outcomes for AML or HL. CONCLUSIONS Although survival for children and AYAs with ALL AML and HL has improved over the past 4 decades differences persist between black white and Hispanic children and AYAs survival disparities between black and white children with ALL have been nearly eliminated. Strategies aimed at identifying causality and reducing disparities are warranted. Cancer 2016. 2016 American Cancer Society. Cancer 20161222723-2730. 2016 American Cancer Society.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Knowledge regarding late effects medical conditions and subsequent neoplasms in survivors of adolescent and young adult AYA acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is lacking. METHODS Using the population-based California Cancer Registry linked with California hospitalization data we evaluated late effects in 1069 AYAs aged 15-39 years diagnosed with ALL in California between 1995 and 2012 and surviving a minimum of 3 years from diagnosis. RESULTS The estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of subsequent endocrine disease 28.7 95 confidence interval CI 25.8 to 31.6 and cardiac disease 17.0 95 CI 14.6 to 19.5 were strikingly high avascular necrosis 9.6 95 CI 7.8 to 11.6 liver disease 6.5 95 CI 5.0 to 8.3 respiratory disease 6.2 95 CI 4.8 to 8.0 seizure andor stroke 4.3 95 CI 3.1 to 5.8 renal disease 3.1 95 CI 2.1 to 4.4 and second neoplasms 1.4 95 CI 0.7 to 2.4 were estimated to occur at 10 years with the reported frequencies. Multivariable analyses including the entire patient cohort demonstrated that public or no insurance vs private andor military insurance and receipt of hematopoietic cell transplantation were independently associated with the occurrence of all late effects considered. In multivariable analyses limited to the 766 AYAs who were not transplanted we continued to find a statistically significant association between public and no insurance and the occurrence of all late effects. Frontline regimen type pediatric vs adult was not statistically significantly associated with any of the late effect categories. CONCLUSIONS This large population-based analysis is among the first to describe late effects in survivors of AYA ALL. The strong association between insurance type and late effects suggests that AYAs with public or no insurance may have reduced access to survivorship care following completion of ALL therapy.",

We then prove that the model has a spectral gap above the ground states for a range of coupling constants that includes physical values. As a consequence of the gap we establish the incompressibility of the fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that all the ground states labeled by a tiling have a finite correlation length for which we give an upper bound.

    "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the safety of irreversible electroporation IRE for renal ablation adjacent to the ureter or bowel. Materials and Methods Six adult pigs each underwent bilateral IRE of the kidney. To simulate adjacence the left proximal ureter and duodenum were secured onto the left and right kidney capsule respectively. Two IRE probes were placed into the renal parenchyma and configured to bridge the ureter and bowel. Therapeutic IRE was delivered at 2000 Vcm for 70 pulses in both forward and reverse polarity. The animal was survived and euthanized at 1 3 or 14 days. Histopathology was obtained for all potentially injured bowel and ureteral segments. Retrograde pyelogram RPG was performed on each left-sided ureter. Results Histologic analysis of the ureter identified reactive changes at the level of the periureteral adipose tissue which progressed from acute inflammation on day 1 to focal fibrosis by day 14. Urothelial mucosa and surrounding smooth muscle layers were unaffected at all time points. RPGs did not show any abnormalities in all specimens. Histologic analysis of the bowel demonstrated acute inflammation in the serosa and subserosal tissue on day 1. Three days after IRE inflammation and crypt abscesses were focally present in the deep aspects of the bowel mucosa. Inflammation in the mucosal layer resolved 14 days after IRE. Conclusions In a porcine model of renal IRE no significant injury was apparent after intentional ablation adjacent to the ureter and bowel. IRE may be a safe alternative to thermal ablation for tumors near the ureter or bowel.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality among older women with hip osteoarthritis OA and to identify mediators in the causal pathway. METHODS Data were from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures a US population-based cohort study of 9704 white women age 65 years. The analytic sample included women with hip radiographs at baseline n 7889 and year 8 n 5749. Mortality was confirmed through October 2013 by death certificates and hospital discharge summaries. Radiographic hip OA RHOA was defined as a Croft grade of 2 in at least 1 hip definite joint space narrowing or osteophytes plus 1 other radiographic feature. RESULTS The mean SD followup time was 16.1 6.2 years. The baseline and year 8 prevalence of RHOA were 8.0 and 11.0 respectively. The cumulative incidence proportion of deaths during the study period was 67.7 for all-cause mortality 26.3 for cardiovascular disease CVD mortality 11.7 for cancer mortality 1.9 for gastrointestinal disease mortality and 27.8 for all other mortality causes. RHOA was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality hazard ratio 1.14 95 confidence interval 1.05-1.24 and CVD mortality hazard ratio 1.24 95 confidence interval 1.09-1.41 adjusted for age body mass index education smoking health status diabetes and stroke. These associations were partially explained by the mediating variable of physical function. CONCLUSION RHOA was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality among older white women followed up for 16 years. Dissemination of evidence-based physical activity and self-management interventions for hip OA in community and clinical settings can improve physical function and might also contribute to lower mortality.",

    "abstract": "Several phylogenetic lineages of the infectious bursal disease virus IBDV genome segment B have been identified. Although this genome segment has been shown to contribute to virulence little is known about the genetic lineages that exist in the United States. The nucleotide genome segment B sequences of 67 IBDV strains collected from 2002 to 2011 in the United States were examined. Although they were from nine different states a majority 47 of these viruses were from California. A 722-base pair region near the 5 end of genome segment B starting at nucleotide 168 and ending at 889 was examined and compared to sequences available in GenBank. The nucleotide sequence alignment revealed that mutations were frequently observed and that they were uniformly spaced throughout the region. When the predicted amino acids were aligned amino acids at positions 145 146 and 147 were found to change frequently. Six different amino acid triplets were observed and the very virulent vv IBDV strains based on presence of vvIBDV genome segment A sequence all had the triplet T145 D146 and N147. None of the non-vvIBDV strains had this TDN triplet. Phylogenetic analysis of the 67 nucleotide sequences revealed four significant genome segment B lineages among the U.S. viruses. One of these included the genome segment B typically found in vvIBDV and three contained non-vvIBDV genome segment B sequences. When the available sequences in GenBank were added to the analysis two additional lineages were observed that did not contain U.S. viruses one included viruses from China and the other contained viruses from the Ivory Coast. Although the samples tested do not represent all poultry producing regions in the United States serotype 1 viruses from states outside California all belonged to one genome segment B lineage. The other three lineages observed in the United States were populated with viruses exclusively found in California except the serotype 2 lineage where the type strain was a serotype 2 virus from Ohio. The data provide further evidence for the importance of genome segment B identification during routine molecular diagnosis of all IBDV strains.",

While premenopausal breast cancer is inherently more aggressive no studies to date have evaluated the characteristics and breast cancer-specific survival BCSS of premenopausal secondary breast cancer after radiotherapy in AYA and childhood cancer survivors. METHODS Female patients ages 12 to 50 diagnosed with primary breast cancer from 1988 to 2014 n 107751 were obtained from the California Cancer Registry and compared with similar aged patients with secondary breast cancer who were treated with radiotherapy for their primary tumor n 1147 from ages 12 to 39. We examined BCSS using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS The secondary breast cancer cohort was more likely to be Hispanic or Black be 35 to 45 years of age have earlier stage tumors be higher grade have no lymph node involvement and be hormone receptor negative. All women showed worse BCSS for large tumor size lymph node involvement and hormone receptor-negative status. BCSS was worse for women with secondary breast cancer both overall hazard ratio 1.98 95 confidence interval 1.77-2.23 and in all subgroups considered. Associations were most pronounced in Hispanics AsianPacific Islanders and younger women as well as those with earlier stage lymph node-negative and hormone receptor-positive disease. CONCLUSIONS BCSS is significantly decreased among all survivors of childhood and AYA cancer treated with radiotherapy that develop a secondary breast cancer including women with good prognostic features. IMPACT Therefore we may need to consider alternative and even more aggressive treatment in what were considered low-risk populations previously.",

This system was successfully used to introduce the sense and antisense cDNA that encode an ACC oxidase ACO cloned from the ripe pear fruit into the pear genome. The transcriptional activity of the transgene and endogenous gene in the transgenic shoots were detected by the strand-specific probes used in RNA blot analysis. The gene co-suppression was found in almost all antisense lines and one sense line while the over-expression was observed in other sense lines. The ethylene production in transgenic shoots was consistent with the expression of sense-strand ACO transcription when the samples were incubated in 1 mM ACC which is a unique substrate of ACO. Ethylene production in in vitro shoots was reduced by 85 in an antisense line. In vitro flowering and abnormal rooting was found in some antisense shoots.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although frailty has been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty THA and total knee arthroplasty TKA prior studies have not examined how raceethnicity might moderate these associations. We aimed to assess raceethnicity as a potential moderator of the associations of frailty and functional status with arthroplasty outcomes. METHODS The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried for patients who underwent THA or TKA from 2011 to 2017. Frailty was assessed using the modified frailty index. Regression analyses were conducted to examine associations connecting frailtyfunctional status with 30-day readmission adverse discharge and length of stay LOS. Further analyses were conducted to investigate raceethnicity as a potential moderator of these relationships. RESULTS We identified 219143 TKA and 130022 THA patients. Frailty and nonindependent functional status were positively associated with all outcomes P .001. Compared to White non-Hispanic patients Black non-Hispanic patients had higher odds for all outcomes after TKA P .001 and for adverse dischargelonger LOS after THA P .001. Similar associations were observed for Hispanics for the adverse dischargeLOS outcomes. Raceethnicity moderated the effects of frailty in TKA for all outcomes and in THA for adverse dischargeLOS. Raceethnicity moderated the effects of nonindependent function in TKA for adverse dischargeLOS and on LOS alone for THA. CONCLUSION Disparities for Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients persist for readmission adverse discharge and LOS. However the effects of increasing frailty and nonindependent functional status on these outcomes were the most pronounced among White non-Hispanic patients.",

    "abstract": "Ray-finned fishes make up half of all living vertebrate species. Nearly all ray-finned fishes are teleosts which include most commercially important fish species several model organisms for genomics and developmental biology and the dominant component of marine and freshwater vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance of ray-finned fishes the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny with corresponding divergence-time estimates has limited our understanding of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36 fossil age constraints result in a well-supported phylogeny of all major ray-finned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs three long-standing problems specifically identifying elopomorphs eels and tarpons as the sister lineage of all other teleosts providing a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts and offering a promising strategy for resolution of the bush at the top of the tree that includes percomorphs and other spiny-finned teleosts. Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes we find that the former underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences but the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages. Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic identifying this period as the Second Age of Fishes.",

RESULTS Animals with intraocular 4 dogs and 1 cat or conjunctival 3 dogs and 1 cat lymphoma represented 0.1 and 0.08 of patients with lymphoma evaluated at the hospital during the study period respectively. Animals with intraocular lymphoma represented 0.19 of all patients with uveitis animals with conjunctival lymphoma represented 0.16 of all patients with conjunctivitis. Tumors included B-cell 2 intraocular and 1 conjunctival non-B-cell non-T-cell 1 intraocular and T-cell 3 conjunctival neoplasms immunophenotype of 2 uveal lymphomas was not determined. Treatments included enucleation 4 intraocular and chemotherapy 3 intraocular and 2 conjunctival. All dogs with intraocular lymphoma developed neurologic signs. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 2 patients with conjunctival lymphoma. Median PFST and OST were 178 days for all animals with PSOL dogs with PSOL and animals with intraocular lymphoma. Median PFST and OST for animals with conjunctival lymphoma were 221 and 549 days respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated PSOL was uncommon but should be considered a differential diagnosis for animals with uveitis or conjunctivitis. Performance of MRI and cytologic analysis of CSF and regional lymph node aspirate samples may be beneficial for such patients. Prognosis seemed to be better for animals with conjunctival lymphoma than it was for those with intraocular lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Digital pathology is becoming an increasingly popular area of advancement in both research and clinically. Pathologists are now able to manage and interpret slides digitally as well as collaborate with external pathologists with digital copies of slides. Differences in slide scanners include variation in resolution image contrast and optical properties which may influence downstream image processing. This study tested the hypothesis that varying slide scanners would result in differences in computed pathomic features on prostate cancer whole mount slides. DESIGN This study collected 192 unique tissue slides from 30 patients following prostatectomy. Tissue samples were paraffin-embedded stained for hematoxylin and eosin HE and digitized using 3 different scanning microscopes at the highest available magnification rate for a total of 3 digitized slides per tissue slide. These scanners included a S1 Nikon microscope equipped with an automated sliding stage an S2 Olympus VS120 slide scanner and a S3 Huron TissueScope LE scanner. A color deconvolution algorithm was then used to optimize contrast by projecting the RGB image into color channels representing optical stain density. The resulting intensity standardized images were then computationally processed to segment tissue and calculate pathomic features including lumen stroma epithelium and epithelial cell density as well as second-order features including lumen area and roundness epithelial area roundness and wall thickness and cell fraction. For each tested feature mean values of that feature per digitized slide were collected and compared across slide scanners using mixed effect models fit to compare differences in the tested feature associated with all slide scanners for each slide including a random effect of subject with a nested random effect of slide to account for repeated measures. Similar models were also computed for tissue densities to examine how differences in scanner impact downstream processing. RESULTS Each mean color channel intensity i.e. Red Green Blue differed between slide scanners all P.001. Of the color deconvolved images only the hematoxylin channel was similar in all 3 scanners all P.05. Lumen and stroma densities between S3 and S1 slides and epithelial cell density between S3 and S2 P.05 were comparable but all other comparisons were significantly different P.05. The second-order features were found to be comparable for all scanner comparisons except for lumen area and epithelium area. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that both optical and computed properties of digitized histological samples are impacted by slide scanner differences. Future research is warranted to better understand which scanner properties influence the tissue segmentation process and to develop harmonization techniques for comparing data across multiple slide scanners.",

    "abstract": "This article examines how different groups of Luo people living in a village in western Kenya fought over publicized and sought to harness the power of a returned python-spirit referred to as Omieri. The alleged return of Omieri catalyzed the local imagination concerning a range of issues and mobilized all of the major social groups and dominant cosmological-ideological perspectives in the region while also becoming a source of cooperation and local autonomy against the control of the national state and regional elites. In addition to generating conflict Omieri became a possible means of manufacturing an improved Luo future through appropriate historical remembrance and sacrifice and reflected the sense of unprecedented but ambiguous potential that permeated Luoland in the months following the epochal presidential elections of December 2002. The case demonstrates how local social preoccupations-including those related to ecological deterioration religious transformation gendered and generational conflict and privatization-are shaped by far-reaching structural transformations but experienced through local cultural traditions and understandings. 2006 Sage Publications.

We operationalize the multivariate system as a network and define coherence as the efficiency with which a signal is transmitted throughout the network. We illustrate this approach with time series data from 15 psychophysiological signals representing individuals moment-by-moment emotional reactions to emotional films. First we summarize the time series through nonparametric Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curves. Second we use Spearman rank correlations to calculate relationships between each pair of variables. Third based on the obtained associations we construct a network using the variables as nodes. Finally we examine signal transmission through all the nodes in the network. Our results indicate that the network consisting of the 15 psychophysiological signals has a small-world structure with three clusters of variables and strong within-cluster connections. This structure supports an effective signal transmission across the entire network. When compared across experimental conditions our results indicate that coherence is relatively stronger for intense emotional stimuli than for neutral stimuli. These findings are discussed in relation to multivariate methods and emotion theories. 2010 The Psychometric Society.",

PARTICIPANTS A random sample of 1566 Medicare enrollees age 65 and older enrolled in the CHS. MEASUREMENTS Total hip BMD measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry DEXA after adjustment for multiple covariates was compared with depression evaluated with the Center for Epidemiological Studies 10-item Depression Scale CES-Dm. Risk factors for osteoporosis were compared in depressed and nondepressed participants. Potential correlates were entered into a regression model. Depression scores were compared in normal osteopenic and osteoporotic individuals. RESULTS Sixteen percent of participants were clinically depressed 9 had BMDs in the osteoporotic range. Mean BMD was 40 mgcm2 lower in those with clinical depression. High CES-Dm scores were associated with lower BMD P .001 when adjusted for body mass index BMI age kilocalories of activity estrogen use gender race smoking and drinking. When stratified by race this remained true for all Caucasians P .01 all African Americans P .05 and when stratified by race and gender the association remained only for all Caucasian women P .001. In women and Caucasian men there was an increase in depression scores among individuals with osteoporotic-range BMDs. CONCLUSIONS A significant association was found between BMD and depressive symptoms after adjustment for osteoporosis risk factors. In Caucasians depressive symptoms were associated with both osteoporotic and osteopenic levels of BMD. Causality cannot be ascribed with only one measurement of BMD. We postulate that there may be an unmeasured third factor such as an endogenous steroid that is responsible for both low BMD and depression.",

    "abstract": "Ride-hailing services which are offered by companies such as Uber and Lyft have the potential to produce both benefits and negative externalities. In particular ride-hailing can help improve mobility and accessibility but can also contribute to increases in vehicle-miles traveled congestion and emissions. Induced ride-hailing trips i.e. trips that would not have been made if ride-hailing was not available represent somewhat of a middle ground between benefits and negative externalities. Studies on ride-hailing use have consistently found evidence of induced trips however relatively little is known about induced ride-hailing trips. This study uses data from a weeklong smartphone-based travel survey conducted in three metropolitan regions in California to examine the attributes of induced ride-hailing trips and the people who made said trips during the survey period. Descriptive analysis hypothesis testing and binary logistic regression are applied to gain insights into the attributes of induced ride-hailing trips and the factors influencing whether a person recorded an induced trip during the survey period. The results suggest that induced trips are more likely to correspond to discretionary and maintenance activities and more likely to be made using pooled ride-hailing services. Additionally the members of groups that have traditionally experienced transportation disadvantage including people with disabilities people from lower-income households and people from zero-vehicle households were more likely to record an induced trip. This information can help inform efforts to improve the mobility and accessibility of disadvantaged groups and contribute to improvements in transit and paratransit services.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare three models of pediatric physiatry care in-person hybrid and all-virtual in terms of parent experience and physician- and therapist-reported quality of care. We hypothesized that the all-virtual model would have lower parent experience scores and lower quality scores compared with the other two models of care. METHODS We designed a convergent parallel mixed methods study incorporating a cluster-randomized crossover design. Quantitative data included surveys of parents physicians and therapists after visits to 13 medical therapy units in Northern California between January 2020 and January 2022. Qualitative data were collected in six focus groups with parents physicians and therapists. RESULTS A total of 2455 visits were completed for 1281 unique children during the study period including 507 in-person visits 246 hybrid visits and 1702 all-virtual visits. There were no differences in parent experience scores between the three models of care. Physicians and therapists rated all-virtual visits significantly lower in terms of quality of care parent education and physical exam compared with the other two models of care but qualitative results highlighted specific instances where all-virtual visits could be useful. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that parents therapists and physicians find a hybrid virtual model is an acceptable model of care that maintains the quality of care and facilitates parent education. All-virtual models may be appropriate for specific circumstances but are perceived as lower quality. Research exploring implementation of these models would be valuable for providing practical guidance in the future.",

A wound retraction device was inserted in each incision. Ability to exteriorize various abdominal organs to the extent required to reasonably perform a surgical biopsy was recorded and results were compared among incision sites. On the basis of results obtained the access incision that provided exposure of the most frequently biopsied abdominal organs was used to perform MIOB in 6 feline clinical patients with various underlying pathological conditions. RESULTS On the basis of experiments with research cats a 3-cm access incision centered midway between the caudal margin of the xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus was found to provide access for MIOB for most organs. In 5 of 6 clinical patients all of the organs of interest were biopsied successfully via this incision location although access to all hepatic lobes and all parts of the pancreas was inconsistent. In 1 cat conversion to an open approach was performed because a palpable mass was detected in the area of the duodenocolic ligament.

Most dogs present with signs from tumor rupture resulting in hemoabdomen and intra-abdominal dissemination. The abdomen is also the main site of disease recurrence. HYPOTHESIS Intraperitoneal IP administration of doxorubicin will delay or prevent intra-abdominal tumor recurrence and prolong survival in dogs with HSA. ANIMALS Fourteen dogs with splenic HSA. METHODS A prospective unmasked uncontrolled clinical trial. After staging of disease status and splenectomy pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin was administered intraperitoneally 1 mgkg body weight every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. All dogs were monitored for recurrence of HSA. Samples of plasma and abdominal fluid were collected for measurement of doxorubicin concentration and pharmacokinetic analysis. Nonlinear mixed-effect modeling was used to describe the pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin administered IP. RESULTS All 14 dogs died 12 because of HSA and 2 from other causes. Postmortem examination was performed on 12 dogs. All 12 dogs died because of HSA-related causes and had hepatic metastases and hemoabdomen. The IP-treated dogs had fewer serosal mesenteric and omental metastases than historical controls treated with systemic doxorubicin. Results of the postmortem examination and pharmacokinetic analysis confirmed that IP delivery of doxorubicin resulted in an effective drug concentration with a clearance comparable with that after i.v. delivery. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE IP pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin administration did not prevent intraabdominal recurrence of HSA in dogs.",

    "abstract": "Interactions of drug molecules with lipid membranes play crucial role in their accessibility of cellular targets and can be an important predictor of their therapeutic and safety profiles. Very little is known about spatial localization of various drugs in the lipid bilayers their active form ionization state or translocation rates and therefore potency to bind to different sites in membrane proteins. All-atom molecular simulations may help to map drug partitioning kinetics and thermodynamics thus providing in-depth assessment of drug lipophilicity. As a proof of principle we evaluated extensively lipid membrane partitioning of d-sotalol well-known blocker of a cardiac potassium channel Kv11.1 encoded by the hERG gene with reported substantial proclivity for arrhythmogenesis. We developed the positively charged cationic and neutral d-sotalol models compatible with the biomolecular CHARMM force field and subjected them to all-atom molecular dynamics MD simulations of drug partitioning through hydrated lipid membranes aiming to elucidate thermodynamics and kinetics of their translocation and thus putative propensities for hydrophobic and aqueous hERG access. We found that only a neutral form of d-sotalol accumulates in the membrane interior and can move across the bilayer within millisecond time scale and can be relevant to a lipophilic channel access. The computed water-membrane partitioning coefficient for this form is in good agreement with experiment. There is a large energetic barrier for a cationic form of the drug dominant in water to cross the membrane resulting in slow membrane translocation kinetics. However this form of the drug can be important for an aqueous access pathway through the intracellular gate of hERG. This route will likely occur after a neutral form of a drug crosses the membrane and subsequently re-protonates. Our study serves to demonstrate a first step toward a framework for multi-scale in silico safety pharmacology and identifies some of the challenges that lie therein.",

Therefore mouse xenograft models are commonly used to study human leukemia biology and to develop new therapeutics. Leukemia can be maintained and expanded through serial transplantations. Although many mouse models with different types of leukemia mouse strains and inoculation methods have been used there are very few studies validating the models.jatsp jatspWe have established acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL mouse models using primary ALL samples and NODSCIDIL2Rg null NSG mice. In order to increase engraftment efficiency we transplanted leukemia cells into healthy adult mice via intra-bone marrow BM injection 1 to 100 million cells per mouse to tibia bilaterally. To our knowledge the model with primary ALL samples in NSG mice via intra-BM injection is novel. A total of 9 samples 2 T cell ALL and 7 precursor B preB ALL were transplanted into cohorts of 3 to 8 mice each. Of these 1 T cell ALL and 6 preB ALL samples engrafted and 1 T cell and 1 preB ALL sample failed to engraft. Leukemia engraftment was observed between 10 to 33 weeks after transplantation. In each cohort each mouse developed leukemia at approximately the same time after leukemia transplantation. Necropsy showed significant hepatosplenomegaly and white BM in all mice indicating leukemia infiltration. Cells were harvested from BM spleen and other leukemia-infiltrated organs and confirmed to be human origin by flow cytometry using anti-HLA-ABC and anti- human CD45 antibodies. Nearly 100 of BM was replaced with human leukemia cells.jatsp jatspOne T cell and 1 preB ALL sample have been serially transplanted using the same method as the primary transplantation to quaternary and tertiary generations respectively. We observed that the time to develop leukemia became shorter with each transplantation 16 weeks for the first transplantation and 10 weeks for the tertiary transplantation in a T cell ALL sample. Some mice transplanted with a preB ALL sample developed chloroma. Interestingly chloroma development was consistently observed with this sample which was transferred through serial transplantation although the patient did not develop chloroma. Morphology and immunophenotype were similar to the original leukemia. There were some changes in CD expression patterns however immunophenotyping was consistent with the original leukemia.jatsp jatspTo help understand phenotype progression in transplanted leukemia samples we are currently comparing the transcriptome profiles of leukemia samples obtained from the patient primary and quaternary mice for T cell ALL and primary and tertiary mice for preB ALL samples preB ALL patient sample not available. Next-generation sequencing NGS-based RNA-Sequencing RNA-Seq is in progress for this analysis. In addition to obtaining digital expression profiles and differential gene expression RNA-Seq analysis will reveal the complete repertoire of splice variants point mutations and fusion transcripts in the ALL samples. Complete results of these analyses for our mouse models with both T cell and preB ALL will be presented. Thus this technique will provide the most detailed transcriptomic analysis and no validation studies have yet been reported on ALL samples sequentially engrafted NSG mice using RNA-Seq.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Aural plaques affect at least 22 of horses and can be asymptomatic or cause ear sensitivity. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy studies have shown a strong association between aural plaques and papilloma virus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of imiquimod 5 cream an immune response modifier with potent antiviral activity in the treatment of equine aural plaques. Twenty-one horses were enrolled and 16 completed the study. Imiquimod 5 cream was applied three times a week every other week. When both ears were affected only the worst affected ear was treated. Adverse effects in all horses included marked local inflammation exudation and thick crust formation at the site of treatment and the adjacent skin. Removal of the crust before treatment was painful and required sedation in most horses. Complete resolution of lesions was noted in all horses immediately post-treatment and the long-term resolution rate was 87.5. Duration of therapy ranged from 1.5 to 8 months median 2.9 mean 3.5. All horses were followed-up for 12-22 months after treatment was discontinued and only two horses had a recurrence of lesions. Clinical signs related to the aural plaques prior to treatment were reported in 11 of 16 68.8 horses and included resistance to touching the ears and bridling. Complete resolution of these signs was reported by the owners in all of the horses followed-up for at least 12 months. In conclusion the topical application of imiquimod 5 cream is an efficacious treatment for aural plaques in horses.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Human milk oligosaccharides HMOS are indigestible carbohydrates that support infant development by establishing a healthy microbiota preventing infectious diseases and promoting immune and cognitive development. Individual HMOS have distinct functions based on their chemical structures. HMO profiles can vary largely among mothers but the research on factors other than genetic background affecting HMO composition are limited. METHODS In the present analysis we examined the relationships between maternal characteristics and the HMO profiles of breastfeeding mothers n 392 in the STRONG kids 2 with the following demographic characteristics average age 30.8 y 74.5 White and 75.5 exclusively breastfeeding. Human milk samples were collected at 6 weeks postpartum and maternal information was obtained from self-reported surveys. Information on dietary intake changes since the participants have been breastfeeding was collected. HMO profiles were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and secretor status was determined by the presence of four secretor markers 2-fucosyllactose 2-FL LNFP I LDFT and TFLNH. Spearmen correlation test was utilized to determine the relationships between individual HMOS and associations with maternal factors. Between-group differences in HMO relative abundances were examined with Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS Among all participants 71.9 were secretors and 28.1 were non-secretors. The relative abundances of all HMOS differed p 0.05 by secretor status with the exception for 6-SL and 3-SL. Positive correlations were observed among HMOS with similar structures such as the 12-fucosylated HMOS. The abundances of selected HMOS were associated with maternal body weight pregnancy complications and dietary characteristics. Based on pre-pregnancy BMI in all mothers relative abundance of 3-SL was significantly higher in overweight mothers than obese mothers p 0.013. In milk produced by non-secretor mothers LNPF I III abundances were greater in overweight than normal weight mothers p 0.020. Several HMO abundances were found to be associated with Gestational diabetes mellitus GDM. Variations of HMO abundances were also observed with dietary food intake. In all mothers egg consumption was positively correlated with LNT LNnT R 0.13 p 0.012 and cheese intake was positively associated with 2-FL R 0.10 p 0.046 and S-LNnH II R 0.11 p 0.026 abundances. DISCUSSION HMO profiles were found to be associated with maternal characteristics and intake. Future research will investigate associations between HMOS and maternal and infant outcomes.",

These components have been individually linked to increased risks of cognitive decline and Alzheimers disease. We aimed to comprehensively relate all of the components of metabolic dysregulation to cognitive function and brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI in middle-aged adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Framingham Offspring participants who underwent volumetric MRI and detailed cognitive testing and were free of clinical stroke and dementia during examination 7 1998-2001 constituted our study sample n 2439 1311 women age 61 9 years. We related diabetes homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance HOMA-IR fasting insulin and glycohemoglobin levels to cross-sectional MRI measures of total cerebral brain volume TCBV and hippocampal volume and to verbal and visuospatial memory and executive function. We serially adjusted for age sex and education alone model A additionally for other vascular risk factors model B and finally with the inclusion of apolipoprotein E-4 plasma homocysteine C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 model C. RESULTS We observed an inverse association between all indices of metabolic dysfunction and TCBV in all models P 0.030. The observed difference in TCBV between participants with and without diabetes was equivalent to approximately 6 years of chronologic aging. Diabetes and elevated glycohemoglobin HOMA-IR and fasting insulin were related to poorer executive function scores P 0.038 whereas only HOMA-IR and fasting insulin were inversely related to visuospatial memory P 0.007. CONCLUSIONS Metabolic dysregulation especially insulin resistance was associated with lower brain volumes and executive function in a large relatively healthy middle-aged community-based cohort.",

As a result it is often assumed that these animals make relatively minor contributions to ecosystem processes. Despite their small sizes and cumulative biomass we suggest that these animals may commonly have important effects on carbon and nutrient cycling by modulating the quality and quantity of resources that enter the detrital food web with consequences at the ecosystem level. These effects can occur through multiple pathways including direct inputs of insect biomass the transformation of detrital biomass and the indirect effects of predators on herbivores and detritivores. In virtually all cases the ecosystem effects of these pathways are ultimately mediated through interactions with plants and soil microbes. Merging our understanding of insect plant and microbial ecology will offer a valuable way to better integrate community-level interactions with ecosystem processes.",

To study such cross interactions methods that can generalize over proteins that vary greatly in sequence structure and function are needed. We present a general quantitative approach to protein-ligand binding affinity prediction that spans the entire structural enzyme-ligand space. The model was trained on a data set composed of all available enzymes cocrystallized with druglike ligands taken from four publicly available interaction databases for which a crystal structure is available. Each enzyme was characterized by a set of local descriptors of protein structure that describe the binding site of the cocrystallized ligand. The ligands in the training set were described by traditional QSAR descriptors. To evaluate the model a comprehensive test set consisting of enzyme structures and ligands was manually curated. The test set contained enzyme-ligand complexes for which no crystal structures were available and thus the binding modes were unknown. The test set enzymes were therefore characterized by matching their entire structures to the local descriptor library constructed from the training set. Both the training and the test set contained enzyme-ligand complexes from all major enzyme classes and the enzymes spanned a large range of sequences and folds. The experimental binding affinities p K i ranged from 0.5 to 11.9 0.7-11.0 in the test set. The induced model predicted the binding affinities of the external test set enzyme-ligand complexes with an r 2 of 0.53 and an RMSEP of 1.5. This demonstrates that the use of local descriptors makes it possible to create rough predictive models that can generalize over a wide range of protein targets.",

Diagnosis of these fractures can be challenging and little is known about their configuration or outcome. The objectives of this retrospective case series study were to describe the clinical features imaging findings and outcomes of fractures of the central tarsal bone in a sample of nonracehorses. Medical records from 2001 to 2014 were searched for cases of central tarsal bone fractures in nonracehorses. All available imaging findings including radiography ultrasound computed tomography CT andor nuclear scintigraphy were reviewed. History clinical presentation and outcome were collected from the records. Four horses met the inclusion criteria. All had a similar configuration as a simple nondisplaced slab fracture in a dorsomedial to plantarolateral orientation. Initial radiographs failed to reveal the fracture in three of four cases. When additional plantarolateral-dorsomedial oblique radiographic views were obtained the fracture could be identified in all cases. Fractures of the central tarsal bone seemed to occur in a consistent dorsomedial to plantarolateral orientation in this sample of nonracehorses which is different from the configuration previously reported in racehorses. While CT can be used for detection and assessment of these fractures authors propose that radiography can also identify these fractures with the appropriate view. Authors recommend the use of several plantarolateral to dorsomedial radiographic projections at varying degrees of obliquity for horses with a suspected central tarsal bone fracture.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Optical coherence tomography angiography OCTA is a new noninvasive imaging modality that provides high resolution images of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retinal capillary vasculature which can be affected by optic nerve or retinal pathologies. High repeatability of peripapillary capillary density measurement using OCTA has been demonstrated in normal eyes and eyes with glaucoma. The purpose of our study was to quantify the repeatability of peripapillary capillary density measurement using OCTA in both normal eyes and eyes with optic atrophy optic disc edema and retinal vasculopathy. METHODS This prospective cross-sectional study enrolled 31 patients 59 eyes including 16 eyes with optic nerve pathology 7 with disc edema from papilledema and 9 with optic atrophy 35 eyes with retinal vascular disease and 8 normal eyes. All eyes were imaged twice 30 minutes apart with the Optovue AngioVue OCTA instrument to obtain 4.5 4.5 mm peripapillary scans. Scans were considered good quality if signal strength was 6 or greater. The OCTA parameters obtained include the radial peripapillary capillary RPC density of the whole disc inside the disc peripapillary region and the 4 quadrants of the disc superior nasal inferior and temporal. A Students t test was used to compare means. Intraclass correlation coefficient ICC was calculated to measure repeatability. RESULTS Repeatability of RPC density measurements for all regions analyzed demonstrated good to excellent repeatability for the whole cohort ICC for the whole image was 0.915 95 confidence interval CI 0.855-0.951 ICC for the peripapillary region was 0.945 95 CI 0.905-0.969. In the subset of eyes with good image quality i.e. signal strength 6 ICC was slightly higher for all regions with excellent repeatability of the peripapillary region ICC was 0.971 95 CI 0.943-0.986. Conversely for eyes with poor image quality scans i.e. signal strength 6 ICC was lower corresponding to moderate to good repeatability for most parameters. For the subset of eyes with optic atrophy disc edema from papilledema or retinal vasculopathy all had good to excellent repeatability of the vessel density of the entire disc ICC values were 0.954 95 CI 0.804-0.990 0.921 95 CI 0.711-0.982 and 0.895 95 CI 0.788-0.951 respectively and of the peripapillary region ICC values were 0.980 95 CI 0.904-0.996 0.966 95 CI 0.854-0.993 and 0.916 95 CI 0.827-0.961 respectively. CONCLUSIONS The peripapillary capillary density measurement obtained using a commercial OCTA instrument is highly repeatable in eyes with optic nerve atrophy disc edema from papilledema or retinal vasculopathy.",

STUDY DESIGN Open-label multicenter study enrolling heterosexually-active women with previous permanent contraception. Participants underwent a baseline postcoital test cycle with no device to confirm the presence of sperm followed by one diaphragm postcoital test cycle one Ovaprene safety cycle and two Ovaprene postcoital test cycles. In each postcoital test cycle participants underwent a midcycle cervical mucus evaluation to confirm an Insler score 10 and absence of sperm and then returned two to four hours after vaginal intercourse for repeat cervical mucus evaluation. We considered 5 progressively motile spermHPF indicative of preliminary contraceptive effectiveness. RESULTS We enrolled 38 participants 23 completed the study. All participants had 5 progressively motile spermHPF in the baseline cycle and 5 progressively motile spermHPF in all 49 Ovaprene cycles and all 35 diaphragm cycles meeting the definition of a successful postcoital test. This was true regardless of examiner blinding prior vaginal delivery or vaginal ring use body mass index or dislodgements noted by the participant or investigator. The mean of 27.2 17.9 progressively motile spermHPF in baseline postcoital test cycles was reduced to 0.5 1.1 and 0.5 1.3 progressively motile spermHPF in the first and second Ovaprene cycles respectively. Ovaprene fit all participants and all could insert position and remove it. CONCLUSION Use of Ovaprene resulted in meeting the prespecified criterion for contraceptive effect by all participants during all postcoital test cycles. IMPLICATIONS The finding that use of Ovaprene an investigational monthly non-hormonal vaginal contraceptive resulted in postcoital testing of cervical mucus that met the pre-specified definition of success 5 progressively motile spermHPF supports further evaluation of contraceptive efficacy of the device in users at risk for pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To identify pathogenic mutations responsible for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in 5 consanguineous Pakistani families. METHODS Affected individuals in the families underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination that consisted of fundus photography and electroretinography. Blood samples were collected from all participating family members and genomic DNA was extracted. A genome-wide linkage scan was performed followed by exclusion analyses among our cohort of nuclear consanguineous families with microsatellite markers spanning the TULP1 locus on chromosome 6p. Two-point logarithm of odds scores were calculated and all coding exons of TULP1 were sequenced bidirectionally. RESULTS The results of ophthalmological examinations among affected individuals in these 5 families were suggestive of retinitis pigmentosa. The genome-wide linkage scan localized the disease interval to chromosome 6p harboring TULP1 in 1 of 5 families and sequential analyses identified a single base pair substitution in TULP1 that results in threonine to alanine substitution p.T380A. Subsequently we investigated our entire cohort of families with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and identified 4 additional families with linkage to chromosome 6p all of them harboring a single base pair substitution in TULP1 that results in lysine to arginine substitution p.K489R. Results of single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotype analyses were suggestive of a common founder in these 4 families. CONCLUSION Pathogenic mutations in TULP1 are responsible for the autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa phenotype in these consanguineous Pakistani families with a single ancestral mutation in TULP1 causing the disease phenotype in 4 of 5 families. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Clinical and molecular characterization of pathogenic mutations in TULP1 will increase our understanding of retinitis pigmentosa at a molecular level.",

Neuraminidases of all viruses tested cleaved both 2-3- and 2-6-linked sialosides but preferred 2-3-linked ones and the activity was dependent on the terminal sialic acid structure. In contrast to NAs of other subtypes of influenza A viruses which did not cleave 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonic acid Kdn or 5-deoxy Kdn 5d-Kdn NAs of all N7 subtype viruses tested had noticeable hydrolytic activities on 2-3-linked sialosides containing Kdn or 5d-Kdn.

The method relies on the exposure of the sample to short-wavelength ultraviolet UV radiation in air and the ozone environment generated by a medium pressure mercury lamp 184-257nm. The generality of the approach has been confirmed using three test-cases of microporous materials a high-silica synthetic zeolite an aluminophosphate and a Ge-substituted microporous silica. The structures and organic contents of the microporous materials before and after UV ozone treatment were determined using a combination of X-ray diffraction Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy thermogravimetry and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. For all three cases the UVOzone treatment allows complete removal of the organic template while retaining the inorganic framework. The overall integrity of the microporous materials was comparable to or better than for materials derived by thermal calcination. This method is applicable in making new materials from organic-inorganic precursors and holds promise for microporous thin films on thermally sensitive substrates and for controlled spatial patterning. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This work conducted technoeconomic analysis in SuperPro Designer to compare the process economics of both microencapsulation systems initially for encapsulating emulsified fish oil. At all production scales examined the capital investment and annual operating cost were lower for the CLAMs process. The CLAMs process economic advantage stemmed from reducing the number of unit procedures. Upon modifying the models for microencapsulating hydrophilic cargo e.g. enzymes vitamins microbial concentrates the CLAMs process remained favorable at all cargo material costs and cargo loadings examined. This work demonstrates the utility of technoeconomic analysis for evaluating microencapsulation processes and may justify applying the CLAMs process at the industrial scale.",

However this graph-based framework faces challenges when there are repeated observations in the sequence which is often the case for discrete data such as network data. In this article we extend the graph-based framework to solve this problem by averaging or taking the union of all possible optimal graphs resulting from repeated observations. We consider both the single-changepoint alternative and the changed-interval alternative and derive analytical formulas to control the Type I error for the new methods making them readily applicable to large datasets. The extended methods are illustrated on an application in detecting changes in a sequence of dynamic networks over time. All proposed methods are implemented in an R package gSeg available on CRAN.",

    "abstract": "This paper evaluates the performance of a new type of PET detectors called sensitivity encoded silicon photomultiplier SeSP which allows a direct coupling of small-pitch crystal arrays to the detector with a reduction in the number of readout channels. Four SeSP devices with two separate encoding schemes of 1D and 2D were investigated in this study. Furthermore both encoding schemes were manufactured in two different sizes of 4 4mm2 and 7. 73 7. 9mm2 in order to investigate the effect of size on detector parameters. All devices were coupled to LYSO crystal arrays with 1 mm pitch size and 10 mm height with optical isolation between crystals. The characterization was done for the key parameters of crystal-identification energy resolution and time resolution as a function of triggering threshold and over-voltage OV. Position information was archived using the center of gravity CoG algorithm and a least squares approach LSQA in combination with a mean light matrix around the photo-peak. The positioning results proved the capability of all four SeSP devices in precisely identifying all crystals coupled to the sensors. Energy resolution was measured at different bias voltages varying from 12 to 18 FWHM and paired coincidence time resolution pCTR of 384 ps to 1.1 ns was obtained for different SeSP devices at about 18C room temperature. However the best time resolution was achieved at the highest over-voltage resulting in a noise ratio of 99.08.",

Here we test a counterintuitive consequence of the hypothesis that six-month-old infants are unable to bind colors to locations When comparing two successive stimulus arrays these infants will often compare noncorresponding items making it impossible for them to distinguish between identical arrays and nonidentical arrays. As a result they will not show a preference for changing arrays over nonchanging arrays even when all of the items change. We tested this prediction by presenting 6- and 7-month-old infants N 36 with nonchanging displays of three items and changing displays in which all three items simultaneoulsy changed colors. As predicted 7-month-old infants but not 6-month-old infants responded to the difference between these changing and nonchanging displays providing additional evidence that the ability to bind colors to locations develops rapidly across this age range.",

Elucidating the role of this interactions requires studies over an extensive range of energy momentum length and time scales. We show that immersion lens-based momentum microscopy with spin-resolution is able to combine these seemingly divergent requirements in a unifying experimental approach. We will discuss applications to different areas in information research for example resistive switching and spintronics. The analysis of resistive switching phenomena in oxides requires high lateral resolution and chemical selectivity as the processes involve local redox processes and oxygen vacancy migration. In spintronics topological phenomena are currently a hot topic which lead to complex band structures and spin textures in reciprocal space. Spin-resolved momentum microscopy is uniquely suited to address these aspects.",

Nearly all such studies in humans have focused only on males. With this preliminary study we provide basic and novel information on the involvement of OT and AVP in autism with an investigation of blood plasma levels of these neuropeptides in 75 preadolescent and adolescent girls and boys ages 8-18 40 with high-functioning ASD 19 girls 21 boys and 35 typically developing children 16 girls 19 boys. We related neuropeptide levels to social language repetitive behavior and internalizing symptom measures in these individuals. There were significant gender effects Girls showed higher levels of OT while boys had significantly higher levels of AVP. There were no significant effects of diagnosis on OT or AVP. Higher OT values were associated with greater anxiety in all girls and with better pragmatic language in all boys and girls. AVP levels were positively associated with restricted and repetitive behaviors in girls with ASD but negatively nonsignificantly associated with these behaviors in boys with ASD. Our results challenge the prevailing view that plasma OT levels are lower in individuals with ASD and suggest that there are distinct and sexually dimorphic mechanisms of action for OT and AVP underlying anxiety and repetitive behaviors.

The high organic content of CS could be utilized for biogas production but the direct digestion without pretreatment always leads to a low methane yield and biodegradability due to the complicated structure of lignocellulose. In order to search best fitting pretreatment methods in effective anaerobic digestion AD of CS effects of various pretreatments including KOH NaOH CaOH2 alkali hydrogen peroxide AHP H2SO4 H3PO4 and steam explosion SE were studied. It was seen that all treatments resulted in varying methane yields. Among all the pretreatments acid pretreatment is not suitable for AD of CS. The results showed that the highest cumulative methane yield CMY of 192.4 mLgVS-1 was obtained after 3 AHP pretreatment of CS and the methane yield improved by 254.3 than the untreated CS. Therefore AHP treatment was proven to be an efficient pretreatment technique. XRD and FTIR analyses had shown that pretreated CS had favorable structural changes.

We used a cultural adaptation approach to develop a graphic novella for Chinese LEP immigrants about how to call 911 and perform bystander CPR. Collaboration with members of this community occurred through all stages of novella development. One hundred and thirty-two LEP Chinese adults read the novella and answered a survey measuring behavioral intentions. All respondents stated they would call 911 after witnessing a persons collapse but those previously trained in CPR were more likely to say that they would perform CPR. All participants indicated that they would recommend this novella to others.

    "abstract": "In the vertebrate retina combinations of Notch ligands receptors and ternary complex components determine the destiny of retinal progenitor cells by regulating Hes effector gene activity. Owing to reiterated Notch signaling in numerous tissues throughout development there are multiple vertebrate paralogues for nearly every node in this pathway. These Notch signaling components can act redundantly or in a compensatory fashion during development. To dissect the complexity of this pathway during retinal development we used seven germline or conditional mutant mice and two spatiotemporally distinct Cre drivers. We perturbed the Notch ternary complex and multiple Hes genes with two overt goals in mind. First we wished to determine if Notch signaling is required in the optic stalknerve head for Hes1 sustained expression and activity. Second we aimed to test if Hes1 3 and 5 genes are functionally redundant during early retinal histogenesis. With our allelic series we found that disrupting Notch signaling consistently blocked mitotic growth and overproduced ganglion cells but we also identified two significant branchpoints for this pathway. In the optic stalknerve head sustained Hes1 is regulated independent of Notch signaling whereas during photoreceptor genesis both Notch-dependent and -independent roles for Rbpj and Hes1 impact photoreceptor genesis in opposing manners.",

However little is known about the inoculum source population structure and genetic diversity of the pathogen or the mechanisms of dissemination within Lebanon. To understand the population structure a total of 203 isolates sampled from olive n 78 and potato n 125 were characterized for species mating type and race and the genetic relationships were delineated using 13 microsatellite markers. All isolates except one from potato were V. dahliae with 55.1 and 12.1 race 1 and 43.6 and 83.1 race 2 in olive and potato respectively. The genetic structure of the studied population was best described by two large and two small clusters. Membership in the two large clusters was determined by the presence or absence of the effector gene Ave1. Furthermore genetic structure was moderately associated with the host of origin but was weakly associated with the geographic origin. All but four isolates represented by three multilocus haploid genotypes were MAT1-2. This study identified a clear lack of gene flow between virulence genotypes of V. dahliae despite the proximity of these cropping systems and the wide distribution of genetic diversity among hosts and geographic regions in Lebanon.",

We provide a graph-theoretic definition of power-counting for multi-loop integrands beyond the planar limit and show how this can be used to organize bases according to ultraviolet behavior. This allows amplitude integrands to be constructed iteratively. We illustrate these ideas with concrete applications. In particular we describe complete integrand bases at two loops sufficient to represent arbitrary-multiplicity amplitudes in four or fewer dimensions in any massless quantum field theory with the ultraviolet behavior of the Standard Model or better. We also comment on possible extensions of our framework to arbitrary including regulated numbers of dimensions and to theories with arbitrary mass spectra and charges. At three loops we describe a basis sufficient to capture all leading-transcendental-weight contributions of any four-dimensional quantum theory for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory this basis should be sufficient to represent all scattering amplitude integrands in the theory for generic helicities and arbitrary multiplicity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Previous studies comparing reoperation risk between integrated dual lag screw IDL and single lag component SL cephalomedullary nails CMNs in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures have demonstrated mixed results. The purpose of this study was to assess the rates of reoperation for fixation failure and all-cause reoperation in a large multi-institutional cohort of patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with an IDL or SL CMN. We hypothesized that there would be no difference between the groups with respect to either of the reoperation rates. METHODS Adults 18 years old who sustained an intertrochanteric fracture AOOTA 31A1 to 31A3 treated with an IDL or SL CMN between January 2014 and May 2021 at 1 of 13 Level-I trauma centers were included. Patients with 3 months of follow-up or pathologic fractures were excluded. Rates of reoperation were compared with use of the chi-square test and multivariable regression controlling for age gender injury mechanism fracture pattern and postoperative neck-shaft angle. RESULTS A total of 2130 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 78 years and 62.5 of patients were female. The cohort consisted of 287 patients 13.5 with an IDL CMN and 1843 patients 86.5 with an SL CMN. A total of 99 patients 4.6 had a reoperation of any type of whom 29 1.4 of all patients had a reoperation for fixation failure. Compared with patients with an SL CMN those with an IDL CMN had higher rates 4.2 versus 0.9 p 0.001 and odds odds ratio OR 4.95 95 confidence interval CI 2.29 to 10.69 p 0.001 of reoperation for fixation failure as well as higher rates 7.3 versus 4.2 p 0.021 and odds OR 1.83 95 CI 1.10 to 3.06 p 0.021 of all-cause reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Intertrochanteric femoral fractures treated with an IDL CMN were associated with low but significantly higher rates and significantly higher odds of reoperation for fixation failure and all-cause reoperation compared with those treated with an SL CMN. We suggest caution to surgeons in the use of IDL CMNs for high-risk patients and recommend using SL CMNs for most patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures.

These bounds yield a simple condition under which Grassmannian frames coincide with unit norm tight frames. We exploit connections to graph theory equiangular line sets and coding theory in order to derive explicit constructions of Grassmannian frames. Our findings extend recent results on unit norm tight frames. We then introduce infinite-dimensional Grassmannian frames and analyze their connection to unit norm tight frames for frames which are generated by group-like unitary systems. We derive an example of a Grassmannian Gabor frame by using connections to sphere packing theory.

PCR experiments performed with specific primers showed that this species is also expressed in the mouth organs and in the cuticle while the other two are antennal specific. All three isoforms are similar to Drosophila OS-D and other proteins reported in several insect orders but one of them is significantly different from the other two. The best conserved elements are the N-terminal region and the four cysteine residues. Accurate ESMS measurements indicated that all cysteines are involved in two disulphide bonds and ruled out the occurrence of additional post-translational modifications.

    "abstract": "We present a new block-based preconditioner for simulating all-speed compressible flow with phase change. The conservation equations are discretized with a reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin method and integrated in time with fully implicit time discretization schemes. The resulting set of non-linear equations is converged using a robust Newton-Krylov framework. Due to the stiffness of the underlying physics associated with stiff acoustic waves and viscous material strength effects we solve for the primitive-variables pressure velocity and temperature. To enable convergence of the highly ill-conditioned linearized systems we develop a physics-based preconditioner utilizing approximate block factorization techniques to reduce the fully-coupled 33 system to a pair of reduced 22 systems. We demonstrate that our preconditioned Newton-Krylov framework converges on very stiff multi-physics problems with excellent algorithmic and parallel scalability. Results are shown for the classic lid-driven cavity flow problem as well as for 3D laser-induced phase change.",

Equine sarcoid was the most common tumor in our study accounting for 72 of all tumors and 82 of cutaneous tumors. Soft-tissue sarcomas were the second most common skin tumors. All other types of neoplasia were rare. Important differences in the occurrence of neoplasia in donkeys compared to horses included the rarity or absence of squamous cell carcinoma in any organ system and gray horse melanoma. Lymphosarcoma the most common malignant tumor in horses appears to be very rare in donkeys. We report several tumors in donkeys including melanocytoma peripheral nerve sheath tumor and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Our data demonstrate commonalities as well as differences in neoplastic diseases of donkeys and horses. Understanding differences in carcinogenesis among these 2 closely related species can inform researchers pursuing pathogenic mechanisms of equine disease and inform veterinary diagnosticians regarding tumor prevalence.",

Astrocytes have many functions in the brain including a role in higher cognitive functions and in inflammatory brain processes. Therefore an alteration in number function andor activation state of astrocytes could be present in ASD. We quantified astrocyte number in the gray and white matter of the prefrontal cortex-BA9 BA46 and BA47-in 15 ASD and 15 age- and sex-matched control cases. We labeled astrocytes with antibodies against the protein GFAP and S100 markers of astrocytes. We found a significant decrease in the number of astrocytes in the gray and white matter of all prefrontal areas of interest with both markers. We also found an increased state of activation of GFAP astrocytes in all areas. A reduced number of astrocytes in the cerebral cortex in ASD could lead to impaired synaptic function and disrupted connectivity. An increased astrocyte activation may indicate a chronic mild inflammatory state of the cerebral cortex in ASD. Overall we found that astrocytes are disrupted in ASD.",

    "abstract": "A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field FF is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF C27 and C27r systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature selected torsional Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical QM and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 12-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine DPPC bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids DPPC 12-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine DMPC 12-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine DLPC 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine POPC 12-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine DOPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine POPE simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2 and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters SCD are well predicted with the new FF including proper splitting of the SCD for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC POPE and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of 13C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly the presented lipid FF referred to as C36 allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble NPT and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The measurement of hospital quality based on outcomes requires risk adjustment. The c-statistic is a popular tool used to judge model performance but can be limited particularly when evaluating specific operations in focused populations. Our objectives were to examine the interpretation and relevance of the c-statistic when used in models with increasingly similar case mix and to consider an alternative perspective on model calibration based on a graphical depiction of model fit. STUDY DESIGN From the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2008-2009 patients were identified who underwent a general surgery procedure and procedure groups were increasingly restricted colorectal-all colorectal-elective cases only and colorectal-elective cancer cases only. Mortality and serious morbidity outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression-based risk adjustment and model c-statistics and calibration curves were used to compare model performance. RESULTS During the study period 323427 general 47605 colorectal-all 39860 colorectal-elective and 21680 colorectal cancer patients were studied. Mortality ranged from 1.0 in general surgery to 4.1 in the colorectal-all group and serious morbidity ranged from 3.9 in general surgery to 12.4 in the colorectal-all procedural group. As case mix was restricted c-statistics progressively declined from the general to the colorectal cancer surgery cohorts for both mortality and serious morbidity mortality 0.949 to 0.866 serious morbidity 0.861 to 0.668. Calibration was evaluated graphically by examining predicted vs observed number of events over risk deciles. For both mortality and serious morbidity there was no qualitative difference in calibration identified between the procedure groups. CONCLUSIONS In the present study we demonstrate how the c-statistic can become less informative and in certain circumstances can lead to incorrect model-based conclusions as case mix is restricted and patients become more homogenous. Although it remains an important tool caution is advised when the c-statistic is advanced as the sole measure of a model performance.",

Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. display a unique large expansion of immunodominant outer membrane proteins facilitating antigenic variation. All Rickettsiales have a diminished ability to synthesize amino acids compared to their closest free-living relatives. Unlike members of the Rickettsiaceae family these pathogenic Anaplasmataceae are capable of making all major vitamins cofactors and nucleotides which could confer a beneficial role in the invertebrate vector or the vertebrate host. Further analysis identified proteins potentially involved in vacuole confinement of the Anaplasmataceae a life cycle involving a hematophagous vector vertebrate pathogenesis human pathogenesis and lack of transovarial transmission.

This report summarizes conclusions of an international multidisciplinary consensus group assembled to address evaluation and treatment of patients with thoracic outlet syndrome TOS a group of conditions characterized by extrinsic compression of the neurovascular structures serving the upper extremity. The following recommendations were developed in relation to the three defined types of TOS neurogenic venous and arterial and three phases of pandemic response preparatory urgent with limited resources and emergency with complete diversion of resources. In-person evaluation and treatment for neurogenic TOS interventional or surgical are generally postponed during all pandemic phases with telephonetelemedicine visits and at-home physical therapy exercises recommended when feasible. Venous TOS presenting with acute upper extremity deep venous thrombosis Paget-Schroetter syndrome is managed primarily with anticoagulation with percutaneous interventions for venous TOS thrombolysis considered in early phases I and II and surgical treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve. Catheter-based interventions may also be considered for selected patients with central subclavian vein obstruction and threatened hemodialysis access in all pandemic phases with definitive surgical treatment postponed. Evaluation and surgical treatment for arterial TOS should be reserved for limb-threatening situations such as acute upper extremity ischemia or acute digital embolization in all phases of pandemic response. In late pandemic phases surgery should be restricted to thrombolysis or brachial artery thromboembolectomy with more definitive treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve.",

    "abstract": "PROBLEM RESEARCH STRATEGY AND FINDINGS The 1968 Fair Housing Act required local government recipients of federal money to take meaningful actions to affirmatively further fair housing AFFH. Current fair housing analysis requirements are copious but do not request an assessment of how land use policies affect the potential for neighborhood integration. A recent California law requires local governments to include AFFH analysis in existing planning processes and state guidelines encourage the measurement of the spatial distribution of planned sites for low-income housing with respect to opportunity. We propose and evaluate a fair housing land use score FHLUS that measures whether local governments land use policies promote inclusion across neighborhoods. We illustrate the FHLUS by examining zoning and housing plans for three municipalities in California that differ in terms of neighborhood variation in incomes. In all three cases we found that municipal zoning and housing plans exacerbated patterns of segregation rather than reversed them. Our metric is more precise than existing approaches but all measures of this phenomenon will be less useful in smaller more homogenous jurisdictions. The analysis raises important questions about the geographic scale and outcome measures for AFFH analysis and expectations for municipalities of different sizes and levels of diversity. TAKEAWAY FOR PRACTICE Our metric is a useful tool for advocates and planners at all levels of government. We recommend the federal government consider incorporating it into the AFFH toolkit and practicing planners employ the measure to analyze local zoning and investment decisions.

Our hospital archives were searched for all cases of Bartholin gland carcinoma from 1984 to 2017 n16. We excluded 3 adenoid cystic carcinomas which were the subject of a previous study leaving 13 cases. We reviewed all slides and performed immunostains for p16 as a surrogate biomarker for high-risk HPV. There were 12 squamous cell carcinomas SCCs including 1 SCC with transitional-like morphology and 1 papillary SCC and 1 adenocarcinoma. All SCCs showed diffuse and intense p16 expression consistent with the presence of HPV. The single case of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showed patchy staining. Patient age ranged from 38 to 72 yr mean 58.3 yr. Most tumors were low stage. All patients were treated with radical vulvectomy and inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Mean clinical follow-up was 53.7 mo range 3-181 mo 9 patients were free of disease 75 recurrence occurred in 3 cases with death due to disease in 2 of the patients with recurrence including the single patient with adenocarcinoma. All SCC of Bartholin gland expressed p16 diffusely and intensely regardless of histologic features and grade. Our results support the etiologic role of HPV in the pathogenesis of SCC of Bartholin gland. In this small study we observed SCC as the predominant histotype and most tumors presented at early stage and were associated with relatively favorable outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In a longitudinal data set of married couples Meltzer McNulty Jackson and Karney 2014 reported that partner physical attractiveness is more strongly associated with relationship satisfaction for men than for women. Although a recent meta-analysis Eastwick Luchies Finkel Hunt in press provided no support for this sex difference across 97 samples and 30000 participants Meltzer et al. 2014 responded by outlining 7 criteria required for an appropriate test of the sex difference these criteria eliminate all but 1 study from the meta-analysis. In this commentary we raise 3 concerns about Meltzer et al.s contribution. First there is weak theoretical and empirical support for the criteria they used to dismiss the relevance of the meta-analysis studies. Second if one adds Meltzer et al.s data to the meta-analysis all the sex differences remain extremely small and nonsignificant even if one focuses only on studies that best conform to Meltzer et al.s criteria i.e. married samples objective attractiveness measures. Third a new data set meeting all 7 criteria fails to replicate the Meltzer et al. sex difference in contrast data revealed that physical attractiveness is if anything more strongly associated with the trajectory of relationship satisfaction for women than for men. As noted by Eastwick Luchies et al. in press in paradigms where participants evaluate partners they have at a minimum met face-to-face the sex difference in the association of physical attractiveness with romantic evaluations is a extremely small on average and b unlinked to all cross-study characteristics identified to date.",

While the risks of central line associated blood stream infections CLABSI in burn patients have been well studied the risks of PICC infections have yet to be fully elucidated. A retrospective chart review was performed of all burn patients with a PICC admitted to our regional burn center from 2006 to 2008. Information collected included age total body surface area TBSA burn injury length of hospital stay duration of PICC line insertion hospital day of PICC line insertion and development of infections. All mean values are presented as the mean standard error. A total of 56 patients received a PICC during this time period. Eight patients developed PICC infections with an overall rate of 11.71000 catheter days. Burn patient CLABSI for the same time period was 12.91000 catheter days. Duration of PICC did not differ between infected and noninfected patients 13.3 6 vs. 12.1 9.6 days. Patients with PICC infections had a higher percentage of TBSA 42.7 3.2 vs. 20.6 2.4 longer length of admission 72.4 6 vs. 35 3.2 and later hospital day of PICC insertion 48 4.6 vs. 17.1 2.5. On linear regression analysis PICC infection was significantly associated with TBSA B 22.1 length of admission B 37.4 and hospital day of PICC insertion B 30.3. On multivariate analysis TBSA Odds ratio OR 1.05 length of admission OR 1.04 and hospital day of PICC insertion OR 1.05 all independently increased the risk of developing a PICC infection. Patients with severe burn injury long hospital admissions and later hospital day of PICC insertions are at higher risk of developing PICC infections. This data suggests that protocols should be developed about routine PICC changes in this high-risk burn population.",

Burn injuries result in various extents of injury body areas affected and types of skin graft surgeries needed-all of which may influence the type timing safety and outcome of mobilization activities. This study surveyed burn clinicians to determine current mobility practices and the influence of skin graft surgery on clinical decisions to mobilize patients. A 32-question survey was electronically distributed to burn clinicians and included questions about postoperative range of motion ROM and out of bed OOB mobility practices for various skin graft types and locations. For all types of grafts on all body locations the average time after skin graft surgery that patients resumed ROM activities was postoperative day POD 3.87 2.04 while OOB mobility resumed on POD 2.54 1.38. There was significantly greater variability for OOB mobility compared to ROM coefficient of variation CV 0.71 0.8 vs 0.5 0.05. Time to postoperative ROM was significantly different depending on the type of skin graft placed with sheet skin grafts resuming ROM the earliest. Time to OOB mobility after surgery was significantly different for different body locations with grafts placed above the waist resuming OOB mobility earliest. This study provides a summary of current mobility practices and serves as a foundation for future studies investigating the optimal timing and practical application of mobility protocols that may influence safety and outcome of burn survivors.",

DESIGN Uncontrolled clinical trial. SETTING Five academic medical centers across California. PATIENTS Premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas uterus size 16 weeks size and all leiomyomas 10 cm with no more than 6 total leiomyomas. INTERVENTIONS Laparoscopic RFA of leiomyomas. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We assessed intraoperative complications blood loss operative time and adverse events. Gynecologists reported the operative difficulty and need for further training after each case. Participants reported leiomyoma symptoms preoperatively and at 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. We analyzed all outcome data from the first case performed by gynecologists with no previous RFA experience. Patient demand for RFA was high but poor insurance authorization prevented 74 of eligible women from trial participation 26 women underwent surgery and were enrolled. The mean age of the participants was 41.5 4.9 years. The mean operating time was 153 51 minutes and mean estimated blood loss was 24 40 cc. There were no intraoperative complications and no major adverse events. Menstrual bleeding sexual function and quality of life symptoms improved significantly from baseline to 12 weeks with a 25 18-point or 47 decrease in the Leiomyoma Symptom Severity Score. After the first procedure the mean difficulty score was 6 95 confidence interval CI 4-7.5 on a 10-point scale and 89 of surgeons felt very or somewhat confident in performing laparoscopic RFA. The difficulty score decreased to 4.25 95 CI 1.2-6 after the fourth procedure with all gynecologists reporting surgical confidence. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic RFA of leiomyomas can be introduced into surgical practice with good clinical outcomes for patients. Gynecologists with no previous experience are able to gain confidence and skill with the procedure in fewer than 5 cases.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate lens drives current through itself in a pattern which concentrates current efflux at the lens equator. Lens epithelial cells LECs move into this region where they change shape and differentiate into lens fibre cells. The mechanisms underpinning these cell behaviors are unclear. We have attempted to mimic in isolation the effects which such electrical signals have on LEC behaviors by culturing LECs in a physiological DC electric field EF similar to that in lens. Primary human PHLECs primary bovine PBLECs and a transformed human cell line THLECs all changed shape to lie perpendicular to the EF the same orientation which LECs adopt with respect to the equatorial EF as they differentiate into lens fibre cells. Exposure to an EF also significantly increased the migration rate of all three LEC types. All three LECs also showed directed cell migration although curiously different cell types moved in different directions. PBLECs and THLECs showed voltage-dependent anode-directed migration with a response threshold between 100-150 mV mm-1and 25-50 mV mm-1 respectively. Small sheets of THLECs also migrated anodally. By contrast PHLECs migrated cathodally with a response threshold below 100 mV mm-1. Reversing the polarity reversed the migration direction for each cell type. These observations raise three possibilities 1 that small electric field may be one of the cues regulating lens epithelial cell behaviors in vivo 2 that altering the in vivo electric field by lens replacement may contribute to the aberrant migration of epithelial cells in conditions such as posterior capsule opacification and 3 that applying electric fields may be one way of controlling aberrant lens epithelial cell behaviors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Metagenomic next-generation sequencing NGS of cerebrospinal fluid CSF has the potential to identify a broad range of pathogens in a single test. METHODS In a 1-year multicenter prospective study we investigated the usefulness of metagenomic NGS of CSF for the diagnosis of infectious meningitis and encephalitis in hospitalized patients. All positive tests for pathogens on metagenomic NGS were confirmed by orthogonal laboratory testing. Physician feedback was elicited by teleconferences with a clinical microbial sequencing board and by surveys. Clinical effect was evaluated by retrospective chart review. RESULTS We enrolled 204 pediatric and adult patients at eight hospitals. Patients were severely ill 48.5 had been admitted to the intensive care unit and the 30-day mortality among all study patients was 11.3. A total of 58 infections of the nervous system were diagnosed in 57 patients 27.9. Among these 58 infections metagenomic NGS identified 13 22 that were not identified by clinical testing at the source hospital. Among the remaining 45 infections 78 metagenomic NGS made concurrent diagnoses in 19. Of the 26 infections not identified by metagenomic NGS 11 were diagnosed by serologic testing only 7 were diagnosed from tissue samples other than CSF and 8 were negative on metagenomic NGS owing to low titers of pathogens in CSF. A total of 8 of 13 diagnoses made solely by metagenomic NGS had a likely clinical effect with 7 of 13 guiding treatment. CONCLUSIONS Routine microbiologic testing is often insufficient to detect all neuroinvasive pathogens. In this study metagenomic NGS of CSF obtained from patients with meningitis or encephalitis improved diagnosis of neurologic infections and provided actionable information in some cases.

The advantages of AON include large-bandwidth provisioning lowlatency transmission and low energy consumption. The basic concept underlying AON is transmission of data signals entirely through the optical domain from source to destination nodes with no optical-electrical-optical O-E-O conversion at intermediate nodes. The technologies used to implement AON have undergone a series of evolutions which encompass time division multiplexing TDM frequency division multiplexing FDM and space division multiplexing SDM. Multi-dimensional AON MD-AON which leads the trend of AONs future architecture provides a vibrant state for emerging applications such as cloud computing and Internet of Things IoT. In this article we review the evolution of AON architectures based on the different all optical switching and multiplexing technologies i.e. TDM FDM and SDM which is one of the main areas of focus in this article. The other main area is detailed discussion of implementations such as data plane and control plane technologies as well as resource optimization technologies for realizing AON. We also introduce several AON testbeds with their compositions and functions and some potential application scenarios that can be implemented based on these testbeds",

    "abstract": "To advance ongoing efforts to diversify the healthcare field and promote inclusion in physiology education the present study investigates the potential for an evidence-based intervention Scientist Spotlight assignments to highlight counterstereotypical representations of scientists in the context of majors and nonmajors physiology courses. Undergraduate students at an emerging Hispanic serving R1 institution completed six Scientist Spotlights assignments in their physiology courses. We conducted semistructured interviews and disseminated an established pre- and postsurvey protocol at the beginning and end of the courses. Our findings from interviews with 31 students from a range of marginalized backgrounds revealed that 1 the biographical information about counterstereotypical scientists deeply resonated with students by humanizing science 2 the instructors implementation of the assignments made a meaningful difference in their feelings of inclusion and 3 the assignments supported students beliefs about their content learning and understanding of physiological concepts. The results from the survey showed that regardless of being in a major n 159 or nonmajor n 117 course students from a range of demographic groups can and do significantly shift in their relatability to and descriptions of scientists. We highlight implications for inclusive curricula like Scientist Spotlights for addressing the issue of representation in physiology textbooks curriculum and healthcare fields at large.NEW NOTEWORTHY Scientist Spotlights significantly enhance undergraduate students feelings of inclusion and learning in undergraduate physiology courses at an emerging Hispanic-serving institution. By engaging with assignments featuring counterstereotypical scientists students in both majors and nonmajors physiology courses shifted in their relatability to and descriptions of scientists. These results suggest that an inclusive curriculum combined with supportive instructor practices can positively impact student success and representation in physiology education.",

    "abstract": "Leakage currents in on-chip SRAMs caches branch predictor register files and TLBs are major contributors to the energy dissipated by processors in deep sub-micron technologies. High leakage also increases chip temperature and some SRAM-based structures become thermal hotspots. Previous work has addressed major sources of SRAM leakage in memory cells and bit-lines making remaining SRAM components in particular large drivers the primary source of leakage. This paper proposes an approach to reduce this source of leakage in all major SRAM-based units of the processor controlling them in a uniform way yet treating each unit individually based on its behavior and memory organization. The new approach uses multiple bias voltages in sleep transistors allowing a trade-off between leakage reduction and wakeup delay in multi-stage peripheral drivers. Four low-power modes are defined from basic to ultra low power and SRAMs dynamically transition between these modes to minimize leakage without sacrificing performance. A novel control mechanism monitors and predicts future processor behavior for mode control. The leakage reduction in individual units is evaluated and shown to vary from 25 for IL1 to 75 for L2 caches. Resulting temperature reduction including the effect of positive feedback between temperature and leakage power is evaluated. A significant temperature reduction is achieved in each unit. It is also shown to reduce hot spots in the instruction TLB and branch predictor. 2010 ACM.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND As US health care increasingly focuses on outcomes as a means for quantifying quality there is a growing demand for risk models that can account for the variability of patients treated at different hospitals so that equitable comparisons between institutions can be made. We sought to apply aspects of prior risk-standardization methodology to begin development of a risk-standardization tool for the National Cardiovascular Data Registry NCDR IMPACT Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment Registry. METHODS AND RESULTS Using IMPACT we identified all patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization between January 2011 and March 2013. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of experiencing a major adverse event after cardiac catheterization. A total of 19608 cardiac catheterizations were performed between January 2011 and March 2013. Among all cases a major adverse event occurred in 378 of all cases 1.9. After multivariable adjustment 8 variables were identified as critical for risk standardization patient age renal insufficiency single-ventricle physiology procedure-type risk group low systemic saturation low mixed venous saturation elevated systemic ventricular end-diastolic pressure and elevated main pulmonary artery pressures. The model had good discrimination C statistic 0.70 confirmed by bootstrap validation validation C statistic 0.69. CONCLUSIONS Using prior risk-standardization efforts as a foundation we developed and internally validated a model to predict the occurrence of a major adverse event after cardiac catheterization for congenital heart disease. Future efforts should be directed toward further refinement of the model variables within this large multicenter data set.",

Design leads that could expand the recognition code to all four Watson-Crick base pairs would provide one step toward a general solution targeting single sites in megabase size DNA. The nonnatural deoxyribonucleoside 1-2-deoxy--D-ribofuranosyl-4-3-benzamidophenylimidazole D3 was synthesized in four steps and incorporated by automated methods into pyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Within a pyrimidine oligonucleotide D3 binds pyrimidine-purine base pairs with higher affinity than it binds purine-pyrimidine base pairs. From affinity-cleaving analysis the stabilities of base triplets decrease in the order D3TA D3CG D3AT D3GC. Such specificity allows binding by triple-helix formation at an 18 base pair site in SV40 DNA containing all four base pairs at physiologically relevant pH and temperature. The stabilities of these novel triplets may be an example of shape-selective recognition of CG and TA Watson-Crick base pairs in the major groove. 1992 American Chemical Society.

    "abstract": "West Nile virus WNV is an important agent of human encephalitis that has quickly become endemic across much of the United States since its identification in North America in 1999. While the majority 75 of infections are subclinical neurologic disease can occur in a subset of cases with outcomes including permanent neurologic damage and death. Currently there are no WNV vaccines approved for use in humans. This study introduces a novel vaccine platform for WNV to reduce viral replication in the central nervous system while maintaining peripheral replication to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers. Vaccine candidates were engineered to incorporate microRNA miRNA target sequences for a cognate miRNA expressed only in neurons allowing the host miRNAs to target viral transcription through endogenous RNA silencing. To maintain stability these targets were incorporated in multiple locations within the 3-untranslated region flanking sequences essential for viral replication without affecting the viral open reading frame. All candidates replicated comparably to wild type WNV in vitro within cells that did not express the cognate miRNA. Insertional control viruses were also capable of neuroinvasion and neurovirulence in vivo in CD-1 mice. Vaccine viruses were safe at all doses tested and did not demonstrate mutations associated with a reversion to virulence when serially passaged in mice. All vaccine constructs were protective from lethal challenge in mice producing 93-100 protection at the highest dose tested. Overall this is a safe and effective attenuation strategy with broad potential application for vaccine development.",

This article fills the current void by presenting evidence on the 1997 New York City Police Department work slowdown to my knowledge the longest documented police slowdown in U.S. history. Drawing on several originally collected data sources from the NYPD and other city agencies the article assesses the impact of the slowdown on ticket enforcement arrest enforcement and crime. The findings indicate that at least in the context of contract-motivated slowdowns where the union may be motivated to garner public support for pay increases the effects on public safety may be limited. Specifically in the case of the 1997 slowdown ticketwriting for all categories of tickets fell dramatically but arrest enforcement for all types of serious crime stayed the same or increased. Accordingly the crime effects were mostly concentrated in the area of minor criminal disorder misdemeanors and violations. Only two categories of serious crime larcenies and assaults were affected and those crime increases were minimal.",

    "abstract": "Recently we suggested a reformulation of general relativity which completely sequesters from gravity all of the vacuum energy from a protected matter sector assumed to contain the standard model. Here we elaborate further on the mechanism presenting additional details of how it cancels all loop corrections and renders all contributions from phase transitions automatically small. We also consider cosmological consequences in more detail and show that the mechanism is consistent with a variety of inflationary models that make a universe big and old. We discuss in detail the underlying assumptions behind the dynamics of our proposal and elaborate on the relationship of the physical interpretation of divergent operators in quantum field theory and the apparent acausality which our mechanism seems to entail which we argue is completely harmless. It is merely a reflection of the fact that any UV sensitive quantity in quantum field theory cannot be calculated from first principles but is an input whose numerical value must be measured. We also note that since the universe should be compact in spacetime and so will collapse in the future the current phase of acceleration with wDE-1 is just a transient. This could be tested by future cosmological observations.",

Onehundredthirtyfive canine and fortythree feline patients seen at the University of California Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital that received CPR between August 1987 and December 1991 were studied. Initial resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful in 72 of dogs and 58 of cats. Five dogs and one cat were still alive 3 days after CPR. Ultimately only four dogs and one cat were discharged from the hospital alive. These five patients with uniquely longer survival all had cardiac arrests associated with drug andor anesthetic reactions. Copyright 1992 Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",

Using the Perron-Frobenius theorem we show sufficient conditions are positivity of all interactions in the dual canonical basis of Lusztig. We characterize the cone of positive interactions showing that it is a simplicial cone consisting of all non-positive linear combinations of cascade operators a special new basis of U_qmathfraksl_2 intertwiners we define.

Due to observed datas categorical nature all comparisons among populations are performed by comparing their distributions in the form of a histogram with symbolic bins. A distance measure is designed to evaluate the discrepancy between two symbol-based histograms to facilitate Hierarchical Clustering HC algorithms. The resultant binary HC-tree then serves as the basis for our EDA task of discovering tree-patterns of interest. Since each population-leafs location within a binary HC-trees geometry is expressed through a binary code sequence a binary code segment characterizes all commonly shared tree-patterns for all members. We then generate a large ensemble of mimicries of the observed dataset based on multinomial distributions and construct a large ensemble of binary HC-trees. Upon each identified tree-pattern which we determined based on the observed dataset we evaluate its reliability and uncertainty through two histograms.",

DESIGN Retrospective multicenter analysis. SETTING Five level-one trauma centers. PATIENTSPARTICIPANTS Two hundred ten patients 152 F 58 M average age 64 with 112 left- and 98 right-sided low-energy proximal humerus fractures OTAAO 11-A-C. INTERVENTION All patients were initially treated nonoperatively and were followed for an average of 231 days. Radiographic translation in the sagittal and coronal planes was measured. Patients with anterior translation were compared with those with posterior or no translation. Patients with 80 anterior humeral translation were compared with those with 80 anterior translation including those with no or posterior translation. MAIN OUTCOMES The primary outcome was failure of nonoperative treatment resulting in surgery and the secondary outcome was symptomatic malunion. RESULTS Nine patients 4 had surgery 8 for nonunion and 1 for malunion. All 9 patients 100 had anterior translation. Anterior translation compared with posterior or no sagittal plane translation was associated with failure of nonoperative management requiring surgery P 0.012. In addition of those with anterior translation having 80 anterior translation compared with 80 was also associated with surgery P 0.001. Finally 26 patients were diagnosed with symptomatic malunion of whom translation was anterior in 24 and posterior in 2 P 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS In a multicenter series of proximal humerus fractures anterior translation of 80 was associated with failure of nonoperative care resulting in nonunion symptomatic malunion and potential surgery.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To conduct ophthalmic behavioral electrophysiological and genetic testing on two related Gordon setters presented for day blindness and compare findings with those of nine related and unrelated Gordon setters. METHODS All dogs underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination. Maze testing was conducted under different light intensities. Rod and cone function was assessed electroretinographically. DNA samples were screened for five canine retinal disease gene mutations. RESULTS Ophthalmic examination was unremarkable in all dogs. There was no notable difference between day blind dogs and the reference population in scotopic and mesopic maze tests. Day blind dogs performed worse in the photopic maze with slower course completion time and more obstacle collisions. Electroretinography revealed extinguished cone function in day blind dogs and depressed rod responses in all but two reference dogs. One reference population dog presented with day blindness 1 year after initial examination. Mutations that cause achromatopsia in CNGB3 and cone-rod dystrophies in ADAM9 and IQCB1 were not detected in any dog tested although five reference dogs were carriers of the mutation in C2orf71 that causes rod-cone degeneration 4 rcd4 in Gordon setters and in polski owczarek nizinny dogs. CONCLUSIONS This report describes a novel retinopathy in related Gordon setters that has clinical signs and vision testing results consistent with achromatopsia but electroretinographic results suggestive of cone-rod dystrophy. The majority of Gordon setters in this study had low rod responses on electroretinography but it is unclear whether this was indicative of rod dysfunction or normal for the breed. Longer-term observation of affected individuals is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Awareness of the many different connections between health and travel is growing. While safety has long been the pre-eminent health concern in the transportation field the health impacts of harmful pollutants became a public concern starting in the 1950s and concerns over a decline in active forms of travel rose to prominence in the last decade. Efforts to address these concerns recognize that driving has negative impacts on health while the alternatives can have positive impacts. Travel choices are thus central to all three health concerns. Strategies that aim to improve the healthiness of travel by changing these choices fall into three general categories reducing the harms of driving reducing the amount of driving and increasing the use of active travel modes. Many of these strategies are synergistic in that they help to address all three health concerns simultaneously and are more effective when employed together. Given the substantial connections between health and daily household travel it is important that health impacts be considered in the formation of transport policy. The movement towards sustainable transport planning offers an unprecedented opportunity to bring health considerations into the mainstream by recognizing health as a critical component of sustainability.",

This study describes the development of a set of rating scales used to measure four dimensions of disruptive behavior that present frequent problems in patients with dementia physical aggression verbal aggression agitation and wandering. In addition a total disruptive behavior scale is derived by averaging scores from these four scales. A sample of 16 patients in a skilled nursing facility was used to test interrater reliability and validity of this instrument. Interrater reliability was quite favorable for all scales. There was clear evidence for convergent validity of all scales except the verbal aggression scale where a substantial correlation was found with one relevant external measure but not the other. There was also favorable evidence of discriminant validity for all scales except the verbal aggression scale. Psychometric properties of this instrument appear to be promising and indicate that it has potential utility for further research on causes and treatments for disruptive behavior in demented patients.",

METHODS Utilizing data from the California Prescription Drug Monitoring Program we examined age and gender-specific trends of Schedule II opioid use during calendar years 1999-2007. Specifically we analyzed the following 1 the prevalence of Schedule II opioid users among Californias population and 2 the proportion of these opioid users who were doctor shoppers defined as an individual who used more than five different prescribers for all Schedule II opioids he or she obtained in a calendar year. RESULTS Among all age and gender groups the prevalence of Schedule II opioid users in California increased by 150-280 and the prevalence of doctor shoppers among users increased by 111-213 over 9 years. The prevalence of opioid users was lowest among 18-44 year old men 1.25 and highest among 65-year and older women 5.31 by 2007. The prevalence of doctor shoppers was approximately 1.4 among those up to age 64 years and 0.5 among those 65 years and older. The gender difference in doctor shoppers among all age groups was negligible. On average the cumulative morphine-equivalent amount of Schedule II opioid per individual obtained per year was threefold to sixfold higher for doctor shoppers than for the general population across different age and gender groups. CONCLUSIONS Age and gender differences in opioid use were relatively small whereas the trends for use of opioids and multiple providers grew at a disquieting rate.",

A 4 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used with the factors of dose 0.0 1.38 5.5 or 22.0 mgkg-1 DM basis and sex steers or heifers. Three 91-d cycles were conducted 112 cattlecycle with each dose sex combination being represented by a single cattle pen enclosure CPE 14 cattleCPE resulting in a total of 168 steers and 168 heifers n 6 replicatesdose. There were no interactions observed between dose and sex for any variable measured in the study P 0.063. Five gases were evaluated for all pens based on CPE concentrations relative to ambient air NH3 CH4 N2O H2S and CO2. Cumulative NH3 gas emissions were reduced by feeding cattle 5.5 and 22.0 mgkg-1 LUB P 0.023 and tended P 0.076 to be lower for the cattle fed 1.38 mgkg-1 LUB compared with the negative controls CON. The cumulative NH3 gas emission reductions of 960 to 1032 g coupled with HCW increases P 0.019 of 15 to 16 kg for all LUB doses vs. CON led to reductions in NH3 gas emissionskg HCW for all three LUB treatments P 0.004. Similar to HCW reductions in NH3 gas emissionskg of unshrunk final BW were observed for all LUB doses P 0.009 and were attributable to both decreases in NH3 gas emissions and numerical increases in BW.

    "abstract": "MOTIVATION The development of better tests to detect cancer in its earliest stages is one of the most sought-after goals in medicine. Especially important are minimally invasive tests that require only blood or urine samples. By profiling oligosaccharides cleaved from glycosylated proteins shed by tumor cells into the blood stream we hope to determine glycan profiles that will help identify cancer patients using a simple blood test. The data in this article were generated using matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry MALDI FT-ICR MS. We have developed novel methods for analyzing this type of mass spectrometry data and applied it to eight datasets from three different types of cancer breast ovarian and prostate. RESULTS The techniques we have developed appear to be effective in the analysis of MALDI FT-ICR MS data. We found significant differences between control and cancer groups in all eight datasets including two structurally related compounds that were found to be significantly different between control and cancer groups in all three types of cancer studied.",

Oxidant stress is especially toxic to excitable nerve and muscle cells cells that are often affected in mitochondrial disease. The sensitivity of cells bearing the LHON MELAS and MERRF mutations to oxidant stress was determined. All were significantly more sensitive to H2O2 exposure than their nonmutant cybrid controls the order of sensitivity was MELAS LHON MERRF controls. Depletion of Ca2 from the medium protected all cell lines from oxidant stress consistent with the hypothesis that death induced by oxidant stress is Ca2-dependent. A potential downstream target of Ca2 is the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT which is inhibited by cyclosporin A. Treatment of MELAS LHON and MERRF cells with cyclosporin A caused significant rescue from oxidant exposure and in each case significantly greater rescue of mutant than control cells. The pronounced oxidant-sensitivity of mutant cells and their protection by Ca2 depletion and CsA has potential implications for both the pathophysiological mechanism and therapy of these mitochondrial genetic diseases.",

A shortage of pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists currently exists in the United States and this shortage is likely to intensify because of the growing numbers of children with chronic health problems and special health care needs. It is equally important to maintain the supply of primary care pediatricians. The AAP therefore recommends that childrens hospital GME positions funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration be increased to address this escalating demand for pediatric health services. The AAP also recommends that GME funding for pediatric physician training provide full financial support for all years of training necessary to meet program requirements. In addition all other entities that gain from GME training should participate in its funding in a manner that does not influence curriculum requirements or outcomes. Furthermore the AAP supports funding for training innovations that improve the health of children. Finally the AAP recommends that all institutional recipients of GME funding allocate these funds directly to the settings where training occurs in a transparent manner.",

    "abstract": "The genus Vitivirus in the family Betaflexiviridae includes eleven viruses known to infect grapevine grapevine vitiviruses A B D E F G H I J L and M GVA-GVM. Three of these viruses GVA GVB and GVD have been associated with the etiology of rugose wood disease in grapevine and cause agronomically significant losses. The other vitiviruses were more recently discovered and their effects on grapevine are undetermined. To certify grape material for propagation as virus tested an updated reverse transcription PCR RT-PCR assay to detect all known vitiviruses is desirable. To accomplish this multiple grapevine vitivirus sequences were aligned at the amino acid level to search for conserved motifs. Two highly conserved motifs were found at an ideal distance for RT-PCR detection in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region of the replicase protein. The amino acid motifs were back translated to create degenerate primers and used to successfully amplify all eleven grapevine vitiviruses. The RT-PCR primers were used to test a panel of vitivirus-infected vines for inclusivity as well as vines infected with closely related viruses in the Betaflexiviridae family i.e. grapevine pinot gris virus and grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus for exclusivity. Broader use of these primers to detect vitiviruses in other plant hosts was investigated. In summary an end-point RT-PCR assay that detects all the known grapevine vitiviruses and potentially other members of the genus Vitivirus has been developed. The universal assay represents an alternative to individual assays to reduce the work associated with the diagnosis of vitiviruses including for regulatory purposes.",

Flesh gills and innerwater were examined for Cryptosporidium oocyst detection using immunomagnetic separation and immunofluorescence assay. Oocysts were present in all samples for all sites and seasons and flesh was the most contaminated part. Oocyst rates were apparently related with seasonal rain precipitation variations. Molecular analysis revealed that oocysts belonged to the species Cryptosporidium parvum formerly genotype 2 or bovine genotype. Oocyst infectivity was assessed by oral administration to suckling NMRI-mice and developmental stages were observed in only one mouse infected with oocysts from one location. The detection of potentially infectious C. parvum oocysts of likely cattle-breeding origin in cultured edible mussels confirms their resistance to sea environments and underlines the potential risk of food-borne infection. This work reports for the first time the presence of infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts in shellfish from France.",

Data for this study was collected from 434 individuals consecutively evaluated at a university-based Alzheimers Center. A total of 96 participants were diagnosed with MCI 105 were cognitively normal and 233 had dementia. Informant ratings of participants abilities were obtained across different functional domains reflecting everyday abilities related to memory language visual spatial abilities planning organization and divided attention. As expected the demented group was significantly more impaired than the healthy control and MCI groups across all of the functional domains. The MCI group also showed significantly more functional impairment relative to healthy controls in all of the functional domains. Examination of the effect sizes as a measure of the magnitude of functional impairment in the MCI groups relative to controls showed that the greatest degree of impairment occurred within the Everyday Memory domain. The current findings suggest that individuals with MCI demonstrate deficits in a wide range of everyday functions but that the magnitude of these changes is greatest for those functional abilities that rely heavily on memory.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate whether intramuscular vaccination of healthy adult horses with a killed or a modified live equine herpesvirus type 1 EHV-1 vaccine could induce transient positive PCR results in either blood or secretions collected on a nasopharyngeal swab. Four horses in each group received either a single killed or a modified-live vaccine intramuscularly. Two local commingled and 2 distant nonvaccinated controls were included for each group. All horses were observed daily for evidence of clinical abnormalities throughout the study periods. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected twice before vaccination and once weekly for 4 weeks after vaccination and submitted for PCR testing for EHV-1 by 2 independent laboratories using different real-time PCR methodologies. Serum samples collected from all horses on the vaccination day and 21 days later were tested for antibodies against EHV-1 using a serum neutralization test. Whereas the 2 vaccine strains tested positive in both EHV-1 PCR assays nasopharyngeal swabs and whole blood collected from vaccinated and control horses had negative PCR test results for EHV-1 during the entire study period. Serum neutralization testing revealed a 2- to 4-fold increase in titers for all vaccinated horses whereas titers in control horses were largely unchanged. The use of seropositive horses before immunization and the sampling frequency of 7 days may have prevented the occasional molecular detection of the vaccine virus in whole blood and nasopharyngeal secretions. However the study results demonstrate that detection of EHV-1 DNA by PCR in vaccinated and unvaccinated healthy horses is not a common event.",

We argue that political screening is a persistent feature and a survival strategy of all Communist parties and that the mechanisms of ensuring political screening are affected by the regimes agendas in different historical periods. Using data from surveys conducted in Shanghai and Tianjin in 1993 we found that measures of political screening were persistently significant predictors of party membership attainment in all post-1949 periods and that party membership is positively associated with mobility into positions of political and managerial authority during the post-1978 reform era. Education emerged to be a significant predictor of Communist party membership in the post-1978 period. These findings indicate that China has made historical shifts to recruit among the educated to create a technocratic elite that is both occupationally competent and politically screened. 2001 University of North Carolina Press.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Efforts to develop global programs for the control of iron deficiency require simple low-cost and accurate indicators of iron status. OBJECTIVE We aimed to compare estimates of body iron BI stores as calculated from either plasma ferritin concentration alone BI-ferritin or the ratio of plasma transferrin receptor TfR to ferritin BI-TfRferritin. DESIGN Data were analyzed from 4 previously completed randomized intervention trials that enrolled infants schoolchildren or pregnant women total n 1189 after excluding subjects with elevated C-reactive protein. RESULTS The correlation coefficients between BI-ferritin and BI-TfRferritin were 0.95 for all studies. The kappa index ranged from 0.5 to 1.0. All of the sensitivities of BI-ferritin for identifying persons with low iron stores defined as BI-TfRferritin 0 mgkg body wt were 0.90. All of the specificities were 0.90 except the study of pregnant women specificity 0.66. The effect sizes of iron intervention trials were significantly greater for change in iron reserves estimated by BI-TfRferritin than by BI-ferritin in 2 studies with larger effect sizes 1.11 compared with 1.00 and 1.56 compared with 1.44 respectively P 0.05 and 1 study with medium effect size 0.70 compared with 0.57 P 0.05. However there were no significant differences between estimates of these effect sizes for 1 study with a medium effect size and 1 study with a smaller effect size 0.78 compared with 0.83 and 0.37 compared with 0.35 respectively P 0.2. CONCLUSION Plasma ferritin concentration alone provides a good approximation of total BI reserves as estimated by BI-TfRferritin on the basis of high correlation sensitivity and specificity among nonpregnant persons with unelevated C-reactive protein.",

As part of addressing these gaps the Breastmilk Ecology Genesis of Infant Nutrition BEGIN Project Working Groups 1-4 interrogated the state of knowledge regarding the infant-human milk-lactating parent triad. However to optimize the impact of newly generated knowledge across all stages of human milk research the need remained for a translational research framework specific to the field. Thus with inspiration from the simplified environmental sciences framework of Kaufman and Curl Working Group 5 of the BEGIN Project developed a translational framework for science in human lactation and infant feeding which includes 5 nonlinear interconnected translational stages T1 Discovery T2 Human health implications T3 Clinical and public health implications T4 Implementation and T5 Impact. The framework is accompanied by 6 overarching principles 1 Research spans the translational continuum in a nonlinear nonhierarchical manner 2 Projects engage interdisciplinary teams in continuous collaboration and cross talk 3 Priorities and study designs incorporate a diverse range of contextual factors 4 Research teams include community stakeholders from the outset through purposeful ethical and equitable engagement 5 Research designs and conceptual models incorporate respectful care for the birthing parent and address implications for the lactating parent 6 Research implications for real-world settings account for contextual factors surrounding the feeding of human milk including exclusivity and mode of feeding. To demonstrate application of the presented translational research framework and its overarching principles 6 case studies are included each illustrating research gaps across all stages of the framework. Applying a translational framework approach to addressing gaps in the science of human milk feeding is an important step toward the aligned goals of optimizing infant feeding across diverse contexts as well as optimizing health for all.",

    "abstract": "Fenretinide is significantly more effective in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells than all-trans retinoic acid ATRA. The current study uses a genome-wide approach to understand the differential role fenretinide and ATRA have in inducing apoptosis in Huh7 cells. Fenretinide and ATRA-induced gene expressions and DNA bindings were profiled using microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-RXR antibody. The data showed that fenretinide was not a strong transcription regulator. Fenretinide only changed the expressions of 1 093 genes approximately three times less than the number of genes regulated by ATRA 2 811. Biological function annotation demonstrated that both fenretinide and ATRA participated in pathways that determine cell fate and metabolic processes. However fenretinide specifically induced FasTNF-mediated apoptosis by increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic genes i.e. DEDD2 CASP8 CASP4 and HSPA1AB whereas ATRA induced the expression of BIRC3 and TNFAIP3 which inhibit apoptosis by interacting with TRAF2. In addition fenretinide inhibited the expression of the genes involved in RASRAFERK-mediated survival pathway. In contrast ATRA increased the expression of SOSC2 BRAF MEK and ERK genes. Most genes regulated by fenretinide and ATRA were bound by RXR suggesting a direct effect. This study revealed that by regulating fewer genes the effects of fenretinide become more specific and thus has fewer side effects than ATRA. The data also suggested that fenretinide induces apoptosis via death receptor effector and by inhibiting the RASRAFERK pathway. It provides insight on how retinoid efficacy can be improved and how side effects in cancer therapy can be reduced.",

    "abstract": "Assessing heavy metal pollution in river sediments and identifying the key factors contributing to metal pollution are critical components for devising river environmental protection and remediation strategies to protect human and ecological health. This is especially important in urban areas where metals from a wide range of sources contribute to sediment pollution. In this study the metal enrichment factor EF was used to measure the watershed distribution of Cu Zn Pb and Cd in sediments in the Wen-Rui Tang urban river system in Wenzhou Eastern China. The Geographical Detector Method GDM was specifically evaluated for its ability to analyze spatial relationships between metal EFs and their anthropogenic and natural control factors including densities of industry DI livestock DL service industries DS population DP and roads DR along with agricultural area AG sediment total organic carbon TOC and soil types ST. Results showed that the watershed was highly contaminated by all metals with an EF trend of Cd Zn Cu Pb. The spatial distribution of EFs demonstrated high contamination of all metals in the southwestern region of the watershed where industrial activities were concentrated and higher Cu and Zn concentrations in the northeastern region having a high density of livestock production. GDM results identified DI as the dominant determinant for all metals while TOC and ST were determined to have a moderate secondary influence for Zn Pb and Cd. Additionally GDM revealed several additive and nonlinear interactions between anthropogenic and natural factors influencing metal concentrations. Compared to other correlation multiple linear regression and geographically weighted regression GDM demonstrated distinct advantages of being able to assess both categorical and continuous variables and determine both single and multiple factor interactions. These attributes provide a more comprehensive understanding of metal spatial distributions while avoiding multicollinearity issues when identifying significant contributing factors at the watershed scale.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Various methods have been described to create a functional neovagina with feminizing male-to-female gender affirming surgery. Intestinal vaginoplasty using ileal or colon segments confers natural mucus production and greater canal depth with primary vaginoplasty. In this work we describe an alternative approach to primary and salvage vaginoplasty using right colon. We focus on relative advantages compared to use of other bowel segments and we review patient outcomes. METHODS Transgender women who had previously undergone primary vaginoplasty underwent laparoscopic right colon vaginoplasty at our center between 122017 and 72019. Demographic medical outcome and satisfaction data was collected and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-two consecutive transgender women patients underwent laparoscopic right colon vaginoplasty. Mean age was 39.3 years. There were two intraoperative complications1 injury of the ileocolic pedicle and 1 minor bladder injury. Four of 22 patients 18.2 had short-term complications 30 days 3 had postoperative ileussmall bowel obstruction and 1 had intra-abdominal hemorrhage. All were managed conservatively. Six of 22 patients 27.3 experienced a total of 14 long-term complications 30 days 1 developed Crohns not involving the neovagina 1 developed late small bowel obstruction SBO managed conservatively 5 developed neovagina prolapse 4 developed stenosis 2 at the vaginal introitus and 2 had extrinsic obstruction at the recto-vaginal junction all underwent successful laparoscopic surgical correction and 3 were diagnosed with diversion neovaginitis all treated conservatively. All complications were successfully treated with conservative andor surgical intervention. All 100 patients reported satisfaction with neovagina function and appearance. CONCLUSION This is the only outcomes series of transgender women patients who have undergone right colon vaginoplasty to date. Our study finding suggests that laparoscopic right colon for primary or salvage vaginoplasty has several important advantages over use of Sigmoid colon or Ileum and is a reliable technique whose complications can be managed successfully with favorable satisfactory long-term outcomes.",

This allows for the use of oligonucleotides containing only natural 3-5 phosphodiester linkages to simultaneously bind both strands of double helical DNA in the major groove. The stabilities and structures of these alternate strand triple helices depend on whether the binding site sequence is 5-purinempyrimidinen-3 or 5-pyrimidinempurinen-3. The sequence type 5-purinem- pyrimidinen-3 was targeted with an oligonucleotide consisting of a pyrimidine domain and a purine domain linked by a 3-5 phosphodiester. To bind the duplex sequence type 5-pyrimidinempurinen-3 the third strand requires at least two nucleotides linking binding domains at the site of crossover in the major groove. A new class of oligonucleotides capable of binding mixed duplex sequences by crossovers in the major groove may be possible. 1992 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.",

The major metabolites under these conditions of all the epoxy fatty esters were their vicinal diols whose structures were confirmed by GC-MS. 1213-Epoxymethyloleate was metabolized faster than 910-epoxymethyloleate and other epoxy fatty esters but all substrates were turned over rapidly.

To begin to characterize the important agronomic and ecological traits related to environmental tolerance of switchgrass we evaluated fitness under stressful growing conditions. We assessed the germination establishment performance and reproductive potential of four common accessions both upland and lowland ecotypes at various levels of soil moisture availability moisture deficit to flooded in the greenhouse. Seeds emerged and established 55-90 survival under all soil moisture conditions -0.3 MPa to flooded. Transplants of lowland ecotypes performed as well in flooded conditions as in field capacity controls though flooding reduced performance of upland ecotypes. Drought treatments -4.0 and -11.0 MPa reduced tiller length and number leaf area and biomass production by up to 80. However once established all plants survived at -4.0 MPa and had the same proportion of tillers in flower as at field capacity. The ability of switchgrass to germinate establish and flower in low moisture and flooded conditions particularly lowland ecotypes may increase the range of environments suitable for biofuel cultivation and can serve as a baseline for further ecological studies and genetic improvement. 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

    "abstract": "Resting-state rs functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI is used to detect low-frequency fluctuations in the blood oxygen-level dependent BOLD signal across brain regions. Correlations between temporal BOLD signal fluctuations are commonly used to infer functional connectivity. However because BOLD is based on the dilution of deoxyhemoglobin it is sensitive to veins of all sizes and its amplitude is biased by draining veins. These biases affect local BOLD signal location and amplitude and may also influence BOLD-derived connectivity measures but the magnitude of this venous bias and its relation to vein size and proximity is unknown. Here veins were identified using high-resolution quantitative susceptibility maps and utilized in a biophysical model to investigate systematic venous biases on common local rsfMRI-derived measures. Specifically we studied the impact of vein diameter and distance to veins on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ALFF fractional ALFF fALFF Hurst exponent HE regional homogeneity ReHo and eigenvector centrality values in the grey matter. Values were higher across all distances in smaller veins and decreased with increasing vein diameter. Additionally rsfMRI values associated with larger veins decrease with increasing distance from the veins. ALFF and ReHo were the most biased by veins while HE and fALFF exhibited the smallest bias. Across all metrics the amplitude of the bias was limited in voxel-wise data confirming that venous structure is not the dominant source of contrast in these rsfMRI metrics. Finally the models presented can be used to correct this venous bias in rsfMRI metrics.",

    "abstract": "Reaching the native states of small proteins a necessary step towards a comprehensive understanding of the folding mechanisms has remained a tremendous challenge to ab initio protein folding simulations despite the extensive effort. In this work the folding process of the B domain of protein A BdpA has been simulated by both conventional and replica exchange molecular dynamics using AMBER FF03 all-atom force field. Started from an extended chain a total of 40 conventional each to 1.0 micros and two sets of replica exchange each to 200.0 ns per replica molecular dynamics simulations were performed with different generalized-Born solvation models and temperature control schemes. The improvements in both the force field and solvent model allowed successful simulations of the folding process to the native state as demonstrated by the 0.80 A Calpha root mean square deviation RMSD of the best folded structure. The most populated conformation was the native folded structure with a high population. This was a significant improvement over the 2.8 A Calpha RMSD of the best nativelike structures from previous ab initio folding studies on BdpA. To the best of our knowledge our results demonstrate for the first time that ab initio simulations can reach the native state of BdpA. Consistent with experimental observations including Phi-value analyses formation of helix IIIII hairpin was a crucial step that provides a template upon which helix I could form and the folding process could complete. Early formation of helix III was observed which is consistent with the experimental results of higher residual helical content of isolated helix III among the three helices. The calculated temperature-dependent profile and the melting temperature were in close agreement with the experimental results. The simulations further revealed that phenylalanine 31 may play critical to achieve the correct packing of the three helices which is consistent with the experimental observation. In addition to the mechanistic studies an ab initio structure prediction was also conducted based on both the physical energy and a statistical potential. Based on the lowest physical energy the predicted structure was 2.0 A Calpha RMSD away from the experimentally determined structure.",

All serum albumin concentrations were outside of reference intervals and the majority of serum glucose calcium phosphorus potassium CK GGT and total bilirubin were outside of reference intervals. More serum chemistry measures diverged from reference intervals in the first 24 h of neonatal life. Rectal temperature decreased P 0.003 from 0 to 6 h of age then increased P 0.02 from 12 to 48 h. In summary blood chemistry profiles of healthy suckling neonatal beef calves change over the first 72 h of life indicating rapid changes in metabolism and physiology.

Critically thematic relationships are learned from the experienced co-occurrence of objects whereas taxonomic relationships are based on shared structural similarities. In two studies with adults N 66 Experiment 1 N 44 Experiment 2 we test whether visual processing of thematic objects is more rapid because they form a perceptual unit and serve as mutual visual primes.

In these models the required pattern of small neutrino masses and Nambu-Goldstone-boson couplings are understood as the low-energy residue of the pattern of breaking of lepton-number symmetries near the electroweak scale and all mass hierarchies are technically natural. The models are compatible with all cosmological and astrophysical constraints and can solve the solar-neutrino problem either via the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect or vacuum oscillations. The deficit in atmospheric muon neutrinos seen in the Kamiokande and IMB detectors can also be explained in these models. 1992 The American Physical Society.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to characterize the engine start activity profiles and emission potential of various plug-in hybrid electric vehicle PHEV models by examining the characteristics associated with engine starts identifying the travel conditions that trigger engine starts and determining the frequency of different types of engine starts. The study analyzed on-road vehicle data from six PHEV models Toyota Prius Plug-in Ford C-Max Energi Ford C-Max Fusion Toyota Prius Prime Chrysler Pacifica and Chevrolet Volt. An analysis on travel conditions before engine starts revealed that low state-of-charge is the dominant engine start trigger for PHEVs with high all-electric range whereas high vehicle power requirement is the most critical trigger for PHEVs with low all-electric range. For PHEVs with mid-range capabilities several vehicle specifications ranging from peak electric motor power to curb weight could be engine start determinants. A strong inverse correlation exists between battery capacity and the annual frequency of engine starts but this relationship does not hold for cold and high-power cold starts. Both the low and the high battery capacity PHEVs logged fewer cold starts than the mid-sized battery vehicles indicating that there could be a fundamental tradeoff between engine start emissions and fuel displacement for PHEVs to a certain degree. Despite this tradeoff all PHEV models in the study logged fewer cold starts than comparable conventional internal combustion engine vehicles performing the same trips. Ultimately long-range PHEVs with high battery capacity are found to be ideal for both curbing start emissions and reducing fuel use.",

Between 2012 and 2017 we mapped four stripe rust resistance quantitative trait loci QTL effective against the Pst races present in California USA using recombinant inbred lines RILs developed from the cross between the Argentinean cultivars Klein Proteo and Klein Chaj. The RIL population showed transgressive segregation in all six growing seasons relative to the parental lines which showed moderate levels of Pst resistance. Analyses by year detected QTL conferring adult plant resistance on chromosomes 1BL 2BS 3D centromeric from Klein Chaj and 4DL from Klein Proteo. QYr.ucw-1BL mapped in the Yr29 resistance gene region was significant in all seasons P 0.01 and explained on average 31.0 to 32.8 of the observed variation. QYr.ucw-2BS showed a stronger effect than QYr.ucw-1BL in 2013 but was ineffective in 2014 and 2016. This QTL also conferred seedling resistance suggesting that it is an all-stage resistance gene. Centromeric QYr.ucw-3D and QYr.ucw-4DL showed smaller effects than the previous QTL and were significant only in some of the experiments. No significant interactions were detected among QTL indicating the absence of digenic epistatic effects. The molecular markers identified in this study can be used to combine these genes and accelerate their deployment in wheat breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Reducing the Internet power consumption will become a challenging issue since the Internet is expected to face a high growth in terms of traffic requirements. Simply scaling the network architecture thus increasing its energy consumption proportionally to this growth would not be a practical solution. Various energy-efficient approaches have been considered typically consisting in a dual-layer network architecture through the introduction of an all-optical transport network layer as relevant power savings can be reached thanks to optical technologies. Optical switching especially allows to significantly reduce the quantity of high power-requiring opticalelectronic optical conversions and electronic processing operations. A further improvement can be obtained with Time Driven Switching TDS a technique which allows to switch fractions of wavelengths directly in the optical domain exploiting the time-coordination of all network components. In this paper we show the benefits in terms of power saving provided by the TDS transport architecture by performing a comprehensive overview of the different core network architectures and comparing the power consumption obtained in the different cases. With such an optical transport technology power savings of more than 40 are demonstrated with respect to existing architectures. 2011 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "The study of the mammalian microbiome serves as a critical tool for understanding host-microbial diversity and coevolution and the impact of bacterial communities on host health. While studies of specific microbial systems e.g. in the human gut have rapidly increased large knowledge gaps remain hindering our understanding of the determinants and levels of variation in microbiomes across multiple body sites and host species. Here we compare microbiome community compositions from eight distinct body sites among 17 phylogenetically diverse species of nonhuman primates NHPs representing the largest comparative study of microbial diversity across primate host species and body sites. Analysis of 898 samples predominantly acquired in the wild demonstrated that oral microbiomes were unique in their clustering with distinctive divergence from all other body site microbiomes. In contrast all other body site microbiomes clustered principally by host species and differentiated by body site within host species. These results highlight two key findings i the oral microbiome is unique compared to all other body site microbiomes and conserved among diverse nonhuman primates despite their considerable dietary and phylogenetic differences and ii assessments of the determinants of host-microbial diversity are relative to the level of the comparison i.e. intra-inter-body site -host species and -individual emphasizing the need for broader comparative microbial analyses across diverse hosts to further elucidate host-microbial dynamics evolutionary and biological patterns of variation and implications for human-microbial coevolution. IMPORTANCE The microbiome is critical to host health and disease but much remains unknown about the determinants levels and evolution of host-microbial diversity. The relationship between hosts and their associated microbes is complex. Most studies to date have focused on the gut microbiome however large gaps remain in our understanding of host-microbial diversity coevolution and levels of variation in microbiomes across multiple body sites and host species. To better understand the patterns of variation and evolutionary context of host-microbial communities we conducted one of the largest comparative studies to date which indicated that the oral microbiome was distinct from the microbiomes of all other body sites and convergent across host species suggesting conserved niche specialization within the Primates order. We also show the importance of host species differences in shaping the microbiome within specific body sites. This large comparative study contributes valuable information on key patterns of variation among hosts and body sites with implications for understanding host-microbial dynamics and human-microbial coevolution.",

We used newly available population-based data to examine whether the age-specific incidences of breast cancer subtypes vary by race and ethnicity. METHODS We classified 91908 invasive breast cancers diagnosed in California between January 1 2006 and December 31 2009 by subtype based on tumor expression of estrogen receptor ER and progesterone receptor PR-together referred to as hormone receptor HR-and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2. Breast cancer subtypes were classified as ER or PR positive and HER2 negative HRHER2- ER or PR positive and HER2 positive HRHER2 ER and PR negative and HER2 positive HR-HER2 and ER PR and HER2 negative triple-negative. We calculated and compared age-specific incidence rates incidence rate ratios and 95 confidence intervals by subtype and race black white Hispanic and Asian. All P values are two-sided. RESULTS We did not observe an age-related black-white crossover in incidence for any molecular subtype of breast cancer. Compared with white women black women had statistically significantly higher rates of triple-negative breast cancer at all ages but statistically significantly lower rates of HRHER2- breast cancers after age 35 years all P .05. The age-specific incidence of HRHER2 and HR-HER2 subtypes did not vary markedly between white and black women. CONCLUSIONS The black-white crossover in breast cancer incidence occurs only when all breast cancer subtypes are combined and relates largely to higher rates of triple-negative breast cancers and lower rates of HRHER2- breast cancers in black vs white women.",

    "abstract": "All-trans retinoic acid RA is a potent inducer of regeneration. Because the liver is the principal site for storage and bioactivation of vitamin A the current study examines the effect of RA in mouse hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. Mice that received a single dose of RA 25gg by oral gavage developed hepatomegaly with increased number of Ki67-positive cells and induced expression of cell cycle genes in the liver. DNA binding data revealed that RA receptors retinoic acid receptor RAR and retinoid x receptor RXR bound to cell cycle genes Cdk1 Cdk2 Cyclin B Cyclin E and Cdc25a in mice with and without RA treatment. In addition RA treatment induced novel binding of RARRXR to Cdk1 Cdk2 Cyclin D and Cdk6 genes. All RARRXR binding sites contained AGGTCA-like motifs. RA treatment also promoted liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy PH. RA signaling was implicated in normal liver regeneration as the mRNA levels of RAR Aldh1a2 Crabp1 and Crbp1 were all induced 1.5 days after PH during the active phase of hepatocyte proliferation. RA treatment prior to PH resulted in early up-regulation of RAR Aldh1a2 Crabp1 and Crbp1 which was accompanied by an early induction of cell cycle genes. Western blotting for RAR c-myc Cyclin D E and A further supported the early induction of retinoid signal and cell proliferation by RA treatment. Taken together our data suggest that RA may regulate cell cycle progression and accelerates liver regeneration. Such effect is associated with an early induction of RA signaling which includes increased expression of the receptor binding proteins and processing enzyme for retinoids.",

Published data suggest that cancer treatment at a specialized cancer center SCC can improve survival in other cancers. Therefore we examined the impact of the location of treatment on survival in children and adolescents and young adults AYAs with STS. Methods We performed a population-based analysis of children and AYAs hospitalized within 1 year of diagnosis with first primary STS 2000-2014 using the California Cancer Registry linked with hospitalization data. Patients were categorized based on receiving all inpatient treatments at a SCC versus partnone. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors associated with overall and STS-specific survival by age group. Results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios HRs and 95 confidence intervals CIs. Results Of the 1674 patients with STS 142 were children 0-14 and 1532 were AYAs 15-39 and 89.4 and 40.4 received all inpatient treatments at a SCC respectively. Overall the 5-year survival was improved for patients who received all inpatient care at a SCC 59.8 vs. those who received partnone 50.7. Multivariable regression analysis found that having all treatments at a SCC was associated with better overall survival HR 0.79 CI 0.65-0.95 in AYAs but not in children. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that treatment for STS at a SCC is associated with better survival in AYAs. Eliminating barriers to treatment of AYAs with STS at SCCs could improve survival in this population.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND As familiarity with military massive transfusion MT triggers has increased there is a growing interest in applying these in the civilian population to initiate MT protocols MTP earlier. We hypothesize that these triggers do not have equal predictability for MT and understanding the contribution of each would improve our ability to initiate the MTP earlier. METHODS All patients presenting to a Level I trauma center from October 2007 to September 2008 requiring immediate operation were included in this study. Emergency department records operative logs and blood transfusion data from arrival to procedure end were analyzed using multivariate regression techniques. Triggers included systolic blood pressure SBP 90 mm Hg hemoglobin 11 gdL temperature 35.5C International normalized ratio INR 1.5 and base deficit 6. RESULTS One hundred seventy patients required immediate operation with an overall survival of 91. Transfusion of packed red blood cells was noted in 45 77 of 170 with the mean number of transfused units highest in those meeting SBP 12.9 Units or INR 12.3 Units triggers. The triggers do not contribute equal predictive value for the need for transfusion with INR being the most predictive odds ratio 16.7 95 confidence interval 2-137 for any transfusion and highly predictive for the need for MT odds ratio 11.3 95 confidence interval 3-47. In fact if patients met either INR or SBP triggers alone they were likely to receive MT p 0.018 and 0.003 respectively. CONCLUSION Triggers have differential predictive values for need for transfusion. Defining the individual utility of each criterion will help to identify those most likely to benefit from an early initiation of the MTP.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Depression may be associated with increased mortality risk but there are substantial limitations to existing studies assessing this relationship. We sought to overcome limitations of existing studies by conducting a large national longitudinal study to assess the impact of depression on all-cause and cause-specific risk of death. METHODS We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios associated with baseline depression diagnosis N849474 and three-year mortality among 5078082 patients treated in Veterans Health Administration VHA settings in fiscal year FY 2006. Cause of death was obtained from the National Death Index NDI. RESULTS Baseline depression was associated with 17 greater hazard of all-cause three-year mortality 95 CI hazard ratio HR 1.15 1.18 after adjusting for baseline patient demographic and clinical characteristics and VHA facility characteristics. Depression was associated with a higher hazard of three-year mortality from heart disease respiratory illness cerebrovascular disease accidents diabetes nephritis influenza Alzheimers disease septicemia suicide Parkinsons disease and hypertension. Depression was associated with a lower hazard of death from malignant neoplasm and liver disease. Depression was not associated with mortality due to assault. CONCLUSIONS In addition to being associated with suicide and injury-related causes of death depression is associated with increased risk of death from nearly all major medical causes independent of multiple major risk factors. Findings highlight the need to better understand and prevent mortality seen with multiple medical disorders associated with depression.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE A recent Food and Drug Administration FDA warning cautioned that citalopram dosages exceeding 40 mgday may cause abnormal heart rhythms including torsade de pointes. The authors assessed relationships between citalopram use and ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. METHOD A cohort study was conducted using Veterans Health Administration data between 2004 and 2009 from depressed patients who received a prescription for citalopram N618450 or for sertraline N365898 a comparison medication with no FDA warning. Cox regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics were used to examine associations of antidepressant dosing with ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac noncardiac and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Citalopram daily doses 40 mg were associated with lower risks of ventricular arrhythmia adjusted hazard ratio0.68 95 CI0.61-0.76 all-cause mortality adjusted hazard ratio0.94 95 CI0.90-0.99 and noncardiac mortality adjusted hazard ratio0.90 95 CI0.86-0.96 compared with daily doses of 1-20 mg. No increased risks of cardiac mortality were found. Citalopram daily doses of 21-40 mg were associated with lower risks of ventricular arrhythmia adjusted hazard ratio0.80 95 CI0.74-0.86 compared with dosages of 1-20 mgday but did not have significantly different risks of any cause of mortality. The sertraline cohort revealed similar findings except there were no significant associations between daily dose and either all-cause or noncardiac mortality. CONCLUSIONS This large study found no elevated risks of ventricular arrhythmia or all-cause cardiac or noncardiac mortality associated with citalopram dosages 40 mgday. Higher dosages were associated with fewer adverse outcomes and similar findings were observed for a comparison medication sertraline not subject to the FDA warning. These results raise questions regarding the continued merit of the FDA warning.",

Currently there are no unbiased estimates of the number of full-mutation FMR1 alleles in the general population a major obstacle is the lack of an effective screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles in large populations. We have developed a rapid polymerase chain reaction PCR-based screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles. The method utilizes a chimeric PCR primer that targets randomly within the expanded CGG region such that the presence of a broad distribution of PCR products represents a positive result for an expanded allele. The method is applicable for screening both males and females and for allele sizes throughout the premutation 55 to 200 CGG repeats and full-mutation ranges. Furthermore the method is capable of rapid detection of expanded alleles using as little as 1 of the DNA from a single dried blood spot. The methodology presented in this work is suitable for screening large populations of newborn or those at high risk eg autism premature ovarian failure ataxia dementia for expanded FMR1 alleles. The test described herein costs less than 5 per sample for materials with suitable scale-up and automation the cost should approach 1 per sample.",

    "abstract": "The development of imitation during the second year of life plays an important role in domains of sociocognitive development such as language and social learning. Deficits in imitation ability in persons with autism spectrum disorder ASD from toddlerhood into adulthood have also been repeatedly documented raising the possibility that early disruptions in imitation contribute to the onset of ASD and the deficits in language and social interaction that define the disorder. This study prospectively examined the development of imitation between 12 and 24 months of age in 154 infants at familial risk for ASD and 78 typically developing infants who were all later assessed at 36 months for ASD or other developmental delays. The study established a developmental measure of imitation ability and examined group differences over time using an analytic Rasch measurement model. Results revealed a unidimensional latent construct of imitation and verified a reliable sequence of imitation skills that was invariant over time for all outcome groups. Results also showed that all groups displayed similar significant linear increases in imitation ability between 12 and 24 months and that these increases were related to individual growth in both expressive language and ratings of social engagement but not in fine motor development. The group of children who developed ASD by age 3 years exhibited delayed imitation development compared with the low-risk typical outcome group across all time-points but were indistinguishable from other high-risk infants who showed other cognitive delays not related to ASD.",

    "abstract": "Among many molecules known to influence wound healing transforming growth factor beta 1 TGF beta 1 has the broadest spectrum of actions affecting all cell types that are involved in all stages of wound healing. Both positive and negative effects of TGF beta 1 on wound healing have been reported. However the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We observed that endogenous TGF beta 1 was elevated in a narrow window of time after injury and transgenic mice constitutively overexpressing wild-type TGF beta 1 in keratinocytes K5.TGF beta 1wt exhibited a significant delay in full-thickness wound healing as compared to non-transgenic mice. Delayed wound healing was associated with profound inflammation throughout all stages of wound healing in K5.TGF beta 1wt mice. Our data suggest that excessive and prolonged TGF beta 1 at the wound site does not benefit wound healing which is partially owing to its pro-inflammatory effect. Future studies need to be conducted to assess whether tightly regulated TGF beta 1 expression will benefit wound healing. To this end we have developed a gene-switch TGF beta 1 transgenic system that allows TGF beta 1 induction in keratinocytes temporally with desired levels. These mice will provide a tool to study stage-specific effects of TGF beta 1 on cutaneous wound healing.",

In order to investigate the distribution of lesions associated with aging as well as with the earliest symptoms of Alzheimers disease we performed a quantitative neuropathological evaluation of sixty-one non-demented patients from a geriatric hospital. All of the cases had neurofibrillary tangles in layer II of the entorhinal cortex and many cases had an involvement of the CA1 field of the hippocampus and the inferior temporal cortex. In all of the cases amyloid deposition was not correlated with age or with the number of neurofibrillary tangles. In addition eight cases showed much higher neurofibrillary tangle counts than the remainder of the cases. It is proposed that these cases may represent the neuropathological correlate of the earliest stage of Alzheimers disease that could antedate the appearance of clinical signs of cognitive decline and memory impairment.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To describe longitudinal multimodal imaging findings of nonexudative choroidal neovascularization in CTRP5 late-onset retinal degeneration. METHODS Four patients with CTRP5-positive late-onset retinal degeneration underwent repeated ophthalmoscopic examination and multimodal imaging. All four patients two siblings and their cousins from a pedigree described previously had the heterozygous S163R mutation. RESULTS All four patients demonstrated large subretinal lesions in the mid-peripheral retina of both eyes. The lesions were characterized by confluent hypercyanescence with hypocyanescent borders on indocyanine green angiography faintly visible branching vascular networks with absentminimal leakage on fluorescein angiography Type 1 neovascularization on optical coherence tomography angiography and absent retinal fluid consistent with nonexudative choroidal neovascularization. The neovascular membranes enlarged substantially over time and the birth of new membranes was observed but all lesions remained nonexudativeminimally exudative. Without treatment all involved retinal areas remained free of atrophy and subretinal fibrosis. CONCLUSION We report the existence of massive advancing nonexudative Type 1 choroidal neovascularization in CTRP5 late-onset retinal degeneration. These findings have implications for age-related macular degeneration. They provide a monogenic model system for studying the mechanisms underlying the distinct events of choroidal neovascularization development enlargement progression to exudation and atrophy in age-related macular degeneration. They suggest that choroidal hypoperfusion precedes neovascularization and that nonexudative neovascularization may protect against atrophy.",

However with no AYA cancer medical specialty information on where and by whom AYAs with cancer are treated is limited. METHODS Using the National Cancer Institutes population-based AYA HOPE Study 464 AYAs aged 15-39 at diagnosis treated by 903 physicians were identified. Differences in physician and hospital characteristics were examined by age at diagnosis and cancer type germ cell cancer non-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and sarcoma using chi-square tests. RESULTS Treating physicians were predominately 51-64 years old male United States-trained in non-pediatric specialties and in group practices within large metropolitan areas. Older patients were less often treated by pediatric physicians p 0.01 and more likely to be treated by United States-trained physicians without researchteaching responsibilities and in hospitals without residency programs p 0.05. The majority of the few pediatricians n 44 treated ALL patients.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Rapidly characterizing the operational interrelationships among all genes in a given organism is a critical bottleneck to significantly advancing our understanding of thousands of newly sequenced microbial and eukaryotic species. While evolving technologies for global profiling of transcripts proteins and metabolites are making it possible to comprehensively survey cellular physiology in newly sequenced organisms these experimental techniques have not kept pace with sequencing efforts. Compounding these technological challenges is the fact that individual experiments typically only stimulate relatively small-scale cellular responses thus requiring numerous expensive experiments to survey the operational relationships among nearly all genetic elements. Therefore a relatively quick and inexpensive strategy for observing changes in large fractions of the genetic elements is highly desirable. RESULTS We have discovered in the model organism Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 that batch culturing in complex medium stimulates meaningful changes in the expression of approximately two thirds of all genes. While the majority of these changes occur during transition from rapid exponential growth to the stationary phase several transient physiological states were detected beyond what has been previously observed. In sum integrated analysis of transcript and metabolite changes has helped uncover growth phase-associated physiologies operational interrelationships among two thirds of all genes specialized functions for gene family members waves of transcription factor activities and growth phase associated cell morphology control. CONCLUSIONS Simple laboratory culturing in complex medium can be enormously informative regarding the activities of and interrelationships among a large fraction of all genes in an organism. This also yields important baseline physiological context for designing specific perturbation experiments at different phases of growth. The integration of such growth and perturbation studies with measurements of associated environmental factor changes is a practical and economical route for the elucidation of comprehensive systems-level models of biological systems.",

OBJECTIVE The objective was to evaluate the effects of antiretroviral therapy andor lipid-based nutrient supplements LNSs on B vitamin concentrations in breast milk from HIV-infected women in Malawi. DESIGN Breast milk was collected from 537 women recruited within the Breastfeeding Antiretrovirals and Nutrition study at 2 or 6 wk and 24 wk postpartum. Women were assigned to receive antiretrovirals and LNSs antiretrovirals only LNSs only or a control. Antiretrovirals and LNSs were given to the mothers from weeks 0 to 28. The antiretrovirals were zidovudinelamivudine and nelfinavir or lopinavirritonavir. LNSs provided 93-118 of the Recommended Dietary Allowances of thiamin riboflavin niacin pyridoxine and vitamin B-12. Infants were exclusively breastfed. RESULTS LNSs increased milk concentrations of all vitamins except thiamin whereas antiretrovirals lowered concentrations of nicotinamide pyridoxal and vitamin B-12. Although antiretrovirals alone had no significant effect on riboflavin concentrations they negatively affected the LNS-induced increase in this vitamin. Thiamin was not influenced by the study interventions. Concentrations of all B vitamins were much lower than usually accepted values. CONCLUSIONS All B vitamins were low in milk and all but thiamin were increased by maternal supplementation with LNSs. Antiretrovirals alone decreased concentrations of some B vitamins in milk. When LNS was given in addition to antiretrovirals the negative effect of antiretrovirals offset the positive effect of LNSs for all vitamins except thiamin. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00164762.",

Molecular markers adjusted for volatility and reactivity were used to calculate PM0.1 source contributions. Wood burning was a significant source of PM0.1 organic carbon OC during the winter months in northern California 17-47 but made smaller contributions in other months 0-8 and was minor in all seasons in Los Angeles 0-5 except December 17 during holiday celebrations. Meat cooking was the largest source of PM0.1 OC across all sites 13-29 followed by gasoline combustion 7-21. Motor oil and diesel fuel combustion made smaller contributions to PM0.1 OC 3-10 and 3-7 respectively. Unresolved sources accounted for 22-56 of the PM0.1 OC. The lack of a clear seasonal profile for this unresolved OC suggests that it may be a primary source rather than secondary organic aerosol SOA. PM0.1 elemental carbon EC was dominated by diesel fuel combustion with less than 15 contribution from other sources. All sources besides wood smoke exhibited relatively constant seasonal source contributions to PM0.1 OC reflecting approximately constant emissions over the annual cycle. Annual-average source contributions to PM0.1 OC calculated with traditional molecular markers were similar to the source contributions calculated with the modified molecular markers that account for volatility and reactivity.",

    "abstract": "Anaplasma phagocytophilum a recently reclassified bacteria in the order Rickettsiales infects many different animal species and causes an emerging tick-borne disease of humans. The genome contains a large number of related genes and gene fragments encoding partial or apparently full-length outer membrane protein MSP2 P44. Previous data using strains isolated from humans in the United States suggest that antigenic diversity results from RecF-mediated conversion of a single MSP2 P44 expression site by partially homologous donor sequences. However whether similar mechanisms operate in naturally infected animal species and the extent of global diversity in MSP2 P44 are unknown. We analyzed the structure and diversity of the MSP2 P44 expression site in strains derived from the United States and Europe and from infections of different animal species including wildlife reservoirs. The results show that a syntenic expression site is present in all strains of A. phagocytophilum investigated. This genomic locus contained diverse MSP2 P44 variants in all infected animals sampled and variants also differed at different time points during infection. Although similar variants were found among different populations of U.S. origin there was little sequence identity between U.S. strain variants including genomic copies from a completely sequenced U.S. strain and expression site variants infecting sheep and dogs in Norway and Sweden. Finally the possibility that combinatorial mechanisms can generate additional diversity beyond the basic donor sequence repertoire is supported by the observation of shared sequence blocks throughout the MSP2 P44 hypervariable region in reservoir hosts. These data suggest similar genetic mechanisms for A. phagocytophilum variation in all hosts but worldwide diversity of the MSP2 P44 outer membrane protein.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Young women have poorer survival after breast cancer than do older women. It is unclear whether this survival difference relates to the unique distribution of hormone receptor HR and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2-defined molecular breast cancer subtypes among adolescent and young adult AYA women aged 15 to 39 years. The purpose of our study was to examine associations between breast cancer subtypes and short-term survival in AYA women as well as to determine whether the distinct molecular subtype distribution among AYA women explains the unfavorable overall breast cancer survival statistics reported for AYA women compared with older women. METHODS Data for 5331 AYA breast cancers diagnosed between 2005 and 2009 were obtained from the California Cancer Registry. Survival by subtype triple-negative HRHER2- HRHER2 HR-HER2 and age-group AYA versus 40- to 64-year-olds was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression with follow-up through 2010. RESULTS With up to 6 years of follow-up and a mean survival time of 3.1 years SD 1.5 years AYA women diagnosed with HR-HER and triple-negative breast cancer experienced a 1.6-fold and 2.7-fold increased risk of death respectively from all causes HR-HER hazard ratio 1.55 95 confidence interval CI 1.10 to 2.18 triple-negative HR 2.75 95 CI 2.06 to 3.66 and breast cancer HR-HER hazard ratio 1.63 95 CI 1.12 to 2.36 triple-negative hazard ratio 2.71 95 CI 1.98 to 3.71 than AYA women with HRHER2- breast cancer. AYA women who resided in lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods had public health insurance and were of Black compared with White raceethnicity experienced worse survival. This raceethnicity association was attenuated somewhat after adjusting for breast cancer subtypes hazard ratio 1.33 95 CI 0.98 to 1.82. AYA women had similar all-cause and breast cancer-specific short-term survival as older women for all breast cancer subtypes and across all stages of disease. CONCLUSIONS Among AYA women with breast cancer short-term survival varied by breast cancer subtypes with the distribution of breast cancer subtypes explaining some of the poorer survival observed among Black compared with White AYA women. Future studies should consider whether distribution of breast cancer subtypes and other factors including differential receipt of treatment regimens influences long-term survival in young compared with older women.",

Forty foals born on the same breeding farm were diagnosed with suspected clinical EPE between September 2019 and January 2020. Data of these cases were analyzed retrospectively regarding the course of the disease treatment outcome and long-term prognosis. All horses including randomly selected control horses were reassessed about nine months after the suspicion of EPE. The horses affected were between 5 and 10 months of age. Fever was the most common clinical sign. Hypoproteinemia was shown consistently in all cases. Seroconversion was detected in all horses affected while fecal shedding of Lawsonia intracellularis via qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was only found in 21 cases. Treatment was based on tetracyclines and the administration of equine plasma IV. A total of 39 of 40 foals survived EPE. No long-term effects in terms of poor body condition or abnormal blood values were observed. If diagnosed and treated early EPE can generally be described as a disease with a good prognosis and no long-term effects in Warmblood horses.",

Treatment options include cryosurgery curettage electrosurgery and shave removal. OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and complications of pulsed dye laser PDL therapy for the treatment of DPN with those of curettage and electrodesiccation. METHODS AND MATERIALS Randomized controlled single-center evaluator-blinded trial of 10 patients with at least four clinically diagnosed lesions. RESULTS All 10 patients completed the study. Mean lesion clearance was 96 for curettage 92.5 for electrodesiccation and 88 for laser. There was no significant difference between the three treatment modalities. All three techniques had an overall cosmetic outcome of good for most patients. Five of the 10 patients preferred electrodesiccation. Patients rated the laser as the most painful treatment method. The most common adverse outcome was hyperpigmentation. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for any of the measured outcomes. CONCLUSION The efficacy of PDL in the treatment of DPN is not significantly different from the already established treatment modalities of electrodesiccation and curettage. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.",

    "abstract": "A mandatory tomato-free period TFP was implemented in the state of Gois Brazil in 2007 to help manage diseases caused by whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses. The impact of the TFP was examined in five locations across three states in Central Brazil from 2013 to 2016. Surveys revealed significant differences in begomovirus disease incidence among locations i.e. low in Guara-TFP and Patos de Minas-TFP moderate-high in Itabera-TFP and Morrinhos-TFP and high in the non-TFP NTFP control Cristalina-NTFP. PCR tests and DNA sequencing were used to validate the symptoms and showed that all collected symptomatic plant samples were infected with tomato severe rugose virus ToSRV a common indigenous bipartite begomovirus. Early season surveys 20 to 40 days after transplants DAT in Itabera-TFP and Morrinhos-TFP revealed significantly less begomovirus disease in fields established sooner after the TFP 0 to 2 months compared with incidences in i equivalent early planted fields in the Cristalina-NTFP control and ii fields established longer after the end of the TFP 2 to 5 months. Whitefly infestation of crops was detected year-round in all locations and years and all tested adults were classified in the Bemisia tabaci MEAM1 cryptic species. Infestation levels were significantly higher during the summer but did not vary significantly among locations. Results of monthly monitoring of adult whiteflies for general begomovirus and ToSRV were positively correlated and were indicators of disease incidence in the field. Notably ToSRV was not detected in whiteflies collected from nontomato plants during the TFP and there was a longer lag period before detection in whiteflies collected from processing tomatoes for Itabera-TFP and Morrinhos-TFP compared with Cristalina-NTFP. Taken together with the low levels of ToSRV infection detected in potential nontomato reservoir hosts at all locations our results revealed low levels of primary inoculum during the TFP. Thus even in a complex agroecosystem with year-round whitefly infestation of crops the TFP was beneficial due to delayed and reduced begomovirus disease pressure during a critical stage of plant development first month and for favoring low levels of primary inoculum. Thus we concluded that the TFP should be part of a regional integrated pest management IPM program targeting ToSRV in Brazil.",

We also derive new results we enumerate the corrections to the large-N relations to all orders in 1 N and write an explicit effective lagrangian for baryon chiral perturbation theory which respects chiral symmetry to all orders in 1 N.

A rodent-adapted genospecies named DU1 found primarily in woodrats is unable to infect horses. We developed a real-time PCR RT-PCR assay which targets an 85 base pair region of the ank gene and is specific for the pathogenic genospecies of A. phagocytophilum from North America. Thirty DNA samples from A. phagocytophilum RT-PCR-positive rodents and ticks for which the ank gene had previously been sequenced and had been identified as either the pathogenic genospecies or DU1 were used for validation. All nine samples with the pathogenic genospecies tested positive using the new RT-PCR and all 21 samples with the DU1 genospecies tested negative. Two strains from which the whole genome has been sequenced and are known to be pathogenic A. phagocytophilum strain HZ isolated from a human from New York and strain MRK isolated from a horse from California both tested positive using the new RT-PCR assay. We also tested blood from 20 horses and six dogs that were RT-PCR-positive using a previously validated RT-PCR protocol all were PCR-positive using the new assay as well. The assay has high efficiency and reproducibility and there was no cross-reaction with related and tick-borne bacteria tested although the assay cross-reacts with the ungulate-adapted genospecies Ap-Variant 1. This new RT-PCR assay will aid in future research on the ecology and epidemiology of A. phagocytophilum by allowing researchers to easily identify the pathogenic genospecies in reservoir hosts and vectors.",

    "abstract": "Almost all of our information on the Ghaznavids comes from two contemporary chronicles one in Persian and one in Arabic and a divan poetic anthology from the early eleventh century. The Arabic text is the Tarikh-i Yamini written by Abu Nasr al-Utbi and the Persian chronicle is the Zayn al-Akhbar by Gardizi. Virtually all subsequent Persian chroniclers drew on the later Persian translation of the Yamini. After the Mughal period a few used Gardizi as well. In the nineteenth century H. M. Elliot translated parts of the Persian translation of Utbi into English which popularised that particular version of events in modern scholarship. This uncritical overreliance on a single source has led to perhaps the greatest misunderstanding of medieval Indian history. I will argue that the version of the Ghaznavid campaigns in Utbi was meant strictly for the court of the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad where a sufficiently learned audience could actually be expected to understand the very difficult Arabic of the text. The Yamini did not simply embellish reality but was actually trying to create a narrative that was in contradiction to and even independent of reality. It was part of a campaign of misinformation to hide the fact that the Ghaznavids were creating an Indian empire both as a network of tributary kings and as an open trade zone ruled by a king of kings symbolised by the elephant.",

Our research uses rigorous methods to explore the impact of mandatory public reporting of all-cause readmission rates following CABG surgery in California. We used a hierarchical logistic regression model on 173 823 CABG patient records. This model standardised outcomes across 10 U.S. states that were not previously comparable due to different CABG definitions and metrics. Additionally in order to account for the differences in medical practice across different states we applied a differencein-difference method to estimate the impact of public reporting. Finally a recycled prediction method was used to estimate the number of averted readmissions following public reporting initiation in California.",

In contrast the associated problem of selectivity that is directing fluorination to specific sites in complex molecules remains a great fundamental challenge. In this report we show that the enone functional group upon photoexcitation provides a solution. Based solely on orientation of the oxygen atom site-selective photochemical fluorination is achieved on steroids and bioactive polycycles with up to 65 different sp3 C-H bonds. We have also found that - - homoallylic and allylic fluorination are all possible and predictable through the theoretical modes reported herein. Lastly we present a preliminary mechanistic hypothesis characterized by intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer radical fluorination and ultimate restoration of the enone. In all these results provide a leap forward in the design of selective fluorination of complex substrates that should be relevant to drug discovery where fluorine plays a prominent role.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel approach for treatment planning using digital fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN for proton beam radiation therapy PBRT planning for ocular melanoma. The authors used a prototype version of EYEPLAN software which allows for digital registration of high-resolution fundus photographs. The authors examined the improvement in tumor localization by replanning with the addition of fundus photo superimposition in patients with macular area tumors. METHODS The new version of EYEPLAN v3.05 software allows for the registration of fundus photographs as a background image. This is then used in conjunction with clinical examination tantalum marker clips surgeons mapping and ultrasound to draw the tumor contour accurately. In order to determine if the fundus image superimposition helps in tumor delineation and treatment planning the authors identified 79 patients with choroidal melanoma in the macular location that were treated with PBRT. All patients were treated to a dose of 56 GyE in four fractions. The authors reviewed and replanned all 79 macular melanoma cases with superimposition of pretreatment and post-treatment fundus imaging in the new EYEPLAN software. For patients with no local failure the authors analyzed whether fundus photograph fusion accurately depicted and confirmed tumor volumes as outlined in the original treatment plan. For patients with local failure the authors determined whether the addition of the fundus photograph might have benefited in terms of more accurate tumor volume delineation. RESULTS The mean follow-up of patients was 33.6 - 23 months. Tumor growth was seen in six eyes of the 79 macular lesions. All six patients were marginal failures or tumor miss in the region of dose fall-off including one patient with both in-field recurrence as well as marginal. Among the six recurrences three were managed by enucleation and one underwent retreatment with proton therapy. Three patients developed distant metastasis and all three patients have since died. The replanning of six patients with their original fundus photograph superimposed showed that in four cases the treatment field adequately covered the tumor volume. In the other two patients the overlaid fundus photographs indicated the area of marginal miss. The replanning with the fundus photograph showed improved tumor coverage in these two macular lesions. For the remaining patients without local failure replanning with fundus photograph superimposition confirmed the tumor volume as drawn in the original treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS Local control was excellent in patients receiving 56 GyE of PBRT for uveal melanomas in the macular region which traditionally can be more difficult to control. Posterior lesions are better defined with the additional use of fundus image since they can be difficult to mark surgically. In one-third of treatment failing patients the superposition of the fundus photograph would have clearly allowed improved localization of tumor. The current practice standard is to use the superimposition of the fundus photograph in addition to the surgeons clinical and clip mapping of the tumor and ultrasound measurement to draw the tumor volume.",

The objective of this study was to describe and compare the temporal properties of l and dmenthol. The cooling burning and bitterness of two menthol isomers l d each at 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.08 wv in aqueous solution were evaluated by 11 trained panelists using timeintensity methodology. The intensity of all three attributes were evaluated continuously from introduction of the sample into the mouth through expectoration at 10 s until the termination of the sensation. The lmenthol samples had a greater maximum intensity and longer total duration of cooling and burning sensations than the dmenthol samples. In addition maximum intensity and total duration of cooling and burn increased with concentration. In contrast the total duration of the burning sensation was only dependent upon concentration of the lisomer. Increasing menthol concentration significantly increased maximum intensity and total duration of bitterness for both isomers. Copyright 1995 Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",

    "abstract": "Evidence of 176Hf excess in select meteorites older than 4556Ma was suggested to be caused by excitation of long-lived natural radionuclide 176Lu to its short-lived isomer 176mLu due to an irradiation event during accretion in the early solar system. A result of this process would be a deficit in 176Lu in irradiated samples by between 1 and 7. Previous measurements of the Lu isotope ratio in rock samples have not been of sufficient precision to resolve such a phenomenon. We present a new analytical technique designed to measure the 176Lu175Lu isotope ratio in rock samples to a precision of 0.1 using a multicollector inductively coupled mass spectrometer MC-ICPMS. To account for mass bias we normalized all unknowns to Ames Lu. To correct for any drift and instability associated with mass bias all standards and samples are doped with W metal and normalized to the nominal W isotopic composition. Any instability in the mass bias is then corrected by characterizing the relationship between the fractionation factor of Lu and W which is calculated at the start of every analytical session. After correction for isobaric interferences in particular 176Yb we were able to measure 176Lu175Lu ratios in samples to a precision of 0.1. However these terrestrial standards were fractionated from Ames Lu by an average of 1.22 0.09. This offset in 176Lu175Lu is probably caused by isotopic fractionation of Lu during industrial processing of the Ames Lu standard. To allow more straightforward data comparison we propose the use of NIST3130a as a bracketing standard in future studies. Relative to NIST3130a the terrestrial standards have a final weighted mean 176Lu value of 0.11 0.09. All samples have uncertainties of better than 0.11 hence our technique is fully capable of resolving any differences in 176Lu of greater than 1.",

Overall across all eight series references to sexual interest were most common followed by references to sexual behavior. References to the risk and negative consequences of sex and references to sexual precaution seldomly occurred. Rape was the most frequently occurring term related to sex followed by the term kiss. As for each individual series analyses revealed distinct patterns of the specific categories of sex referenced. In general these findings offer an overview on the different types of sex content referenced in Netflix-originated adolescent series and suggest that adolescents may potentially be affected differently upon exposure to different patterns of sex references in these series.",

    "abstract": "This paper conducts a benefit-cost analysis of expanding agricultural research and development RD in the Global South. We extend a recent modeling exercise that used IFPRIs IMPACT model to estimate the investments required to reduce the global prevalence of hunger below 5. After 35 years the increased funding is estimated to increase agricultural output by 10 reduce the prevalence of hunger by 35 reduce food prices by 16 and increase per capita incomes by 4 relative to a counterfactual where funding continues to rise on historical trends. Using an 8 discount rate the net present value of the costs of agricultural RD are estimated at 61 billion for the next 35 years while the net present benefits in terms of net economic surplus the sum of consumer and producer surplus are estimated at 2.1 trillion. The central estimate of the benefit-cost ratio BCR is 33 consistent with previous research documenting high average returns to agricultural research and development. The central BCR reported in this study places the intervention at the 91st percentile of all previous Copenhagen Consensus BCRs in agriculture and 87th percentile for all BCRs regardless of sector. Agricultural RD is likely one of the best uses of resources for the remainder of the Sustainable Development Goals and decades beyond.",

To fill this gap here we compare network indices of grooming huddling and aggression calculated from data collected from three macaque species through two sampling methods focal animal sampling FAS and all-occurrences behaviour sampling ABS. We found that measures of direct connectedness degree centrality and network density were correlated between FAS and ABS for all social behaviours. Eigenvector and betweenness centralities were correlated for grooming and aggression networks across all species. By contrast for huddling we found a correlation only for betweenness centrality while eigenvector centralities were correlated only for the tolerant bonnet macaque but not so for the despotic rhesus macaque. Grooming and huddling network modularity and centralization were correlated between FAS and ABS for all but three of the eight groups. By contrast for aggression network we found a correlation for network centralization but not modularity between the sampling methodologies.

Descriptions were elicited in a referential communication task where shared information was manipulated and in a guessing game where clues had to be provided about the identity of an object that was hidden from the addressee. Across these tasks increasingly complex levels of audience design were assessed 1 the ability to give adequate descriptions from ones own perspective 2 the ability to adjust descriptions to an addressees perspective when this differs from ones own and 3 the ability to provide indirect yet identifying descriptions in a situation where explicit labeling is inappropriate. Results showed that there were group differences in all three cases with the HFA group giving less efficient descriptions with respect to the relevant context than the comparison group. More revealing was the identification of distinct adaptation profiles among the HFA participants those who had difficulty with all three levels those who displayed Level 1 audience design but poor Level 2 and Level 3 design and those demonstrated all three levels of audience design like the majority of the comparison group. Higher structural language ability rather than symptom severity or social skills differentiated those HFA participants with typical adaptation profiles from those who displayed deficient audience design consistent with previous reports of language use in autism.",

SSRs presented a high level of polymorphism and greater information content as assessed by the expected hetrozygosity compared to AFLPs and RAPDs. The lowest values of expected hetrozygosity were obtained for AFLPs however AFLPs showed the highest efficiency owing to their capacity to reveal large numbers of bands per reaction which led to high values for various types of indices of diversity. All the three techniques discriminated almond genotypes very effectively except that SSRs failed to discriminate between Monagha and Sefied almond genotypes. The correlation coefficients of similarity were statistically significant for all the three marker systems but were lower for the SSR data than for RAPDs and AFLPs. For all the markers high similarity in dendrogram topologies was obtained although some differences were observed. All the dendrograms including that obtained by the combined use of all the marker data reflect relationships for most of cultivars according to their geographic diffusion. AMOVA detected more variation among cultivated and related wild species of almond within each geographic group. Bootstrap analysis revealed that the number of markers used was sufficient for reliable estimation of genetic similarity and for meaningful comparisons of marker types.

    "abstract": "B cell lymphomas are a diverse group of clinicopathologic diseases with an increasing incidence. As with other malignancies the accumulation of genetic abnormalities are required for malignant transformation of human lymphocytes. Cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 is a key biosynthetic enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous malignancies including colon breast and lung cancer. There is little data on the potential role of COX-2 in lymphoma pathogenesis. In this study several B lymphoma cell lines and primary B cells obtained from normal volunteer controls were examined for COX-2 protein expression. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated between an approximately 2.2-4.3-fold increase in COX-2 protein expression relative to primary B cells in all lymphoma cell lines examined. Increased COX-2 phosphorylation was found in the BJAB BL41 and Raji cells whereas the levels in Daudi Namalwa and Ramos did not differ from that of primary B cells. Treatment with 25-100 microM celecoxib CEL resulted in decreased proliferation as measured by 3Hthymidine in all cell lines examined and the effect was dose-dependent and not significantly enhanced by chlorambucil CHL. The effect of COX-2 inhibition on apoptosis in lymphoma cells was examined and revealed apoptotic induction of greater than 85 in all cell lines examined at 50 microM celecoxib. The pro-apoptotic effect was dose-dependent and was not significantly enhanced by chlorambucil. Examination of apoptosis-related proteins by immunoblot analysis revealed levels of BCL-2 BCL-XL and Bax to be unaffected by celecoxib. In contrast levels of Akt MCL-1 and phosphorylated SAP-kinase were all decreased after incubation with 50 microM celecoxib. These findings suggest that increased COX-2 expression and activity contributes to the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas and point to a possible role for COX-2 inhibition in their treatment.",

    "abstract": "The Air Resources Board ARB led a multi-division multi-agency research effort to collect emissions data from two late-model heavy-duty transit buses in three different configurations. The objectives of the study were 1 to assess driving cycle effects 2 to evaluate toxicity between new and clean heavy duty engine technologies in use in California and 3 to investigate total PM and ultrafine particle emissions. Chassis dynamometer testing was conducted at ARBs Heavy-duty Emissions Testing Laboratory HDETL in Los Angeles. The impetus behind this work was to compare the emissions from transit buses powered by similar engines and fueled by Emission Control Diesel ECD-1 and compressed natural gas CNG. Three vehicle configurations were investigated 1 a CNG bus equipped with a 2000 DDC Series 50G engine 2 a diesel bus equipped with a 1998 DDC Series 50 engine and a catalyzed muffler and 3 the same diesel vehicle retrofitted with a Johnson Matthey Continuously Regenerating Technology CRT diesel particulate filter DPF in place of the muffler. The CNG engine was certified for operation without an oxidation catalyst. The diesel vehicle was fueled by ARCO a BP company ECD-1. The duty cycles were 1 idle operation 2 a 55 mph steady-state SS cruise condition 3 the Central Business District CBD cycle 4 the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule UDDS and 5 the New York City Bus Cycle NYBC. Collection of PM over multiple cycles was performed to ensure sufficient sample mass for subsequent chemical analyses. Information on regulated NOx HCs PM and CO and non-regulated CO2 NO2 gas-phase toxic HCs carbonyl compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAH elements and elemental and organic carbon emissions was collected. Size-resolved PM mass and number emission measurements were conducted and extracts from diesel and CNG total PM samples were tested in the Ames mutagenicity bioassay analysis. Some preliminary results were reported in 1. Emissions of measured pollutants showed cycle dependence. The shortest cycle the NYBC resulted consistently in the highest gmi emissions of all regulated CO2 and NO2 for the CRT emissions for all three vehicle configurations. Diesel OxiCat total PM emissions were the highest as expected compared to the CRT and CNG configurations. But the CRT was able to achieve an average reduction of 85 across all cycles based on data uncorrected for tunnel blanks. The CNG without oxidation catalyst resulted in the highest emissions of THC and CO relative to the diesel configurations. Total Diesel OxiCat NOx levels were essentially unchanged by the CRT and were higher compared to the CNG. However during the CNG re-test total NOx showed a considerable increase relative to earlier results. The CRT catalyst generated NO2NO x fractions that ranged from 40 to 50 across all cycles. This is in contrast to the NO2 emission fractions from the Diesel OxiCat which were in the single-digit percentage range. This paper presents results for the regulated NO2 and CO2 emissions for all cycles except idle and an overview of the entire project.

    "abstract": "Hypoalbuminemia predicts death in dialysis patients. Although hypoalbuminemia has been attributed to malnutrition evidence of inflammation C-reactive protein CRP and cytokine levels has recently been recognized to predict albumin concentration in dialysis patients. We measured CRP and albumin levels in October 1995 in 91 hemodialysis HD patients. During a 34-month follow-up period we determined the incidence and cause of death. Patients were divided into four groups based on serum albumin levels 3.5 lowest quartile 3.5 to 3.8 3.9 to 4.0 and 4.0 gdL highest quartile. Survival differed among the four groups P 0.0063. Patients with albumin levels greater than 4.0 gdL had the greatest survival. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of patients from varying CRP quartiles 2.6 2.6 to 5.2 5.3 to 11.5 and 11.5 microgmL differed among the four groups P 0.0001. The group with the greatest CRP level 11.5 microgmL had the lowest survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that only CRP level chi-square 21.11 P 0.0001 and age chi-square 5.44 P 0.020 predicted death. Albumin level chi-square 0.16 P 0.69 was not predictive. Only when CRP was excluded from the model did low serum albumin level chi-square 12. 04 P 0.0004 predict death. CRP level chi-square 16.79 P 0. 0001 and age chi-square 6.38 P 0.012 also superceded albumin level chi-square 0.45 P 0.51 in predicting cardiovascular mortality. Although values for blood urea nitrogen creatinine and normalized protein catabolic rate were significantly less among patients who died these parameters as well as cholesterol level and diabetes were not important predictors of death in multivariate analysis. The acute-phase response or the cause of the acute-phase response is largely responsible for the effect of hypoalbuminemia on mortality in HD patients.",

    "abstract": "Background Necrotizing enterocolitis NEC is the leading cause of gastrointestinal morbidity in preterm infants and prevention and treatment strategies have remained largely unchanged over the past several decades. As understanding of the microbiome has increased probiotics have been hypothesized as a possible strategy for decreasing rates of NEC and several studies have noted significant decreases in rates of NEC after initiation of probiotics in preterm infants. However a recent AAP report cited caution on the use of probiotic use in part because studies of probiotic use in ELBW infants are lacking. As our unit began routine use of probiotics for all infants 33 weeks in 2015 and we are a leading institution for intact survival of ELBW infants we attempted to answer if probiotic use can impact the rate of NEC in VLBW and ELBW infants. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective chart review of infants with modified Bells stage 2a NEC for the 4 years prior to and 5 years after initiation of a protocol involving routine supplementation of a multispecies probiotic to premature infants at the University of Iowa Stead Family Childrens Hospital. The primary outcome measures were rates of modified Bells stage 2a NEC and all-cause pre-discharge mortality at our institution before and after initiation of routine probiotic supplementation in 2015. Results In our institution neither the rates of modified Bells stage 2a NEC nor the rates of all-cause mortality were significantly altered in very low birth weight VLBW infants by the initiation of routine probiotic use NEC rates pre-probiotic 2.1 vs. post-probiotic 1.5 all-cause mortality rates pre-probiotic 8.4 vs. post-probiotic 7.4. Characteristics of our two cohorts were overall similar except for a significantly lower 5-minute APGAR score in infants in the post-probiotic epoch pre-probiotic 8 vs. post-probiotic 6 p 0.0316 and significantly more infants in the post-probiotic epoch received probiotics pre-probiotics 0 vs. post-probiotics 65 p 0.0001. Similarly probiotic use had no impact on the incidence of NEC when we restricted our data to only extremely low birth weight ELBW infants pre-probiotics 1.6 vs post-probiotics 4.1. When we restricted our analysis to only inborn infants probiotics still had no impact on NEC rates in VLBW infants 1.5 pre- and 1.1 post-probiotic p 0.61 or ELBW infants 2 pre- and 2.1 post-probiotic p 0.99 Conclusions Contrary to other studies we found no significant difference in rates of modified Bells stage 2a NEC or all-cause pre-discharge mortality in VLBW infants following routine administration of a multispecies probiotic supplement.",

This review provides a broad overview of some of the physiological differences in special populations and discusses how these differences may affect study design and regulatory considerations. These various special populations with respect to regulatory affairs are clearly defined within the Code of Federal Regulations. The definition of special population exists to provide enhanced awareness of their vulnerabilities thereby allowing the creation of regulatory guidance aimed to decrease injury or outright harm. Currently progress is being made to be more inclusive of special populations in clinical trials. This reflects changing attitudes towards drug information with it being more representative of those patients that will ultimately be prescribed or exposed to the therapy. However all research undertaken in these populations should be performed in a manner that ensures all protections of each participant are upheld.",

Combining an analysis of field survey data literature review and expert assessment by a multidisciplinary working group we examined the degree to which Caribbean coastal habitats provide useful planning information on 4 conservation measures species richness the ecological functions of fish species ecosystem processes and ecosystem services. Approximately one-quarter to one-third of benthic invertebrate species and fish species disaggregated by life phase hereafter fish species occurred in a single habitat and Montastraea-dominated forereefs consistently had the highest richness of all species processes and services. All 11 habitats were needed to represent all 277 fish species in the seascape although reducing the conservation target to 95 of species approximately halved the number of habitats required to ensure representation. Species accumulation indices SAIs were used to compare the efficacy of surrogates and revealed that fish species were a more appropriate surrogate of benthic species SAI 71 than benthic species were for fishes SAI 42. Species of reef fishes were also distributed more widely across the seascape than invertebrates and therefore their use as a surrogate simultaneously included mangroves sea grass and coral reef habitats. Functional classes of fishes served as effective surrogates of fish and benthic species which given their ease to survey makes them a particularly useful measure for conservation planning. Ecosystem processes and services exhibited great redundancy among habitats and were ineffective as surrogates of species. Therefore processes and services in this case were generally unsuitable for a complementarity-based approach to reserve design. In contrast the representation of species or functional classes ensured inclusion of all processes and services in the reserve network.",

    "abstract": "The complex thermal gradients of additive manufacturing AM result in residual stress and distinctive grain morphologies that influence mechanical performance and contribute to concern regarding the fatigue properties of AM parts. In this study residual stress microstructure and fatigue crack growth rate FCGR results were compared in AM Type 304L stainless steel produced by laser powder bed fusion PBF on different systems using similar process parameters. Residual stress measured in the build direction was remarkably consistent in all PBF builds. Backscatter electron large area images revealed similar grain morphologies in the different builds all of which exhibited elongated grains in the build direction and inhomogeneous grain size and shape. Fatigue crack growth investigated both parallel and perpendicular to the build direction revealed higher measured crack growth rates in the near-threshold regime in both orientations of the PBF material compared to wrought material. The difference in near-threshold fatigue crack growth rates is attributed primarily to the influence of processing-induced residual stress quantified by the residual stress intensity factor. These values revealed consistent FCGR effects in each orientation across specimens extracted from different builds and were then used to reveal a convergence of the corrected FCGR data of all PBF and wrought specimens.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify gene expression differences in blood differences in children with autism AU and autism spectrum disorder ASD compared to general population controls. Transcriptional profiles were compared with age- and gender-matched typically developing children from the general population GP. The AU group was subdivided based on a history of developmental regression A-R or a history of early onset A-E without regression. Total RNA from blood was processed on human Affymetrix microarrays. Thirty-five children with AU 17 with early onset autism and 18 with autism with regression and 14 ASD children who did not meet criteria for AU were compared to 12 GP children. Unpaired t tests corrected for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate of 0.05 detected a number of genes that were regulated more than 1.5-fold for AU versus GP n55 genes for A-E versus GP n140 genes for A-R versus GP n20 genes and for A-R versus A-E n494 genes. No genes were significantly regulated for ASD versus GP. There were 11 genes shared between the comparisons of all autism subgroups to GP AU A-E and A-R versus GP and these genes were all expressed in natural killer cells and many belonged to the KEGG natural killer cytotoxicity pathway p0.02. A subset of these genes n7 was tested with qRT-PCR and all genes were found to be differentially expressed p0.05. We conclude that the gene expression data support emerging evidence for abnormalities in peripheral blood leukocytes in autism that could represent a genetic andor environmental predisposition to the disorder.",

Three fuel cell city buses and 497 other low-emission vehicles are now serving the Olympic core area and Beijing urban areas. The fuel cell buses will operate along a fixed bus line for 1 year as a public demonstration of green energy vehicles. Due to the specialized nature of fuel cell engines and electrified power-train systems measurement monitoring and calibration devices are indispensable. Based on the latest Bluetooth wireless technology a novel Bluetooth universal data interface was developed for the control system of the fuel cell city bus.

ANIMALS 32 incontinent female dogs with intramural ectopic ureters. PROCEDURES A diagnosis of intramural ectopic ureters was made via cystoscopy and fluoroscopy in all patients. Transurethral CLA-EU via diode laser n 27 or Holmiumyttrium aluminum garnet laser 3 was performed to relocate the ectopic ureteral orifice cranially into the urinary bladder. All vaginal anomalies were treated with the laser concurrently. Follow-up evaluation was standardized and included urinary continence scoring serial bacteriologic culture of urine samples and a follow-up cystoscopy 6 to 8 weeks after CLA-EU. RESULTS Ectopic ureteral orifices of all dogs were initially located in the urethra. Eighteen of 30 dogs had bilateral ectopic ureters and 12 had unilateral ectopic ureters. All dogs had other concurrent urinary anomalies. At the time of last follow-up median 2.7 years after CLA-EU range 12 to 62 months 14 of 30 47 dogs did not require any additional treatments following CLA-EU to maintain urinary continence. For the 16 residually incontinent dogs the addition of medical management transurethral bulking-agent injection or placement of a hydraulic occluder was effective in 3 2 and 4 dogs respectively improving the overall urinary continence rate to 77 2330 dogs. One dog had evidence of polypoid cystitis at the neoureteral orifice 6 weeks after CLA-EU that was resolved at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE CLA-EU provided an effective safe and minimally invasive alternative to surgery for intramural ectopic ureters in female dogs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The genetic basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is not entirely clear. While there are families with rare highly penetrant mutations in CuZn superoxide dismutase 1 and several other genes that cause apparent Mendelian inheritance of the disease most ALS occurs in families without another affected individual. However twin studies suggest that all ALS has a substantial genetic basis. Herein we estimate the genetic contribution to ALS in a clinically ascertained case series from the United States. METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used the database of the Emory ALS Center to ascertain individuals with ALS along with their family histories to determine the concordance among parents and offspring for the disease. We found that concordance for all parent-offspring pairs was low 2. With this concordance we found that ALS heritability or the proportion of the disease explained by genetic factors is between 40 and 45 for all likely estimates of ALS lifetime prevalence. CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE We found the lifetime risk of ALS is 1.1 in first-degree relatives of those with ALS. Environmental and genetic factors appear nearly equally important for the development of ALS.",

    "abstract": "From just about all accounts Americans are driving more than ever not just to work but to shopping to school to soccer practice and band practice to visit family and friends and so on. Americans also seem to be complaining more than ever about how much they drive-or more accurately how much everyone else drives. However the available evidence suggests that a notable share of their driving is by choice rather than necessity. Although the distinction between choice and necessity is not always so clear it is important for policy makers. For necessary trips planners can explore ways of reducing the need for or length of the trip or ways of enhancing alternatives to driving. For travel by choice the policy implications are much trickier and touch on basic concepts of freedom of choice. This paper first develops a framework for exploring the boundary between choice and necessity based on a categorization of potential reasons for and sources of excess driving and then uses in-depth one-on-one interviews guided by this framework to characterize patterns of excess driving. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of travel behavior and provides a basis for developing policy proposals directed at reducing the growth in driving. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here by using a systems approach we provide experimental evidence including protein-coimmunoprecipitation ChIP-Chip GTF perturbation and knockout and measurement of transcriptional changes in these genetically perturbed strains for how archaea likely accomplish similar large-scale transcriptional segregation and modulation of physiological functions. We are able to associate GTFs to nearly half of all putative promoters and show evidence for at least 7 of the possible 42 functional GTF pairs.

In each scenario we double the service frequency of buses on the focus routes and reduce the frequency on all other routes to maintain the total vehicle revenue miles making the changes roughly cost-neutral. We tested these scenarios for Oshkosh Wisconsin and Atlanta Georgia using a modeling framework that combines CityCast a commercially available data-driven planning tool to replicate observed travel patterns and MATSim to simulate how travelers would change the route mode and time-of-day of the trips they make in response to the service changes. The results show substantial ridership gains for all but one scenario suggesting that these strategies may provide a promising low-cost means of increasing transit ridership in some contexts. However impacts varied across the two case studies indicating that local conditions play a role.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE There are marked racial differences in the incidence of testicular germ cell tumors among United States men with whites having 5 times the incidence of blacks and 3 times that of Asians. Testicular germ cell tumors in boys are rare and limited racial classification by cancer registries has made attempts to discern racial patterns difficult. We hypothesize that recent diversification of race data by cancer registries may allow for more accurate racial classification and that there are racial differences in the incidence of testicular germ cell tumors in prepubertal boys. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified all cases of histologically confirmed testicular germ cell cancer in boys 0 to 14 years old between 1992 and 2004 through the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program. We performed subgroup analysis in boys 0 to 9 years old. Race was categorized as white black American IndianAlaska Native or AsianPacific Islander. Variables analyzed included age tumor histology and year of diagnosis. RESULTS A total of 695 cases of testicular germ cell tumors were diagnosed among boys of all races with an overall incidence of 6.3 per 1 million person-years. Testicular germ cell tumors were 1.4-fold more likely to develop in AsianPacific Islanders compared to whites RR 1.4 95 CI 1.1 to 1.8. Increased rates among AsianPacific Islanders were constant across all age strata in cases of yolk sac tumorembryonal teratoma and seminoma and were maintained from 1992 to 2004. CONCLUSIONS AsianPacific Islander boys are more likely to have testicular germ cell tumors compared to whites. Similar to adults race appears to have a significant role in the incidence of testicular germ cell tumors among prepubertal boys.",

Using a prospective study design we examined the association of caregiving with mortality in a cohort of older women. METHODS Participants were 158987 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years at enrollment into the Womens Health Initiative WHI who provided information on current caregiving status and caregiving frequency at baseline 1993-1998 and follow-up 2004-2005. Mortality was ascertained from baseline through March of 2019. Cox regression with caregiving status defined as a time-varying exposure was used to estimate hazard ratios HR and 95 confidence intervals CI for mortality adjusting for sociodemographic factors smoking and history of diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease CVD and cancer. Stratified analyses explored whether age race-ethnicity depressive symptoms frequency of caregiving optimism and living status modified the association between caregiver status and mortality. RESULTS At baseline 40.7 of women mean age 63.3 years self-identified as caregivers. During a mean 17.5-year follow-up all-cause mortality 50526 deaths was 9 lower multivariable-adjusted HR 0.91 95 CI 0.89-0.93 in caregivers compared to non-caregivers. The inverse association between caregiving and all-cause mortality did not differ according to caregiving frequency or when stratified by age race-ethnicity depressive symptoms optimism or living status interaction p 0.05 all. Caregiving was inversely associated with CVD and cancer mortality. CONCLUSION Among postmenopausal women residing across the United States caregiving was associated with lower mortality.

    "abstract": "Bovine respiratory disease BRD is often diagnosed in feedlots after observing behavioral changes such as anorexia with fever confirmatory. However this method has poor diagnostic accuracy compared to postmortem lung lesions. Little is known about how these or other sickness responses such as low grooming present in early spontaneous BRD especially during feedlot acclimation. To inform improved detection we studied 3 aspects of the BRD sickness response at and before diagnosis and the effect of acclimation on behavior in beef heifers. We hypothesized that heifers with BRD would have fever and spend less time feeding and grooming compared to controls and that both behaviors would increase with acclimation. Beef heifers were randomized to replicate and pen balanced for body weight total n 80 and monitored for 12 d starting 2 d after shipping. Rectal temperature was measured with a logger while feeding time and brush use were video-recorded. Clinical signs were recorded daily heifers remaining healthy over the entire 12 d were Controls n 46 those meeting set criteria were classified as BRD n 21. Health effects were analyzed for all 3 dependent variables on the day of diagnosis d 0 and for fever and feeding the 2 days before d 1 and 2 using analogous days for Controls. Acclimation effects were tested separately using all available behavioral data. BRD heifers had a fever on d 0 and 2 0.4 C higher than Control P 0.01 but not on d 1 P 0.10. After excluding 4 outliers all Controls never seen at the feed bunk BRD heifers had lower feeding time on d 0 19 less than Control P 0.04 but not on d 1 or 2 P 0.32 or at all when outliers were included P 0.32. BRD had no effect on brush use 29.6 6.6 vs. 19.8 4.4 min18.5 h P 0.22. While feeding behavior was stable over time P 0.28 the effect of outliers suggests that acclimation may also affect anorexia-based diagnosis of individual heifers. Brush use results also reflect the effect of acclimation to a novel device evidenced by generally increased grooming later compared to earlier days P 0.01. Fever occurring first and anorexia may be useful in early BRD diagnosis. However in recently-arrived cattle effects of acclimation should be considered when monitoring behavior for sickness detection.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Firearm injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. However many medical professionals currently receive minimal or no education on firearm injury or its prevention. The authors sought to convene a diverse group of national experts in firearm injury epidemiology injury prevention and medical education to develop consensus on priorities to inform the creation of learning objectives and curricula for firearm injury education for medical professionals. METHOD In 2019 the authors convened an advisory group that was geographically demographically and professionally diverse composed of 33 clinicians researchers and educators from across the United States. They used the nominal group technique to achieve consensus on priorities for health professions education on firearm injury. The process involved an initial idea-generating phase followed by a round-robin sharing of ideas and further idea generation facilitated discussion and clarification and the ranking of ideas to generate a prioritized list. RESULTS This report provides the first national consensus guidelines on firearm injury education for medical professionals. These priorities include a set of crosscutting basic and advanced learning objectives applicable to all contexts of firearm injury and all medical disciplines specialties and levels of training. They focus on 7 contextual categories that had previously been identified in the literature 1 category of general priorities applicable to all contexts and 6 categories of specific contexts including intimate partner violence mass violence officer-involved shootings peer nonpartner violence suicide and unintentional injury. CONCLUSIONS Robust data- and consensus-driven priorities for health professions education on firearm injury create a pathway to clinician competence and self-efficacy. With an improved foundation for curriculum development and educational program-building clinicians will be better informed to engage in a host of firearm injury prevention initiatives both at the bedside and in their communities.",

    "abstract": "AIMS Molecular investigation of small-cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcaemic type SCCOHT has revealed that it is a monogenetic tumour characterized by alteration of SMARCA4 BRG1 encoding a member of the switchsucrose non-fermentable SWISNF chromatin remodelling complex. A large majority of cases show loss of expression of the corresponding SMARCA4BRG1 protein. Furthermore three cases of SCCOHT with retained SMARCA4 protein expression showed loss of SMARCB1INI1 expression. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of loss of SMARCA4 expression as a diagnostic test for SCCOHT. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed SMARCA4 and SMARCB1 staining in 245 tumours many of which were potentially in the differential diagnosis of SCCOHT. We also stained 56 cases of SCCOHT for SMARCA4 and 37 of these for SMARCB1. Fifty-four of the SCCOHT cases showed complete absence of SMARCA4 expression. The two cases with retained expression showed molecular alteration of SMARCA4. Of the 217 other neoplasms with interpretable staining all retained SMARCA4 expression. Although the majority showed diffuse strong nuclear expression a heterogeneous typically weak staining pattern was present in 13 of cases. All 37 cases of SCCOHT tested and all other neoplasms apart from three malignant rhabdoid tumours showed retained nuclear SMARCB1 expression. Loss of SMARCA4 expression had a sensitivity of 96.55 and specificity of 100. CONCLUSIONS Loss of SMARCA4 expression is sensitive and specific for SCCOHT. Although some mimics show heterogeneous expression there is retention of nuclear staining in at least a part of the tumour therefore only complete loss of staining should be regarded as being supportive of SCCOHT.",

Classifying leukemia in horses can be challenging if blasts predominate and since few antibodies to identify cell types are available. The objective of this study was to describe in detail the clinical and pathologic features of acute leukemia in horses. Twelve horses ranging from 0.2 to 25.9 years of age were diagnosed with acute leukemia. Six cases were classified as acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL based on predominance of blasts lack of granulocytic or monocytic differentiation and detection of CD3 CD20 andor CD79a antigens by immunohistochemistry. Six other cases were classified as acute myeloid leukemia AML with myelomonocytic n 4 basophilic n 1 and eosinophilic n 1 differentiation based on 20 bone marrow blasts and partial leukocytic differentiation. Reactivity with antibodies to Iba-1AIF-1 CD172a and CD163 was determined for all cases of AML. Eleven horses had thrombocytopenia 10 had neutropenia 8 had anemia all had blasts on blood films and none had leukocytosis. Ten horses had increased serum acute phase proteins. Bone marrow cellularity ranged from 30 to 100 and the proportion of blasts ranged from 80 to 100 and 30 to 60 in ALL and AML respectively. Horses were severely ill at diagnosis and euthanized within days or weeks. Unique features of acute leukemia in horses compared to other species were variable lymphocyte antigen expression ALL and frequent inflammation ALL and AML.",

This systematic review addresses 2 questions 1 What is the quality of the development and recommendations of these BPGs and 2 What are the areas of agreement and discrepancy among the identified guidelines related to the RTW from mental illness-related disability leave METHOD A systematic literature search was performed using publically available grey literature and best practice portals. It focused on the RTW of workers with medically certified disability leave related to mental disorders. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II AGREE II was used to assess the quality of the development and recommendations of these BPGs. RESULTS A total of 58 unique documents were identified for screening. After screening 5 BPGs were appraised using AGREE II 3 BPGs were included in the final set. There were no discrepancies among the 3 although they were from different countries. They all agreed there should be 1 well-described organizational policies and procedures for the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders 2 a disability leave plan and 3 work accommodations. In addition one guideline suggested supervisor training and mental health literacy training for all staff. CONCLUSION Although there were no discrepancies among the 3 BPGs they emphasized different aspects of RTW and could be considered to be complementary. Together they provide important guidance for those seeking to understand employer best practices for mental illness-related disability.",

Two environments-the remote marine boundary layer and the South Coast Air Basin of Los Angeles SoCAB-were considered. Our analysis points out that the observed mode separation cannot result from condensational or coagulational growth. In both the marine boundary layer and the SoCAB H2O2O3 sulfate formation in droplets during clouds or fogs provides all the features required for explaining the bimodality.

METHODS 100 females with BI-RADS 45 lesions underwent CEbCT andor DBT prior to biopsy in this IRB approved HIPAA compliant study. Two breast radiologists adjudicated lesion conspicuity scores CS for each modality independently. Data are shown as mean CS standard deviation. Two-sided t-test was used to determine significance between two modalities within each subgroup. Multiple comparisons were controlled by the false-discovery rate set to 5. RESULTS 50 of studied lesions were biopsy-confirmed malignancies. Malignant masses were more conspicuous on CEbCT than on DBT or DM 9.7 0.5 n 25 6.8 3.1 n 15 6.7 3.0 n 27 p 0.05. Malignant calcifications were equally conspicuous on all three modalities CEbCT 8.7 0.8 n 18 DBT 8.5 0.6 n 15 DM 8.8 0.7 n 23 p NS. Benign masses were equally conspicuous on CEbCT 6.6 4.1 n 22 DBT 6.4 3.8 n 17 DM 5.9 3.6 n 24 p NS. Benign calcifications CS were similar between DBT 8.5 1.0 n 17 and DM 8.8 0.8 n 26 p NS but less conspicuous on CEbCT 4.0 2.9 n 25 p 0.001. 55 females were imaged with all modalities. Results paralleled the entire cohort. 69n 62 of females imaged by CEbCT had dense breasts. Benignmalignant lesion CSs in densenon-dense categories were 4.8 3.7 n 33 vs 6.0 3.9 n 14 p 0.35 9.2 0.9 n 29 vs. 9.4 0.7 n 14 p 0.29 respectively. CONCLUSION Malignant masses are more conspicuous on CEbCT than DM or DBT. Malignant microcalcifications are equally conspicuous on all three modalities. Benign calcifications remain better visualized by DM and DBT than with CEbCT. We observed no differences in benign masses on all modalities. CS of both benign and malignant lesions were independent of breast density. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE CEbCT is a promising diagnostic imaging modality for suspicious breast lesions.",

Previously we discovered a potential therapeutic molecular target MDX3 MAX dimerization protein 3 in preB ALL. In this study we hypothesize that an effective siRNA therapy for preB ALL can be developed using antiCD22 antibody CD22 Ab and nanoparticles. We composed nanocomplexes with super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles SPIO NPs CD22 Abs and MXD3 siRNA molecules based on physical interactions between the molecules. We demonstrated that the MXD3 siRNA-CD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes entered leukaemia cells and knocked down MXD3 leading the cells to undergo apoptosis and resulting in decreased live cell counts in the cell line Reh and in primary preB ALL samples in vitro. Furthermore the cytotoxic effects of the MXD3 siRNA-CD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes were significantly enhanced by addition of the chemotherapy drugs vincristine or doxorubicin. We also ruled out potential cytotoxic effects of the MXD3 siRNA-CD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes on normal primary haematopoietic cells. Normal B cells were affected while CD34-positive haematopoietic stem cells and non-B cells were not. These data suggest that MXD3 siRNA-CD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes have the potential to be a new targeted therapy for preB ALL.",

A simple yet efficient method to identify the strongest pulse over all orientations in multicomponent ground motions is presented in this study through rotating the ground motions to the orientation associated with the maximum peak ground velocity PGV. It is demonstrated that the pulse-like ground motion components in the orientation with the maximum PGV value have the potential to produce the largest meanmedian ductility than the components rotated to all remaining orientations. A comparison of the proposed methodology with an existing method is also performed further demonstrating that the proposed maximum PGV methodology can accurately identify the strongest pulse. The determined strongest pulse can be utilized in engineering practice to estimate the maximum seismic demands on structures.",

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspBackground Multiple small retrospective studies have suggested that ALL can occur as a secondary cancer but the diagnosis of sALL remains controversial. Furthermore its clinical significance remains poorly defined. Using population based data we examined a large retrospective cohort of patients with sALL to determine the risk factors for and prognostic impact of sALL compared to ALL without preceding cancer.jatsp jatspMethods Patients diagnosed with ALL during 1988-2012 were identified in the California Cancer Registry CCR n15135. Cases were considered sALL if they were preceded by any other malignancy except primary acute leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia Burkitt leukemialymphoma lymphoblastic lymphoma or non-hodgkin lymphoma not otherwise specified. Non-menaloma skin cancer is not captured by CCR and thus was not included considered a first malignancy. We determined standard incidence ratios SIR for sALL by comparing expected rates of ALL from the CCR to observed rates in patients with a previous malignancy. Hematologic malignancies and breast thyroid and germ cell cancers were identified as potential high-risk patients in prior reports. SIRs for these tumors and for colorectal and prostate cancer due to their frequency were calculated. The effect of sALL compared to primary ALL on overall survival OS was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models accounting for age sex race year of diagnosis histology neighborhood socioeconomic status SES marital status and rural vs urban residence.jatsp jatspResults Secondary ALL accounted for 3.7 n566 of patients diagnosed with ALL in the CCR. Compared to primary ALL sALL was more common in females 43 vs 55 plt0.0001 non-Hispanic Whites 37 vs 62.9 plt0.0001 older patients 21 over the age of 40 vs 87 more likely to be diagnosed in 2008-2012 than before 23 vs 31 plt0.0001 and in patients residing in the highest two quintiles of SES 17 vs 22 p0.002 and 16 vs 27 plt0.0001 respectively. The most common first primary tumor sites among sALL patients were breast 14 male genital system 10 lymphoma 8 and digestive system 6.7. The primary tumor site was unknown in 30 of cases.jatsp jatspThe SIRs of developing sALL are summarized in the Table. Of note both men and women were more likely to develop ALL after a preceding malignancy than the background population overall SIR 1.7 95 CI 1.5 - 1.8 male SIR 1.4 1.2 - 1.6 and female SIR 2.0 1.8 - 2.4. While hematologic malignancies and endocrinethyroid cancers increased the risk in men and women germ cell tumors increased the risk of sALL only in men expectedly breast cancer increased the risk only in women.jatsp jatspCompared to primary ALL the adjusted hazard ratio aHR of death for patients with sALL was 1.07 0.96-1.18 p0.2. A second model considered type of prior malignancy to sALL hematologic malignancies solid tumors with statistically significant SIRs gt1 breast thyroid and germ cell and other tumors. Compared to primary ALL patients with sALL after a prior hematologic malignancy had a significantly increased risk of death aHR 1.38 1.07 - 1.8 while those with prior breastthyroidgerm cell aHR 1.18 0.95 - 1.46 or any other primary aHR 1.12 0.96 - 1.31 cancers did not.jatsp jatspConclusions To our knowledge this study represents the largest cohort of sALL reported to date and establishes sALL as a clinically relevant subtype of ALL. Although the risk of developing sALL is increased for patients with any prior malignancy only specific cancers provide excess risk. Furthermore the risk of death was increased in sALL patients with a prior hematologic cancer. Our findings provide evidence that sALL is clinically distinct entity and have implications for both survivorship of solid and hematologic cancer and risk stratification of ALL. Further study into the etiology of sALL and the possibility that sALL is therapy related is warranted.jatsp jatspTable 1.

    "abstract": "jatstitleAbstractjatstitle jatspIntroduction Adolescent and young adult AYA cancer survivors are at an increased risk of developing subsequent medical problems including asthmachronic obstructive pulmonary disorder cardiovascular disease diabetes and second cancers. However few population-based studies have focused on these risks in AYAs with NHL ALL or AML or considered whether the occurrence of these and other medical conditions differ by sociodemographic factors.jatsp jatspMethods Data for patients aged 15-39 when diagnosed with NHL n4459 ALL n1100 and AML n1107 during 1996-2012 and surviving a minimum of 2 years were obtained from the California Cancer Registry and followed in California hospital discharge databases. Discharge diagnoses were used to classify medical conditions as cardiac hypertensive disease ischemic heart disease other heart disease neurologic stroke seizure endocrine hypothyroidism diabetes ovariantesticular dysfunction other metabolic diseases respiratory asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease renal chronic kidney disease hemodialysis kidney transplant liver chronic liver disease pancreatitis cirrhosis liver transplant and avascular necrosis. Second cancers were obtained from the cancer registry. We estimated the cumulative incidence CMI of developing each condition 10-years after diagnosis accounting for death as a competing risk. We determined the impact of raceethnicity neighborhood socioeconomic status SES health insurance status and stem cell transplant SCT on the occurrence of each medical condition after adjusting for other demographic and clinical factors using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.jatsp jatspResults The most common medical conditions among AYA survivors at 10-years were cardiac CMI NHL 11.6 ALL 20.5 AML 18.2 endocrine CMI NHL 18.6 ALL 33.0 AML 25.9 and respiratory CMI NHL 5.1 ALL 7.7 AML 6.8 diseases. Avascular necrosis had the highest CMI in ALL patients CMI NHL 1.2 ALL 8.7 AML 2.5. Neurologic CMI NHL 2.1 ALL 4.5 AML 4.9 and liver CMI NHL 2.0 ALL 5.6 AML 4.4 were more common in survivors of ALL and AML than NHL. Second cancers 2.3-2.5 and renal diseases 2.2-3.5 were less common at 10-years. NHL survivors with advanced stage disease had a higher incidence of all medical conditions except second cancers. Chemotherapy was associated with a higher CMI of cardiac and endocrine conditions among NHL survivors these associations could not be assessed in ALL and AML patients as nearly all patients received chemotherapy. Initial radiation therapy was not associated with a higher CMI of medical conditions in NHL or ALL survivors but was associated with a higher CMI of respiratory renal and endocrine diseases in AML survivors. In multivariable models public or no insurance vs private was associated with a higher risk of most medical conditions in NHL and ALL survivors but not AML survivors Table. The risk of developing medical conditions varied by raceethnicity with Hispanics ALL survivors vs non-Hispanic whites at a higher risk of cardiac renal liver endocrine second cancers and neurologic diseases and black AML survivors at a higher risk of all medical conditions except endocrine diseases. AYAs with NHL who resided in lower SES neighborhoods were at a higher risk for developing cardiac respiratory and endocrine diseases AML survivors in lower SES neighborhoods had a higher risk of respiratory diseases. Across all cancers AYAs undergoing a SCT were at a higher risk of most medical conditions.jatsp jatspConclusion This study found that sociodemographic factors were associated with the risk of developing medical conditions in AYA NHL ALL and AML survivors. As expected the risk of medical conditions varied by cancer type and treatment with those undergoing SCT having a higher risk of medical conditions regardless of cancer type. NHL and ALL survivors who were uninsured or publicly insured were at a consistently higher risk of developing medical conditions as were Hispanic ALL survivors and Black AML survivors. Our findings highlight the higher burden of medical conditions in subgroups of cancer survivors that may relate to reduced access to preventive care early detectionintervention and long-term surveillance.jatsp jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspMuffly Shire Pharmaceuticals Research Funding Adaptive Biotechnologies Research Funding.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Urethral obstruction secondary to artificial urethral sphincter AUS implantation is a recognized complication in dogs. However urethral obstruction secondary to AUS-associated capsule formation has been described rarely. HYPOTHESIS Describe clinical and diagnostic findings management and outcome in 6 dogs with urethral obstruction secondary to AUS-associated capsule formation. ANIMALS Six client-owned dogs. METHODS Retrospective study. Medical records between January 1 2010 and June 30 2021 were reviewed to identify dogs with urethral obstruction associated with the AUS device. RESULTS The AUS device was implanted a median of 884 days range 20-2457 days before presentation for urethral obstruction. Median age at time of urethral obstruction was 4.7 years range 3.1-8.7 years. Clinical signs at the time of urethral obstruction were stranguria n 4 pollakiuria 3 weak urine stream 2 and worsened urinary incontinence 1. In all dogs the urethra was noted to be stenotic during urethroscopy and positive contrast cystourethrography. All dogs underwent surgery and a fibrous capsule associated with the AUS was found to be causing urethral stenosis. Resolution of urethral obstruction occurred in all dogs after transection or removal of the capsule. Positive bacterial cultures were obtained from the capsule AUS or both in all dogs. Recurrence of urethral obstruction had not occurred in any dog at the time of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Urethral obstruction secondary to capsule formation is an uncommon but clinically important complication associated with use of the AUS. Continued investigation is needed to evaluate this complication more thoroughly and its possible association with infection.",

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Eight tertiary-care referral general hospitals in California. METHODS We used FY 2016 data and the published 2015 rebaseline NHSN HO-CDI SIR. We compared facility-wide inpatient HO-CDI events and SIRs with and without ICU data oncology andor HCT unit data and ICU bed adjustment. RESULTS For these hospitals the median unmodified HO-CDI SIR was 1.24 interquartile range IQR 1.15-1.34 7 hospitals qualified for the highest ICU bed adjustment 1 hospital received the second highest ICU bed adjustment and all had oncology-HCT units with no additional adjustment per the NHSN. Removal of ICU data and the ICU bed adjustment decreased HO-CDI events median -25 IQR -20 to -29 but increased the SIR at all hospitals median 104 IQR 90-105. Removal of oncology-HCT unit data decreased HO-CDI events median -15 IQR -14 to -21 and decreased the SIR at all hospitals median -8 IQR -4 to -11. CONCLUSIONS For tertiary-care referral hospitals with specialized ICUs and a large number of ICU beds the ICU bed adjustor functions as a global adjustment in the SIR calculation accounting for the increased complexity of patients in ICUs and non-ICUs at these facilities. However the SIR decrease with removal of oncology and HCT unit data even with the ICU bed adjustment suggests that an additional adjustment should be considered for oncology and HCT units within general hospitals perhaps similar to what is done for ICU beds in the current SIR.",

Such studies in PDAC are hampered by presentation at advanced stages and rarely operable recurrences. We present a case of metachronous PDAC managed by serial resections and interrogated by whole genome sequencing of all three lesions.jatsp jatspMethods Tumors underwent either laser capture microscopy or flow cytometry of fresh frozen tissue. Germline DNA was obtained from normal tissue. Genomic DNA was isolated and sequencing libraries were prepared. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500 system. Pipeline analysis included quality control alignment to the reference genome hg19 variant calling and annotation. Structural variants were called by the union of two tools DELLY and CREST. Copy number variants were called using an in-house tool. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and short insertions and deletions were identified by the intersection of two tools Strelka and MuTect and annotated using ANNOVAR. All structural copy number and non-silent variants were manually reviewed in the Integrated Genome Viewer. Secondary analyses were done in R. Representative sections of the three tumors also underwent formalin fixation paraffin embedding sectioning at five micron thickness and hematoxylin and eosin staining for microscopic analysis.jatsp jatspResults The first tumor was located in the head of the pancreas and resected by Whipple operation the second and third in the body and tail respectively and resected by completion pancreatectomy 14 months later. The patient received chemotherapy in the interim.jatsp jatspHistologically all 3 tumors were moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas with focal mucinous areas and extensive lymphovascular and perineural invasion. There were no distinguishing morphological features.jatsp jatspFor the 3 lesions we achieved average sequence coverage of 52.3x 54.3x and 70.7x respectively.jatsp jatspA total of 69 structural variants and 62 copy number variants were identified with concordance of 75 and 92 in all three lesions.jatsp jatspA total of 61 non-silent exonic variants were identified with concordance of 33 in all three lesions. A KRAS NM_004985 c.G34C missense and TP53 NM_001126115 c.G418A missense were present in all three whereas a SMAD4 NM_005359 c.118delC frameshift was present in only the second and third tumors.jatsp jatspHierarchical clustering by non-silent variants copy number variants and an intersect of all variants showed the tumors in the head and tail to be more closely related to one another than to the body lesion whereas clustering by structural variants showed little difference between the three.jatsp jatspConclusions The highly similar structural and copy number profiles across the three lesions suggests that these tumors arose from a common precursor and that large chromosomal changes occurred early in its mutational evolution.jatsp jatspThe poor concordance of simple somatic mutations imply that these evolved gradually and are responsible for tumor heterogeneity and possibly acquired phenotypes include therapeutic resistance.jatsp jatspThis study also demonstrates that isolated intra-parenchymal metastases as opposed to de novo tumors within a field defect are possible with PDAC which has been suggested in case reports but never definitively proven further implying that these patients may benefit from re-operation despite disease relapse.jatsp jatspFurther analysis will include mathematical modeling of mutation rates and validation in three additional metachronous cases identified in our biospecimen repository and in specimens obtained by our rapid autopsy program.jatsp jatspCitation Format Ashton A.

Antifungal drug susceptibility can vary with molecular type but the susceptibility of Cryptococcus isolates from dogs and cats is largely unknown. Cryptococcus isolates from 15 dogs and 27 cats were typed using URA5 restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis RFLP PCR fingerprinting and multilocus sequence typing MLST. Susceptibility was determined using a microdilution assay Sensititre YeastOne Trek Diagnostic Systems. MICs were compared among groups. The 42 isolates studied comprised molecular types VGI 7 VGIIa 7 VGIIb 5 VGIIc 5 VGIII 38 VGIV 2 VNI 33 and VNII 2 as determined by URA5 RFLP. The VGIV isolate was more closely related to VGIII according to MLST. All VGIII isolates were from cats. All sequence types identified from veterinary isolates clustered with isolates from humans. VGIII isolates showed considerable genetic diversity compared with other Cryptococcus molecular types and could be divided into two major subgroups. Compared with C. neoformans MICs C. gattii MICs were lower for flucytosine and VGIII MICs were lower for flucytosine and itraconazole. For all drugs except itraconazole C. gattii isolates exhibited a wider range of MICs than C. neoformans. MICs varied with Cryptococcus species and molecular type in dogs and cats and MICs of VGIII isolates were most variable and may reflect phylogenetic diversity in this group. Because sequence types of dogs and cats reflect those infecting humans these observations may also have implications for treatment of human cryptococcosis.",

METHOD Participants with normal cognition NC mild cognitive impairment MCI and Alzheimers disease AD were included from all ADNI waves. We used data from each persons last study visit to calibrate scores for memory executive function language and visuospatial functioning. We extracted item information functions for each domain and used these to calculate standard errors of measurement. We derived scores for each domain for each diagnostic group and plotted standard errors of measurement for the observed range of scores. RESULTS Across all waves there were 961 people with NC 825 people with MCI and 694 people with AD at their most recent study visit data pulled February 25 2019. Across ADNIs battery there were 34 memory items 18 executive function items 20 language items and seven visuospatial items. Scores for each domain were highest on average for people with NC intermediate for people with MCI and lowest for people with AD with most scores across all groups in the range of -1 to 1. Standard error of measurement in the range from -1 to 1 was highest for memory intermediate for language and executive functioning and lowest for visuospatial. CONCLUSION Modern psychometric approaches provide tools to help understand measurement precision of the scales used in studies.

    "abstract": "Moraxella ovis was historically the only coccoid Moraxella identified in cultures of ocular fluid from cattle with infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis IBK and could be morphologically and biochemically differentiated from Moraxella bovis. Moraxella bovoculi sp. nov. is a recently characterized Moraxella isolated from ulcerated eyes of calves with IBK in northern California in 2002. Like Moraxella ovis M. bovoculi sp. nov. is a gram-negative coccusdiplococcus. All 18 original isolates of M. bovoculi sp. nov. possessed phenylalanine deaminase PADase activity and could therefore be differentiated from M. ovis and M. bovis. During the characterization of 44 additional isolates of hemolytic gram-negative cocci that were cultured from ulcerated eyes of IBK-affected calves 2 PADase-negative isolates were identified that could not be differentiated biochemically from M. ovis however the DNA sequence of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region ISR of the isolates matched the 16S-23S ISR DNA sequence of M. bovoculi sp. nov. To facilitate the identification of PADase-negative moraxellae a polymerase chain reaction PCR coupled with restriction enzyme digestion analysis of amplified DNA was developed. Amplification of the 16S-23S ISR followed by AfaI digestion of amplified DNA could differentiate M. bovoculi sp. nov. from M. ovis and other moraxellae. The DNA sequence analysis of the amplified 16S-23S ISR from the 42 PADase-positive isolates of hemolytic gram-negative cocci indicated that all were M. bovoculi sp. nov. and all possessed an AfaI site. A PCR coupled with restriction analysis of amplified DNA can aid in identifying M. bovoculi sp. nov.",

MDB and retinal nerve fiber layer RNFL thickness values were determined for 4 quadrants and 4 sectors using a spectral-domain OCT device. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUROC values sensitivities specificities and positive and negative predictive values. RESULTS The best AUROC values of 3D MDB thickness for glaucoma and early glaucoma were for the overall globe 0.969 0.952 followed by the inferior quadrant 0.966 0.949 and inferior-temporal sector 0.966 0.944 and then followed by the superior-temporal sector 0.964 0.932 and superior quadrant 0.962 0.924. All 3D MDB thickness AUROC values were higher than those of 2D RNFL thickness. Pairwise comparisons showed that the diagnostic performance of the 3D MDB parameter was significantly better than 2D RNFL thickness only for the nasal quadrant and inferior-nasal and superior-nasal sectors P .023-.049. Combining 3D MDB with 2D RNFL parameters provided significantly better diagnostic performance AUROC 0.984 than most single MDB parameters and all single RNFL parameters. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the 2D RNFL thickness parameter the 3D MDB neuroretinal rim thickness parameter had uniformly equal or better diagnostic performance for glaucoma in all regions and was significantly better in the nasal region.",

Dogs with severe PS echocardiographically derived trans-pulmonary peakmaximum pressure gradient EDPG 80 mmHg were recruited. All dogs underwent echocardiography before and 20-24hrs after HPBVP using a high-pressure balloon with rated burst pressures ranging from 12 to 18 ATM. Procedural success was defined as a post-HPBVP EDPG reduction of 50 or reduction into at least the moderate category of PS 50-79 mmHg. Optimal result was defined as a post-procedural EDPG 30 mmHg. RESULTS Initial median IQR EDPG for all dogs was 96 88 127 mmHg with a post-operative median of 48 36 65 mmHg. The median EDPG reduction provided by HPBVP was 63 39 68 procedural success rate was 92 23 dogs. Optimal results were achieved in 56 14 dogs. There were no significant correlations between EDPG reduction and valve morphology Type A and Type B or severity of right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonary valve annulus diameter was the only echocardiographic variable that was significantly correlated to EDPG reduction p 0.02 r -0.46. No dog experienced any anesthetic or surgical complications and all patients survived the procedure. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of 25 dogs with severe PS HPBVP was safe and effective.

Methods We performed a chart review using ICD-9 codes to identify women aged 14-40 years who received chemotherapy at our institution during July 2008-June 2013. Electronic medical records were examined for menstrual suppression therapy contraception counseling and abnormal vaginal bleeding. Results We identified 137 women for this study. 24 18 received prophylactic menstrual suppression counseling of whom 17 71 initiated treatment primarily with combined oral contraceptives all prescribed by hematologist-oncologists. During the first 6 months of chemotherapy 36 women 26 complained of abnormal vaginal bleeding including 10 women who were on prophylactic treatment. 19 women noted moderate to severe bleeding. 11 12 women received contraceptive counseling before chemotherapy all from hematologist-oncologists 86 women 63 initiated chemotherapy without a documented contraceptive method. Limitations Data were generated from billing codes so all eligible women may not have been included. Conclusions Reproductive-age women undergoing chemotherapy may not receive adequate contraception and menstrual suppression counseling.

    "abstract": "Through analyses of audience reception of U.S.-produced feature film projects from the period 2000-2003 I develop insight into the trade-off assumed in organizational ecology theory between an organizations niche width and its fitness. This assumption termed the principle of allocation holds that the greater the diversity in regions of resource space targeted by an organization the lower the organizations capacity to perform well within them. Using data at both the professional critic and consumer levels I demonstrate the empirical validity of this principle films targeting more genres attract larger audiences but are less appealing to those audience members. Moreover I find that audiences perceptions of a films fit with targeted genres drive this trade-off as multi-genre films are difficult for audiences to make sense of leading to poor fit with tastes and lowered appeal. These findings highlight the key role audiences perceptions play in the trade-offs associated with different niche strategies. 2006 by Johnson Graduate School.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This study aims to evaluate the potential and feasibility of positron emission tomography for dynamic lung tumor tracking during radiation treatment. The authors propose a center of mass CoM tumor tracking algorithm using gated-PET images combined with a respiratory monitor and investigate the geometric accuracy of the proposed algorithm. METHODS The proposed PET dynamic lung tumor tracking algorithm estimated the target position information through the CoM of the segmented target volume on gated PET images reconstructed from accumulated coincidence events. The information was continuously updated throughout a scan based on the assumption that real-time processing was supported actual processing time at each frame 10 s. External respiratory motion and list-mode PET data were acquired from a phantom programmed to move with measured respiratory traces external respiratory motion and internal target motion from human subjects for which the ground truth target position was known as a function of time. The phantom was cylindrical with six hollow sphere targets 10 13 17 22 28 and 37 mm in diameter. The measured respiratory traces consisted of two sets 1 1D-measured motion from ten healthy volunteers and 2 3D-measured motion from four lung cancer patients. The authors evaluated the geometric accuracy of the proposed algorithm by quantifying estimation errors Euclidean distance between the actual motion of targets 1D-motion and 3D-motion traces and CoM trajectories estimated by the proposed algorithm as a function of time. RESULTS The time-averaged error of 1D-motion traces over all trajectories of all targets was 1.6 mm. The error trajectories decreased with time as coincidence events were accumulated. The overall error trajectory of 1D-motion traces converged to within 2 mm in approximately 90 s. As expected more accurate results were obtained for larger targets. For example for the 37 mm target the average error over all 1D-motion traces was 1.1 mm and for the 10 mm target the average error over all 1D-motion traces was 2.8 mm. The overall time-averaged error of 3D-motion traces was 1.6 mm which was comparable to that of the 1D-motion traces. There were small variations in the errors between the 3D-motion traces although the motion trajectories were very different. The accuracy of the estimates was consistent for all targets except for the smallest. CONCLUSIONS The authors developed an algorithm for dynamic lung tumor tracking using list-mode PET data and a respiratory motion signal and demonstrated proof-of-principle for PET-guided lung tumor tracking. The overall tracking error in phantom studies is less than 2 mm.",

    "abstract": "The fragile X premutation PM allele contains a CGG expansion of 55-200 repeats in the FMR1 genes promoter. Male PM carriers have an elevated risk of developing neurological and psychiatric changes including an approximately 50 risk of the fragile X-associated tremorataxia syndrome FXTAS. The aim of this study was to assess the relationships of regional white matter hyperintensities wmhs semi-quantitative scores clinical status motor UPDRS ICARS Tremor scales and cognitive impairments with FMR1-specific genetic changes in a sample of 32 unselected male PM carriers aged 39-81 years. Half of these individuals were affected with FXTAS while the non-FXTAS group comprised subcategories of non-affected individuals and individuals affected with non-syndromic changes. The dynamics of pathological processes at the cellular level relevant to the clinical status of PM carriers was investigated using the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK which is a highly sensitive cellular stress-sensing alarm protein. This enzyme as well as genetic markers - CGG repeat number and the levels of the FMR1 mRNA - were assessed in blood lymphoblasts. The results showed that the repeat distribution for FXTAS individuals peaked at 85-90 CGGs non-FXTAS carriers were distributed within the lowest end of the PM repeat range and non-syndromic carriers assumed an intermediate position. The size of the CGG expansion was significantly correlated across all three categories with infratentorial and total wmhs and with all motor scores and the FMR1 mRNA levels with all the wmh scores whilst AMPK activity showed considerable elevation in the non-FXTAS combined group decreasing in the FXTAS group proportionally to increasing severity of the wmhs and tremorataxia. We conclude that the size of the CGG expansion relates to the risk for FXTAS to severity of infratentorial wmhs lesions and to all three motor scale scores. FMR1 mRNA shows a strong association with the extent of wmhs which is the most sensitive marker of the pathological process. However the AMPK activity findings - suggestive of a role of this enzyme in the risk of FXTAS - need to be verified and expanded in future studies using larger samples and longitudinal assessment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Temperate fruit and nut trees require adequate winter chill to produce economically viable yields. Global warming has the potential to reduce available winter chill and greatly impact crop yields. METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS We estimated winter chill for two past 1975 and 2000 and 18 future scenarios mid and end 21st century 3 Global Climate Models GCMs 3 greenhouse gas emissions GHG scenarios. For 4293 weather stations around the world and GCM projections Safe Winter Chill SWC the amount of winter chill that is exceeded in 90 of all years was estimated for all scenarios using the Dynamic Model and interpolated globally. We found that SWC ranged between 0 and about 170 Chill Portions CP for all climate scenarios but that the global distribution varied across scenarios. Warm regions are likely to experience severe reductions in available winter chill potentially threatening production there. In contrast SWC in most temperate growing regions is likely to remain relatively unchanged and cold regions may even see an increase in SWC. Climate change impacts on SWC differed quantitatively among GCMs and GHG scenarios with the highest GHG leading to losses up to 40 CP in warm regions compared to 20 CP for the lowest GHG. CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE The extent of projected changes in winter chill in many major growing regions of fruits and nuts indicates that growers of these commodities will likely experience problems in the future. Mitigation of climate change through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can help reduce the impacts however adaption to changes will have to occur. To better prepare for likely impacts of climate change efforts should be undertaken to breed tree cultivars for lower chilling requirements to develop tools to cope with insufficient winter chill and to better understand the temperature responses of tree crops.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To characterize the extent to which brief cognitive assessments administered in the population-representative U.S. Health and Retirement Study HRS and its International Partner Studies can be considered to be measuring a single unidimensional latent cognitive function construct. METHODS Cognitive function assessments were administered in face-to-face interviews in 12 studies in 26 countries N 155690 including the U.S. HRS and selected International Partner Studies. We used the time point of the first cognitive assessment for each study to minimize differential practice effects across studies and documented cognitive test item coverage across studies. Using confirmatory factor analysis models we estimated single-factor general cognitive function models and bifactor models representing memory-specific and nonmemory-specific cognitive domains for each study. We evaluated model fits and factor loadings across studies. RESULTS Despite relatively sparse and inconsistent cognitive item coverage across studies all studies had some cognitive test items in common with other studies. In all studies the bifactor models with a memory-specific domain fit better than single-factor general cognitive function models. The data fit the models at reasonable thresholds for single-factor models in 6 of the 12 studies and for the bifactor models in all 12 of the 12 studies. DISCUSSION The cognitive assessments in the U.S. HRS and its International Partner Studies reflect comparable underlying cognitive constructs. We discuss the assumptions underlying our methods present alternatives and future directions for cross-national harmonization of cognitive aging data.",

This study examines this relationship identifying associations between cycling or walking and self-reported health whether socioeconomic status moderates these associations and whether gentrification influences the potential moderating effects. Methods This study uses the 2017 US National Household Travel Survey subset to adults who lived in central cities n 91541. Weighted logistic regression models with interaction terms were fit to estimate self-reported health status separately for cycling and walking. Gentrification was measured using an indicator based on previous research using US Census data. Results Cycling in the previous week and each additional walking trip were associated with higher odds of reporting better health. Socioeconomic status moderated the positive associations between active transportation and health for a few variables. Cyclists of color had smaller health effects from cycling for utilitarian trips while race and ethnicity had only a marginal moderating effect on the association between walking and health. Gentrification was an insignificant moderating factor in general. Conclusions Findings suggest planning efforts that continue to support programs that promote cycling and walking are crucial tools in the public health toolbox. The health gains from active transportation might be experienced in a variety of neighborhood contexts. Nevertheless infrastructure investments and policy must be attentive to inequities across neighborhoods.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND For students entering a science PhD program a tenure-track faculty research position is often perceived as the ideal long-term goal. A relatively small percentage of individuals ultimately achieve this goal however with the vast majority of PhD recipients ultimately finding employment in industry or government positions. Given the disparity between academic career ambitions and outcomes it is useful to understand factors that may predict those outcomes. Toward this goal the current study examined employment status of PhD graduates from biomedical sciences programs at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus CU AMC and related this to metrics of predoctoral publication records as well as to other potentially important factors such as sex and time-since-degree to determine if these measures could predict career outcomes. METHODS Demographic information name PhD program graduation date sex of CU AMC biomedical sciences PhD graduates between 2000 and 2015 was obtained from University records. Career outcomes academic faculty vs. non-faculty and predoctoral publication records number and impact factors of first-author and non-first-author publications were obtained via publicly available information. Relationships between predoctoral publication record and career outcomes were investigated by a comparing faculty vs. non-faculty publication metrics using t-tests and b investigating the ability of predoctoral publication record sex and time-since-degree to predict career outcomes using logistic regression. RESULTS Significant faculty vs. non-faculty differences were observed in months since graduation p 0.001 first-author publication number p 0.001 average first-author impact factor p 0.006 and highest first-author impact factor p 0.004. With sex and months since graduation as predictors of career outcome the logistic regression model was significant p 0.001 with both being male and having more months since graduation predicting career status. First-author related publication metrics number of publications average impact factor highest impact factor all significantly improved model fit 2 0.05 for all and were all significant predictors of faculty status p 0.05 for all. Non-first-author publication metrics did not significantly improve model fit or predict faculty status. DISCUSSION Results suggest that while sex and months since graduation also predict career outcomes a strong predoctoral first-author publication record may increase likelihood of obtaining an academic faculty research position. Compared to non-faculty individuals employed in faculty positions produced more predoctoral first-author publications with these being in journals with higher impact factors. Furthermore first-author publication record sex and months since graduation were significant predictors of faculty status.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED To gain insights into the diversity of Pseudomonas syringae sensu lato affecting sweet cherry in California we sequenced and analyzed the phylogenomic and genomic architecture of 86 fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic cherry tissues. Fifty-eight isolates were phylogenetically placed within the P. syringae species complex and taxonomically classified into five genomospecies P. syringae pv. syringae P. syringae Pseudomonas cerasi Pseudomonas viridiflava and A. We annotated components of the type III secretion system and phytotoxin-encoding genes and correlated the data with pathogenicity phenotypes. Intact probable regulatory protein HrpR was annotated in the genomic sequences of all isolates of P. syringae pv. syringae P. syringae P. cerasi and A. Isolates of P. viridiflava had atypical probable regulatory protein HrpR. Syringomycin and syringopeptin-encoding genes were annotated in isolates of all genomospecies except for A and P. viridiflava. All isolates of P. syringae pv. syringae caused cankers leaf spots and fruit lesions in the field. In contrast all isolates of P. syringae and P. cerasi and some isolates of P. viridiflava caused only cankers. Isolates of genomospecies A could not cause any symptoms suggesting phytotoxins are essential for pathogenicity. On detached immature cherry fruit pathogenicity assays isolates of all five genomospecies produced symptoms black-dark brown lesions. However symptoms of isolates of genomospecies A were significantly P 0.01 less severe than those of other genomospecies. We also mined for genes conferring resistance to copper and kasugamycin and correlated these data with in vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests. IMPORTANCE Comprehensive identification of phytopathogens and an in-depth understanding of their genomic architecture particularly virulence determinants and antibiotic-resistant genes are critical for several practical reasons. These include disease diagnosis improved knowledge of disease epidemiology pathogen diversity and determination of the best possible management strategies. In this study we provide the first report of the presence and pathogenicity of genomospecies Pseudomonas cerasi and Pseudomonas viridiflava in California sweet cherry. More importantly we report a relatively high level of resistance to copper among the population of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 47.5. This implies copper cannot be effectively used to control bacterial blast and bacterial canker of sweet cherries. On the other hand no isolates were resistant to kasugamycin an indication that kasugamycin could be effectively used for the control of bacterial blast and bacterial canker. Our findings are important to improve the management of bacterial blast and bacterial canker of sweet cherries in California.",

    "abstract": "Adhesion is an important initial step during bacterial colonization of the intestinal mucosa. However mutations in the Salmonella typhimurium fimbrial operons lpf pef or fim only moderately alter mouse virulence. The respective adhesins may thus play only a minor role during infection or S. typhimurium may encode alternative virulence factors that can functionally compensate for their loss. To address this question we constructed mutations in all four known fimbrial operons of S. typhimurium fim lpf pef and agf. A mutation in the agfB gene resulted in a threefold increase in the oral 50 lethal dose LD50 of S. typhimurium for mice. In contrast an S. typhimurium strain carrying mutations in all four fimbrial operons quadruple mutant had a 26-fold increased oral LD50. The quadruple mutant but not the agfB mutant was recovered in reduced numbers from murine fecal pellets suggesting that a reduced ability to colonize the intestinal lumen contributed to its attenuation. These data are evidence for a synergistic action of fimbrial operons during colonization of the mouse intestine and the development of murine typhoid fever.",

Results of a preoperative CBC included mild nonregenerative anemia severe thrombocytopenia and 17 unclassified cells. On cytologic examination of aspirates from the dogs enlarged spleen and peripheral lymph nodes a population of primitive round cells that occasionally resembled megakaryocytes was observed. A bone marrow aspirate specimen was markedly hypercellular with approximately 65 of marrow cells comprising a homogeneous population of immature hematopoietic cells similar to those found in the spleen lymph nodes and peripheral blood. Using immunocytochemical stains with canine-specific antibodies all neoplastic cells strongly expressed cytoplasmic CD41 and 20-70 of the neoplastic cells expressed CD34 weakly to moderately. Rare 0.5 neoplastic cells weakly expressed vWF. The cells were negative for all other markers. Based on these results and the morphology of the neoplastic cells a diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia AMegL was made. In spite of treatment results of a CBC performed 1 week later indicated progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia and the dog was euthanized.

Missbach et al. 2014 suggested that ORs instead evolved with an ancestral OR co-receptor Orco after the origin of terrestriality and the OROrco system is an adaptation to winged flight in insects. We investigated genomes of the Collembola Diplura Archaeognatha Zygentoma Odonata and Ephemeroptera and find ORs present in all insect genomes but absent from lineages predating the evolution of insects. Orco is absent only in the ancestrally wingless insect lineage Archaeognatha. Our new genome sequence of the zygentoman firebrat Thermobia domestica reveals a full OROrco system. We conclude that ORs evolved before winged flight perhaps as an adaptation to terrestriality representing a key evolutionary novelty in the ancestor of all insects and hence a molecular synapomorphy for the Class Insecta.",

As all separation distances were represented by independent simulations the proper solvent density for every level of compression needed to be determined to acquire realistic data. This was accomplished by maintaining a constant solvent chemical potential for each separation distance. In doing so each independent simulation is equilibrated with all others reproducing conditions encountered experimentally in force spectroscopy measurements. Chemical potential was determined using the Widom test particle insertion method. Force information was extracted from pressure profiles such that unphysical forces occurring within the surface layers were not accounted for in the calculation. Each individual simulation was a canonical ensemble molecular dynamics simulation but taken together they approximate a grand canonical ensemble for the solvent particles by holding their chemical potential constant.",

    "abstract": "Urban forests often occur as highly fragmented patches with many non-native plant species altered disturbance regimes environmental pollutants and uncertain trajectories of plant community composition. In 1998 the Baltimore Ecosystem Study a U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Long-Term Ecological Research LTER program established eight forested plots to investigate long-term impacts of urbanization on natural ecosystems. All plots were located in the Baltimore metropolitan area with four in urban forest patches and four in a rural forest. In 1998 these forest patches had closed canopies with well-developed tree shrub and vine layers and extensive herbaceous cover. The 1998 alpha diversity species richness was higher in urban plots than in rural plots whereas both plot types had similar forest structure and a relatively small number of non-native species. In 2015 we resampled these plots to investigate changes in plant structure composition and diversity based on the abundance cover and size of plant species. Trees and vines experienced minimal structural changes in all the plots. Sapling shrub and herbaceous abundances all declined over time in the rural plots. In the urban plots however only the sapling and herbaceous layers experienced declines. Despite having fewer structural changes urban plots showed a greater shift in species composition than did rural plots. As in 1998 alpha diversity was lower in the rural plots. Beta diversity community dissimilarity decreased among rural plots but remained nearly unchanged in the urban plots whereas beta turnover species turnover was much higher in the urban plots. These data suggest that the urban plots may have divergent compositional trajectories from the rural plots which may help urban forests retain structural similarities through functional redundancy.",

The effect of cold storage at 0 degrees C on development of superficial scald and bitter pit BP in transgenic Greensleeves GS apples suppressed for ethylene biosynthesis was investigated. Four apple lines were used untransformed GS line 68G suppressed for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ACC oxidase ACO and lines 103Yand 130Y suppressed for ACC synthase ACS. Fruits from the transformed lines 68G 103Y and 130Y produced very little ethylene during 3 months of cold storage at 0 degrees C and after subsequent transfer to 20 degrees C whereas untransformed fruits produced significant ethylene during cold storage which increased dramatically at 20 degrees C. Respiration expressed as CO2 production was similar in all four apple lines. After 2 months at 0 degrees C all apple lines showed some BP symptoms but lines 68G and 103Y were more affected than untransformed GS or line 130Y. Both transformed and untransformed apples produced alpha-farnesene but concentrations were lower in yellow fruit than in green fruit in all lines but 68G. Line 68G produced the most alpha-farnesene after 2 months at 0 degrees C including both EE alpha-farnesene and ZE alpha-farnesene. Concentrations of EE alpha-farnesene were 100 times greater than those of ZE alpha-farnesene in all lines. After 4 months at 0 degrees C plus 1 week at 20 degrees C untransformed GS apples exhibited the most superficial scald whereas fruits from lines 68G and 103Y were less affected and line 130Y had no scald. Superficial scald severity was higher in green fruit than in yellow fruit in all affected lines. These lines also exhibited significant production of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one MHO a major oxidation product of EE alpha-farnesene. Line 130Y neither exhibited superficial scald nor produced MHO. It is shown here that even transgenic apples suppressed for ethylene biosynthesis genes can produce alpha-farnesene which in turn can oxidize to free radicals and MHO leading to scald development.",

The role of this pathogen in nosocomial diarrhea in Eastern Europe has not been clearly established. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of C. difficile in patients and the hospital environment in Belarus and to characterize these isolates as to the presence of toxin genes and their molecular type. C. difficile was isolated from 9 of 509 1.8 patients analyzed and recovered from 28 of 1300 2. 1 environmental sites cultured. A multiplex PCR assay was used to analyze the pathogenicity locus PaLoc of all isolates and strain identity was determined by an arbitrarily primed PCR AP-PCR. The targeted sequences for all the genes in the PaLoc were amplified in all C. difficile strains examined. A predominantly homogeneous group of strains was found among these isolates with five major AP-PCR groups being identified. Eighty-three percent of environmental isolates were classified into two groups while patient isolates grouped into three AP-PCR types two of which were also found in the hospital environment. Although no data on the role of C. difficile infection or epidemiology of C. difficile-associated diarrhea CDAD in this country exist the isolation of toxigenic C. difficile from the hospital environment suggests that this pathogen may be responsible for cases of diarrhea of undiagnosed origin and validates our effort to further investigate the significance of CDAD in Eastern Europe.",

ANIMALS 9 horses. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURES Medical records of horses diagnosed with septic bicipital bursitis between 2000 and 2021 were reviewed. Horses were included if synoviocentesis of the bicipital bursa revealed a total nucleated cell count of 20000 cellsL with a neutrophil proportion of 80 a total protein concentration of 4.0 gdL andor the presence of bacteria on cytology or positive culture of the synovial fluid. Information retrieved from medical records included signalment history clinicopathologic variables diagnostic imaging findings treatment and outcome. RESULTS Trauma was the most common inciting cause n 6. Synoviocentesis using ultrasonographic guidance was performed in all cases and showed alterations consistent with septic synovitis. Radiography identified pathology in 5 horses whereas ultrasonography identified pathology in all horses. Treatment consisted of bursoscopy n 6 of the bicipital bursa of which 1 was performed under standing sedation through-and-through needle lavage 3 bursotomy 2 or medical management alone 2. Five 55.6 horses survived to discharge. Long-term follow-up was available for 3 horses and all were serviceably sound with 2 in training as pleasure horses and 1 case continuing retirement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Ultrasonography was the most informative imaging modality and paramount in obtaining synovial fluid samples for definitive diagnosis of septic bicipital bursitis. Bursoscopy performed under standing sedation is a feasible treatment option. Horses treated for bicipital septic bursitis have a fair prognosis for survival and may return to some level of athletic performance.",

METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted at 3 universities. One hundred eighteen children 14 to 24 months old with autism spectrum disorder were enrolled and randomly assigned to ESDM or community interventions for 27 months. Eighty-one children completed the full treatment course and all assessments data from all 118 children were used in analyses. Children assigned to the ESDM intervention received 3 months of weekly parent coaching followed by 24 months of 15 hour per week on average 11 treatment weekly on average in homes or daycare settings from supervised therapy assistants while parents received coaching 4 hours monthly from a certified ESDM therapist. RESULTS For the primary analyses there were time-by-group and time-by-group-by-site interactions for language outcome. In the significant 3-way interaction involving site 2 sites showed a significant ESDM advantage and the third site showed no significant group differences. In the planned 2-way analysis that pooled data across all 3 sites there was a significant advantage found for the ESDM group. For the secondary analyses there were no significant differences between the ESDM and community groups involving developmental quotient autism severity or adaptive behavior. The treatment effect of group on language outcomes was not moderated by baseline developmental quotient autism severity or language. CONCLUSION Results of the primary analysis provide a partial replication of Dawson et al.s 2010 language findings.

    "abstract": "Mygalomorph spiders which include the tarantulas trapdoor spiders and their kin represent one of three main spider lineages. Mygalomorphs are currently classified into 15 families comprising roughly 2500 species and 300 genera. The few published phylogenies of mygalomorph relationships are based exclusively on morphological data and reveal areas of both conflict and congruence suggesting the need for additional phylogenetic research utilizing new character systems. As part of a larger combined evidence study of global mygalomorph relationships we have gathered approximately 3.7 kb of rRNA data 18S and 28S for a sample of 80 genera representing all 15 mygalomorph families. Taxon sampling was particularly intensive across families that are questionable in composition-Cyrtaucheniidae and Nemesiidae. The following primary results are supported by both Bayesian and parsimony analyses of combined matrices representing multiple 28S alignments 1 the Atypoidea a clade that includes the families Atypidae Antrodiaetidae and Mecicobothriidae is recovered as a basal lineage sister to all other mygalomorphs 2 diplurids and hexathelids form a paraphyletic grade at the base of the non-atypoid clade but neither family is monophyletic in any of our analyses 3 a clade consisting of all sampled nemesiids Microstigmata and the cyrtaucheniid genera Kiama Acontius and Fufius is consistently recovered 4 other sampled cyrtaucheniids are fragmented across three separate clades including a monophyletic North American Euctenizinae and a South African clade 5 of the Domiothelina only idiopids are consistently recovered as monophyletic ctenizids are polyphyletic and migids are only weakly supported. The Domiothelina is not monophyletic. The molecular results we present are consistent with more recent hypotheses of mygalomorph relationship however additional work remains before mygalomorph classification can be formally reassessed with confidence-increased taxonomic sampling and the inclusion of additional character systems more genes and morphology are required.",

To compare corneal thickness measurements between UBM and ultrasonic pachymetry. ANIMALS STUDIED Sixty eyes of 30 healthy adult horses aged 8-24 years. PROCEDURES Ultrasonic pachymetry velocity of 1640 ms was utilized to obtain measurements of the central superior temporal inferior and nasal cornea. Triplicate images of the same corneal locations were acquired using UBM 50 MHz. Images of the axial anterior chamber were used to measure ACD. Intraocular pressure IOP was estimated using rebound tonometry and axial globe length was measured using ultrasonographic biometry. RESULTS CT mean SD m measured by UBM was 854 61 central 994 58 superior 930 57 temporal 979 55 inferior and 898 48 nasal. CT measured by UBM was greater than that measured by ultrasonic pachymetry at all locations and was statistically significant at all locations except inferior p 0.0006-0.048. No sex nor age effect was detected for CT at any location. The repeatability of ultrasonic pachymetry was superior to that of UBM. Mean SD ACD was 5.74 0.41 mm. A weak positive correlation was identified between central CT and IOP and between central CT and axial globe length. CONCLUSIONS Normal data for CT and ACD of the adult horse obtained using UBM are provided. CT determined by UBM was greater relative to pachymetry at all corneal locations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND An alternative approach to the traditional model of radiologists interpreting screening mammography is necessary due to the shortage of radiologists to interpret screening mammograms in many countries. METHODS We evaluated the performance of 15 Mexican radiographers also known as radiologic technologists in the interpretation of screening mammography after a 6 months training period in a screening setting. Fifteen radiographers received 6 months standardized training with radiologists in the interpretation of screening mammography using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System BI-RADS system. A challenging test set of 110 cases developed by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium was used to evaluate their performance. We estimated sensitivity specificity false positive rates likelihood ratio of a positive test LR and the area under the subject-specific Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curve AUC for diagnostic accuracy. A mathematical model simulating the consequences in costs and performance of two hypothetical scenarios compared to the status quo in which a radiologist reads all screening mammograms was also performed. RESULTS Radiographers sensitivity was comparable to the sensitivity scores achieved by U.S. radiologists who took the test but their false-positive rate was higher. Median sensitivity was 73.3 Interquartile range IQR 46.7-86.7 and the median false positive rate was 49.5 IQR 34.7-57.9 . The median LR was 1.4 IQR 1.3-1.7 and the median AUC was 0.6 IQR 0.6-0.7. A scenario in which a radiographer reads all mammograms first and a radiologist reads only those that were difficult for the radiographer was more cost-effective than a scenario in which either the radiographer or radiologist reads all mammograms. CONCLUSIONS Given the comparable sensitivity achieved by Mexican radiographers and U.S. radiologists on a test set screening mammography interpretation by radiographers appears to be a possible adjunct to radiologists in countries with shortages of radiologists. Further studies are required to assess the effectiveness of different training programs in order to obtain acceptable screening accuracy as well as the best approaches for the use of non-physician readers to interpret screening mammography.",

    "abstract": "Astylus atromaculatus Blanchard is a native beetle of South America that feeds on pollen. During the summer of 2022-2023 in Argentina and Uruguay an explosive infestation of these insects occurred in pastures in which ruminants were grazing. This was believed to be associated with a severe drought which had significantly reduced the flowering of crops. Three farms in Uruguay and one in Argentina were visited to examine the flocks and perform autopsies. Affected sheep had watery diarrhea anorexia depression and ruminal atony. The average morbidity mortality and case fatality rates were 7.5 4.3 and 68 respectively. The main gross findings in all animals were in the jejunum the serosa had multifocal hemorrhages and the mucosa was necrotic and covered by a pseudomembrane. Microscopically the mucosa had partial-to-complete necrosis of the lamina propria as well as loss of villus and crypt epithelium with neutrophilic infiltration. Overlying the necrotic mucosa was a pseudomembrane of fibrin cell debris desquamated epithelial cells degenerate neutrophils and bacteria. Many specimens of A. atromaculatus were in all paddocks in which sheep grazed as well as in the ruminal content of the autopsied animals.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Screening for prostate cancer PCa has dramatically declined in the United States US since the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against routine prostate-specific antigen PSA-based PCa screening in all men in 2012. This led to dramatic reductions in the diagnosis of localized disease across all clinical risk groups. OBJECTIVE In light of decreased PSA screening for men in the US we sought to study trends in newly diagnosed metastatic PCa incidence and how this may vary by race and age. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We analyzed new PCa incidence by stage at diagnosis between 1988 and 2015 within the Cancer Registry of Greater California. We further stratified the patients by age and four major raceethnicity groups Hispanic non-Hispanic white NHW non-Hispanic black NHB and non-Hispanic AsianPacific Islander API. Incidence rates were calculated and compared per 100000 and age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. OUTCOME MEASUREMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The primary outcome was incidence of metastatic PCa at the time of cancer diagnosis. Joinpoint regression program was used to detect changes in incidence and to calculate the average percent change APC over time. All data were analyzed using SEERStat version 8.1.15 and Joinpoint Regression Program version 4.1.0 and a two-sided p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Adjusted rates of metastatic PCa incidence for NHW men significantly increased by 4.3 since 2010 while remaining down NHB Hispanic or level API for other racial groups. Stratified by age incidence of metastatic disease for all races has increased significantly for men aged 64-75 yr since 2008 with an APC of 2.8 while remaining level for other age groups. The limitations of our study include retrospective design and no data on extent of PSA screening in the study cohort. CONCLUSIONS Incidence rates of newly diagnosed metastatic PCa have significantly increased for NHW men and men aged 65-74 yr. PATIENT SUMMARY Prostate-specific antigen screening has declined in the Unites States with a subsequent sharp drop in the incidence of screen-detected localized prostate cancer. The incidence of men presenting with metastatic disease seems to be rising recently and men should continue to discuss the benefits of PSA screening with their primary care doctor.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Altered expression of the CD44 family of cell adhesion molecules has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the gene products of CD44 standard CD44s and several alternatively spliced variants CD44v4 v6 v7 and v9 in adenocarcinoma of the endocervix and to correlate the degree of their expression with disease progression. METHODS Immunohistochemical staining for CD44s and CD44v4 v6 v7 and v9 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded endocervical specimens. Seventeen cases of adenocarcinoma in situ AIS and 22 cases of invasive adenocarcinoma of the endocervix were included in this study and the immunoreactivity was compared with that of normal endocervical epithelium. RESULTS 1 In the normal endocervical mucosa immunoreactivity for CD44s and the splice variants was lacking or was confined to only the basal portion of the glandular epithelium along the basement membrane 2 CD44s was diffusely expressed along the entire cytoplasmic membrane including the luminal surface of the tumorous glands in 94 of AIS and 95 of invasive adenocarcinomas 3 a significantly stronger expression of CD44s was observed in invasive adenocarcinomas than in AIS 4 in contrast to all other splice variants CD44v9 demonstrated an increased expression in nearly all in situ and invasive lesions compared to the normal tissue 5 CD44v4 and v6 were expressed only in a small proportion of invasive adenocarcinomas and were near totally absent in the in situ lesions and 6 CD44 v7 was totally absent in all normal in situ and invasive lesions studied. CONCLUSIONS It appears that neoplastic transformation of endocervical epithelium is associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in the expression of CD44 standard molecule and some CD44 splice variants.",

The monophyly of Pachypleurosauria including all potential Chinese pachypleurosaurs in this study is supported by the rigorous cladistic analysis conducted here. Phylogenetic relationships of Chinese pachypleurosaurs are clarified. Wumengosaurus occupies the most basal position within Pachypleurosauria. Keichousaurus and Dianopachysaurus form the monophyletic Keichousauridae that is the sister group of all European pachypleurosaurs. Our cladistic analysis also supports a previously proposed paleobiogeographic hypothesis of an eastern Tethyan origin of pachypleurosaurs and their migration into the western Tethyan faunal province. The existence of a long ghost lineage as required by the paleobiogeographic hypothesis is greatly shortened by the discovery of Dianopachysaurus. 2011 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.",

    "abstract": "Power minimization has become a primary concern in microprocessor design. In recent years many circuit and micro-architectural innovations have been proposed to reduce power in many individual processor units. However many of these prior efforts have concentrated on the approaches which require considerable redesign and verification efforts. Also it has not been investigated whether these techniques can be combined. Therefore a challenge is to find a centralized and simple algorithm which can address power issues for more than one unit and ultimately the entire chip and comes with the least amount of redesign and verification efforts the lowest possible design risk and the least hardware overhead. This paper proposes such a centralized approach that attempts to simultaneously reduce power in processor units with highest dissipation reorder buffer instruction queue loadstore queue and register files. It is based on an observation that utilization for the aforementioned units varies significantly during cache miss period. Therefore we propose to dynamically adjust the size and thus power dissipation of these resources during such periods. Circuit level modifications required for such resource adaptation are presented. Simulation results show a substantial power reduction at the cost of a negligible performance impact and a small hardware overhead. 2011 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To evaluate survival after detection of recurrent cervical cancer by FDG-PET in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. METHODS This is a prospective registry study of 103 patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for advanced cervical cancer who demonstrated no abnormal FDG uptake a complete metabolic response CMR on their 3-month posttherapy FDG-PET. Their median age was 48 years range 26-84. The clinical stages were Ib in 38 IIa in 1 IIb in 39 and IIIb in 25. All patients underwent subsequent surveillance FDG-PET. Patients were grouped according to symptom status at the time of the surveillance FDG-PET. Recurrence sites and survival data were analyzed. RESULTS The median time from the 3-month posttherapy FDG-PET to the first surveillance FDG-PET was 13 months. 25 patients 25103 24 were symptomatic at the time of surveillance FDG-PET and 21 of these had FDG-PET findings indicative of recurrence. 78 patients 78103 76 were asymptomatic and 9 of these had tumor recurrence detected by PET. All recurrences were confirmed by biopsy or radiologic progression. The recurrences in the 21 symptomatic patients were loco regional in 4 and distant in 17. The 9 asymptomatic patients had isolated loco regional disease in 8 and distant disease in 1. All patients received treatment for recurrence. The three-year cause-specific survival for symptomatic recurrences was 19 versus 59 for asymptomatic recurrences p0.09. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance FDG-PET can detect asymptomatic recurrent disease that is potentially amenable to salvage therapy. Prospective investigation of surveillance PET is warranted.",

The known side effects of idelalisib include severe diarrhea and colitis. Here we report the histologic findings in idelalisib-associated enterocolitis in 11 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or follicular lymphoma receiving idelalisib over a 5-year period 2011 to 2015 at our institution. All 11 patients were receiving idelalisib and underwent colonoscopy for the evaluation of diarrhea. None of the patients had previously received a stem cell transplant. Histologically the colon biopsies in all 11 cases showed some degree of apoptosis within crypts with 5 cases showing moderate to severe apoptosis involving the majority of the crypts with loss of goblet cells. No viral inclusions were seen in any case and immunohistochemical stains for cytomegalovirus performed in 911 cases were negative. All cases showed at least focal acute cryptitis and 8 of these cases showed mild architectural distortion. Increased inflammation within the lamina propria was seen in 7 cases and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes within crypts was seen in 8 cases the lymphocytes were mostly T cells with a predominance of CD8 T cells with the majority expressing the T-cell receptor. Diagnoses of graft-versus-host disease autoimmune enteropathy infectious enterocolitis and although thought to be less likely inflammatory bowel disease were considered in each case. The presence of numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes in addition to severe villous blunting and apoptosis in the small intestinal biopsies from a subset of these patients additionally raised the possibility of autoimmune enteropathy common variable immunodeficiency or less likely celiac disease. Awareness of the histologic features of idelalisib-associated enterocolitis is important to distinguish it from potential mimics particularly graft-versus-host disease autoimmune enteropathy and cytomegalovirusinfectious enterocolitis.",

    "abstract": "The competitive sorption behaviors of 12-DCB in binary solute systems in four natural sorbents having natural organic matter NOM matrixes of different physicochemical characters were investigated in batch reactors. Specifically the study focused on investigating how the extent of 12-DCB competitive sorption depends on i the rigidity of NOM matrixes as assessed by the efficiency of chemical oxidation and ii the closeness of competitor structure to that of the primary solute. The chemical oxidation and elemental composition results suggest that the shale NOM is the most reduced and condensed the peat was the most oxidized and amorphous and two surface soils had intermediate NOM structures. Four chlorinated benzenes and phenanthrene were used as competing solutes. All five chemicals exhibited competition against 12-DCB in all sorbents including the peat but the extent of competition varied significantly. Little difference in the extent of competition with 12-DCB was observed for the various chlorinated benzenes even though some were liquids and some were solids at the experimental temperature. All of the chlorobenzenes were more effective competitors than phenanthrene. The shale showed markedly different competition features from the other sorbents with a much smaller competitive effect at a given sorbed volume of competitor. However normalizing sorbed competitor volumes by the capacity of the adsorption domain in the Polanyi-Manes single-solute partition-adsorption model V0 produced qualitatively similar competitive behavior for each solute displacement of 12-DCB increased with increasing sorbed competitor volumes up to V0 and little additional competition occurred beyond that point. The extent of competition was positively correlated with the maximum adsorption capacity and the fraction of hard and soot carbon contents as assessed by chemical and thermal oxidation methods. These findings indicate that competition is associated with voids in the NOM structure that these voids are likely present within the condensed hard plus soot carbon domain and therefore that diagenetic alteration of NOM plays a central role in determining competitive sorption characteristics for hydrophobic contaminants.",

    "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis is thought to be an adaptation to warm environments involving complex changes in the expression of genes governing photosynthesis intermediary metabolism and leaf anatomy and histology. Such complexity should be difficult to evolve yet the pathway has arisen multiple times in the history of the flowering plants and at least four times in the grass family alone. We have used immunolocalization techniques to compare photosynthetic gene expression across all four origins to determine which genetic changes occur in parallel and which are unique to a particular lineage. The only gene expression patterns common to all origins of the pathway are up regulation of PEP carboxylase and down regulation of RuBisCO in mesophyll cells. Both NAD-malic enzyme and NADP-malic enzyme are expressed in bundle sheaths. Expression patterns of light harvesting chlorophyll alb binding proteins and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase appear to be lineage specific and may be localized to bundle sheaths or to mesophyll or expressed throughout the photosynthetic tissue of the leaf. We suggest that future studies of parallel origin of the C4 pathway concentrate on regulation of the two carboxylases as well as the increased density of vascular tissue which is the only histological characteristic common to all origins of the pathway.",

The AWGR combined with fast tunable lasers is being envisioned as one of the mainstream choices for intra-datacenter networks. Congestion control with fulfilling the deadline requirements of flows within the datacenter network influences the network performance largely. In this paper we propose DEER a central arbitration algorithm that enables flexible optical timeslot assignment for deadline-driven bursting traffic in an AWGR-based optical datacenter network realizing contention-free and fulfilling the deadline requirements as much as possible. The proposed algorithm takes various traffic volumes and deadlines into account and includes a heuristic algorithm making global decisions for all ToR switches. Numerical results indicate that DEER realizes contention-free transmission and decreases the deadline missing rate by 41.48 versus RRB and 26.29 versus LQF.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND There is a need for refined risk stratification of sudden cardiac death and prediction of ventricular arrhythmias to correctly identify patients who are expected to benefit the most from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ICD therapy. METHODS We conducted a registry-based retrospective observational study on patients with either ischemic ICMP or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy NICMP treated with ICD between 2002 and 2013 at a tertiary referral center. We evaluated 3 vectorcardiography VCG indices spatial QRS-T angle QRS vector magnitude QRSvm and T-wave vector magnitude Twvm and their association with all-cause mortality and ventricular arrhythmias. The VCG indices were automatically computed from resting 12-lead electrocardiograms before ICD implantation. RESULTS 178 patients were included in the study 53.4 had ICMP 79.2 were male and mean ejection fraction was 27.4. During the follow-up median 89 months 40 patients 23 died 31 had appropriate ICD therapy. In multivariate analysis with dichotomized variables QRS-T angle 152 and Twvm 0.38 mV were significantly associated with increased mortality HR 2.64 95 CI 1.14-6.12 p 0.02 and HR 5.30 95 CI 2.31-12.11 p 0.001 respectively. QRSvm 1.54 mV was borderline significant with mortality outcome p 0.10. The composite score of all 3 VCG indices a score of 3 conferred an increased risk of mortality including heart failure mortality in multivariate analysis HR 13.80 95 CI 3.44-55.39 p 0.001. CONCLUSION The spatial QRS-T angle and Twvm are emerging VCG indices which are independently associated with mortality in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction due to ICMP or NICMP. Using a composite score of all 3 vector indices a maximum score was associated with poor long-term survival.",

Recently Arkani-Hamed Bourjaily Cachazo and Trnka conjectured the same singularity properties hold to all loop orders in the nonplanar sector as well. Here we conjecture that to all loop orders these constraints give us the key integrand level analytic information contained in dual conformal symmetry. We also conjecture that to all loop orders while Formula presented. supergravity has poles at infinity at least at four points it has only logarithmic singularities at finite locations. We provide nontrivial evidence for these conjectures. For the three-loop four-point Formula presented. super-Yang-Mills amplitude we explicitly construct a complete basis of diagram integrands that has only logarithmic singularities and no poles at infinity. We then express the complete amplitude in terms of the basis diagrams with the coefficients determined by unitarity. We also give examples at three loops showing how to make the logarithmic singularity properties manifest via d log forms. We give additional evidence at four and five loops supporting the nonplanar logarithmic singularity conjecture. Furthermore we present a variety of examples illustrating that these constraints are more restrictive than dual conformal symmetry. Our investigations show that the singularity structures of planar and nonplanar integrands in Formula presented. super-Yang-Mills are strikingly similar. While it is not clear how to extend either dual conformal symmetry or a dual formulation to the nonplanar sector these results suggest that related concepts might exist and await discovery. Finally we describe the singularity structure of Formula presented. supergravity at three loops and beyond.",

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of sotalol on echocardiographic indices of ventricular systolic function in dogs with ventricular arrhythmias. ANIMALS Thirty-five client-owned dogs with ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS Dogs with ventricular arrhythmias n 27 had an echocardiogram and 5-minute ECG performed at baseline and 2-4 hours post-sotalol 2-2.5 mgkg PO once. Eight additional dogs underwent the same protocol but did not receive sotalol within-day variability controls. Left ventricular LV internal dimension at end-systole normalized to bodyweight LVIDs_N LV ejection fraction LV EF LV shortening area LV fractional shortening tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion TAPSE and right ventricular systolic myocardial velocity were evaluated as indices of systolic function. RESULTS All indices except TAPSE had mild decreases in systolic function post-sotalol all P .0007 compared with baseline but only the percent change in LVIDs_N and LV EF were significantly P .0079 different from the percent change of the same indices in control dogs. Sinus heart rate ventricular premature complexes5-minutes and arrhythmia grade also were decreased post-sotalol all P .01 compared with baseline when assessed by a 5-minutes ECG. No dog experienced an adverse event post-sotalol including dogs with systolic dysfunction or atrial enlargement.

    "abstract": "Legacy IP routing restricts the efficacy of traffic engineering solutions. This restriction stems from the constraint that traffic at a node must be uniformly split across all next-hop nodes corresponding to equal cost shortest path to a destination. Proposals that alleviate this constraint either completely overhaul legacy IP routing or introduce complex control andor forwarding plane components. This additional complexity departs from the elegant simplicity of legacy routing protocols where statically optimized link weights embed all traffic engineering semantics. We present Interface Split Routing ISR which retains the basic forwarding and control mechanism of legacy IP routing. Furthermore a set of link weights embed all traffic engineering semantics in ISR. However ISR makes possible finer-grained traffic engineering by configuring independent sets of next-hops to a destination at each incoming interface. This lends itself well to modern router architectures where each incoming interface has its own forwarding table. Consequently at the aggregated node level traffic to a particular destination may be non-uniformly distributed across next-hop nodes. Hence ISR allows additional flexibility in routing traffic as compared to default IP routing while retaining its simplicity. We conduct simulation studies on representative ISP topologies to compare ISR with traditional link-weight-optimized routing. ISR reduces the difference between optimal routing and weight-optimized routing by 50. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A central observation is that the renormalized gauge coupling can be extended to a real vector superfield thereby including soft breaking effects in the gauge sector. We explain the relation between this vector superfield coupling and the holomorphic gauge coupling which is a chiral superfield running only at 1 loop. We consider these issues for a number of regulators including dimensional reduction. With this method the renormalization group equations for soft supersymmetry breaking terms are directly related to supersymmetric beta functions and anomalous dimensions to all orders in perturbation theory. However the real power of the formalism lies in computing finite soft breaking effects corresponding to high-loop component calculations. We prove that the gaugino mass in gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking is screened from strong interactions in the messenger sector. We present the complete next-to-leading calculation of gaugino masses 2 loops and sfermion masses 3 loops in minimal gauge mediation and several other calculations of phenomenological relevance.",

Beyond ultrasound computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance MR imaging that are conventionally used for anatomical imaging 18FFDG imaging and its hybrid further development as PETCT has become a crucial tool due of its ability to combine functional metabolic and anatomic information and the ability to image the entire whole body in a single examination. Since the introduction of integrated hybrid PETCT systems into clinical practice the accurate analysis of the images has detected a number of limitations and pitfalls. The purpose of this review was to describe in detail the different pitfalls related to the use of 18FFDG PETCT in the gynecological malignancies providing imaging examples and discussing possible ways to avoid misinterpretations.",

All species had a peak of JHE at or near the time of wandering. The peak activity at this time ranged from 0.8 to 388 nmoles JH III cleavedminml. All species except J. coenia had a second peak of JHE during the late prepupal stage. The height of the second peak ranged from 0.4 to 98.4 nmolesminml. However there was no apparent correlation between size of the first and second JHE activity peaks for the lepidopteran species examined. There was an apparent relationship between the height of the first and second JHE peaks and reports on titer of JH just prior to these peaks.

Three-dimensional movies depicting the microvascular response to neuronal activation were created for the first time. An increase in the attenuation coefficient during activation was identified and a simple normalization procedure was proposed to correct for it. This procedure was applied to determine compartment-resolved backscattering changes caused by dRBC content changes during functional activation. Increases in dRBC content were observed in all vascular compartments arterial arteriolar capillary and venular with the largest responses found in the arterial and arteriolar compartments. dRBC content increased with dilation in arteries but with barely detectable dilation in veins. dRBC content increased in capillaries without significant all or none capillary recruitment.",

This requires complex large studies to measure how plant genotypes simultaneously interact with a diverse array of environmental stimuli. Successful interpretation of the results from these studies requires us to transition away from the traditional standard of conducting an array of pairwise t tests toward more general linear modeling structures such as those provided by the extendable ANOVA framework. In this Perspective we present arguments for making this transition and illustrate how it will help to avoid incorrect conclusions in factorial interaction studies genotype genotype genotype treatment and treatment treatment or higher levels of interaction that are becoming more prevalent in this new era of plant biology.",

However a number researchers have recently pointed out that ad-supported free apps involve hidden costs to the users. Costs are primarily associated with the loss of privacy due to personal data collection using data from the mobile data quota and draining of smartphone battery. The alternative proposals for the problem do not address all of these issues. We propose a novel ads delivery architecture which addresses all these issues by extending the users personal domain to the cloud through personal cloudlets. Personal cloudlets preserve user privacy by only releasing high level user information to the ad network reduce energy consumption by performing the computations communications and storage in the cloud and minimize the bandwidth usage by passing only selected information between personal cloudlet and the smartphone. Furthermore the proposed architecture provides a number of incentives for ad networks to use the architecture. 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery Inc. ACM.",

The diversity of natural animal reservoirs for members of the genera Bartonella and Brucella are just now becoming fully defined and appreciated and are likely all around us. Brucella spp. and Francisella spp. are well-established as agents that warrant special attention and focus because of their potential for misuse and intentional release in acts of bioterrorism or biowarfare.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Flexion of one elbow is essential to enable children with arthrogryposis to achieve independent function such as self-feeding and self-care of the face and hair. We analyzed the outcomes of posterior elbow capsulotomy with triceps lengthening for the treatment of elbow extension contractures in a series of children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. METHODS The medical records of all children with arthrogryposis who had been followed for a minimum of two years after treatment with elbow capsulotomy and triceps lengthening were retrospectively reviewed. The postoperative range of motion and ability to reach the mouth were compared with the preoperative status. RESULTS Posterior capsulotomy with triceps lengthening was performed in twenty-nine elbows of twenty-three children with an average age of thirty-five months range seven months to thirteen years. The average duration of follow-up was 5.4 years. The arc of motion of all twenty-nine elbows improved from an average of 32 degrees range 0 degrees to 75 degrees preoperatively to an average of 66 degrees range 10 degrees to 125 degrees at the time of final follow-up. All children were able to reach the mouth using passive assistance e.g. table-push trunk-sway and cross-arm techniques and twenty-two children were able to feed themselves independently. No child underwent subsequent tendon transfer surgery. CONCLUSIONS Elbow capsulotomy with triceps lengthening successfully increases passive elbow flexion and the arc of elbow motion of children with arthrogryposis enabling hand-to-mouth activities. In contrast to studies in which tendon transfer surgery was used to increase elbow flexion none of the children in this series underwent subsequent tendon transfer surgery.",

    "abstract": "Host defense against the parasite Toxoplasma gondii requires the cytokine interferon-gamma IFN. However Toxoplasma inhibits the host cell transcriptional response to IFN which is thought to allow the parasite to establish a chronic infection. It is not known whether all strains of Toxoplasma block IFN-responsive transcription equally and whether this inhibition occurs solely through the modulation of STAT1 activity or whether other transcription factors are involved. We find that strains from three North AmericanEuropean clonal lineages of Toxoplasma types I II and III can differentially modulate specific aspects of IFN signaling through the polymorphic effector proteins ROP16 and GRA15. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation is activated in the absence of IFN by the Toxoplasma kinase ROP16 but this ROP16-activated STAT1 is not transcriptionally active. Many genes induced by STAT1 can also be controlled by other transcription factors and therefore using these genes as specific readouts to determine Toxoplasma inhibition of STAT1 activity might be inappropriate. Indeed GRA15 and ROP16 modulate the expression of subsets of IFN responsive genes through activation of the NF-BIRF1 and STAT36 transcription factors respectively. However using a stable STAT1-specific reporter cell line we show that strains from the type I II and III clonal lineages equally inhibit STAT1 transcriptional activity. Furthermore all three of the clonal lineages significantly inhibit global IFN induced gene expression.",

Here we propose a soft theorem satisfied by loop integrands with any number of loops and legs. This requires a generalization of NLSM integrands to an off shell framework with certain deformed kinematics. Defining an algebraic soft limit we identify a simple nonvanishing soft behavior of integrands which we call the algebraic soft theorem. We find that the proposed soft theorem is satisfied by the surfaceintegrand of Arkani-Hamed and Figueiredo arXiv2403.04826 which is obtained from the shifted Tr3 surfacehedron integrand. Finally we derive an on shell version of the algebraic soft theorem that takes an interesting form in terms of self-energy factors and lower-loop integrands in a mixed theory of pions and scalars.",

We undertook surgical repair of this lesion in the neonatal period and report on our midterm results. METHODS Three neonates with tricuspid insufficiency and 1 infant with mitral insufficiency all due to papillary muscle or chordal rupture underwent surgical repair with artificial chordal replacement and a modification of the de Vega annuloplasty technique that allowed external adjustment of the annulus size under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS All patients recovered well from the operation. There have been no late deaths and no valve-related complications. On discharge all 3 patients had evidence of trace to mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation. At a median follow-up of 33 months range 7 to 50 123 patient-months all 4 patients are growing normally. Three patients have had no change in the degree of tricuspid or mitral regurgitation. One patient required reoperation at 54 months postoperatively for acute mitral insufficiency secondary to separation of an artificial chorda from the ventricular wall. CONCLUSIONS Surgical repair of critical neonatal tricuspid and mitral insufficiency associated with papillary muscle or chordal rupture is feasible and can result in good early and midterm results. Our modification of the De Vega annuloplasty technique with the ability to externally adjust the size of the annulus under echocardiographic guidance may improve the accuracy of the repair in the neonate.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Except for low thiamin content little is known about vitamins or macronutrients in milk from Cambodian mothers and associations among milk nutrients. OBJECTIVES We measured fat-soluble vitamins FSVs and water-soluble vitamins WSVs and macronutrients and explored internutrient associations in milk from Cambodian mothers. METHODS Milk from women aged 18-45 y 3-27 wk postpartum n 68 who participated in a thiamin-fortification trial were analyzed for vitamins B-2 riboflavin FAD B-3 nicotinamide B-5 B-6 pyridoxal pyridoxine B-7 B-12 A E -tocopherol and -tocopherol -TPH carotenoids carbohydrate CHO fat and protein. Milk vitamin B-1 thiamin thiamin monophosphate TMP thiamin pyrophosphate TPP was previously assessed for fortification effects. Milk nutrient concentrations were compared with the Adequate Intake AI values for infants aged 0-6 mo. Pearson correlation was used to examine internutrient associations after excluding nutrients affected by fortification. RESULTS Fortification increased thiamin and B-1 and decreased -TPH. Less than 40 of milk samples met the AIs for all vitamins and 10 samples did not reach any AI values for the analyzed nutrients. CHO fat and energy values were met in 1.5-11.8 and protein in 48.5 of the samples. Whereas fat protein and energy were related all r 0.5 P 0.001 and associated with FSVs and WSVs CHO correlated only with some WSVs. TPP was not correlated with B-1 vitamers but with other WSVs r 0.28-0.58 P 0.019. All FSVs except -carotene were correlated with each other r 0.42-0.98 P 0.002. TPP FAD B-2 and B-3 were associated with almost all FSVs r 0.24-0.63 P 0.044. CONCLUSIONS Cambodian women might not provide sufficient nutrients to their exclusively breastfeeding infants. Besides thiamin all other vitamins measured were much lower than the AI. There were many strong correlations among macronutrients and vitamins the extent to which these are explained by maternal diet milk volume maternal physiology or genetics requires additional exploration.",

    "abstract": "Spatially explicit capture-recapture SCR approaches using noninvasive fecal DNA fDNA are applied increasingly to obtain statistically robust abundance estimates for various wildlife species. But SCR has not been widely used for more gregarious species such as elk Cervus canadensis. Because of their heterogeneous use of the landscape and grouping behavior elk present novel challenges to sampling efficiency and statistical assumptions. We employed fDNA SCR and a stratified random sampling approach to estimate abundance in 3 northern California tule elk C. c. nannodes populations concurrent with global positioning system GPS-telemetry monitoring of 66 elk 32 male 34 female in Colusa and Lake counties California USA during JuneAugust 20172019. We collected 1616 fecal pellet groups from the 3 populations resulting in 1002 fDNA genotypes 19 microsatellite loci 1 sex marker of 425 unique individuals. Based on SCR estimates from a model incorporating both sexes elk density ranged from 0.31 95 CI 0.170.55 elkkm2 to 1.7 95 CI 1.32.2 elkkm2 translating approximately to 650 individuals evenly split between sexes among the 3 populations. Independent telemetry data from concurrently tracked individuals indicated that activity centers of females but not males were clustered on the landscape. This finding was corroborated using fDNA to infer activity centers. Comparison of SCR estimates to non-spatial estimates using physically captured individuals suggested that combined-sex SCR models were robust to spatial clustering of females in all 3 populations. Additionally single-sex models were robust to female clustering in the 2 populations with multiple female groups but not in Lake Pillsbury where all females effectively shared a single activity center. In that case the estimate of female abundance was deemed an overestimate. Thus results indicate that SCR was robust to gregariousness in elk in all but the most extreme cases of clustering single-sex female estimation when all individuals share a single activity center and that the inclusion of both sexes was sufficient to offset biases stemming from aggregation of females in all cases. Altogether our findings suggest that SCR methods can be gainfully applied to socially gregarious ungulates such as elk.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Hunterian ligation of the internal carotid artery ICA is an accepted treatment for inoperable carotid aneurysms. Preliminary extracranial-intracranial EC-IC bypass surgery is required in some patients. The reported incidence of thromboembolic and ischemic complications remains significant for these patients despite a variety of advocated management strategies. We present our treatment paradigm. METHODS Between April 1992 and March 1997 nine patients with inoperable ICA aneurysms were treated using EC-IC bypass surgery and then permanent endovascular ICA occlusion. All of the patients except one had been selected for bypass surgery on the basis of failing results of the ICA test occlusion with hypotensive challenge. ICA occlusion was performed by endovascular means and was delayed after bypass surgery was performed by a mean of 6 days range 2-20 d. All patients were managed in the intensive care unit after ICA occlusion. RESULTS Clinical improvement was noted in all patients mean follow-up 21 mo range 3-42 mo. There were no major complications. Aneurysmal thrombosis was confirmed in all patients. Although ICA occlusion was delayed after bypass surgery only one bypass was noted to be occluded. The occluded bypass occurred in a patient who subsequently underwent successful ICA occlusion. This patient was thought to have been improperly selected for bypass surgery. CONCLUSION Certain carotid aneurysms can be effectively managed with hunterian ICA ligation. After preliminary identification of patients with borderline cerebrovascular reserve as candidates for EC-IC bypass surgery close attention to the following points may help enhance clinical outcome 1 excellence in surgical technique for EC-IC bypass surgery 2 occlusion of the parent vessel as close to the aneurysm neck as possible by endovascular means and 3 judicious postoperative combination of anticoagulation fluid and pressure management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. The higher phylogeny of the Formicidae was analysed using 68 characters and 19 taxa the 14 currently recognized ant subfamilies plus 5 potentially critical infrasubfamilial taxa. The results justified the recognition of 3 additional subfamilies Aenictogitoninae Ashmead new status Apomyrminae Dlussky Fedoseeva new status and Leptanilloidinae Bolton new subfamily. A second analysis on these better delimited 17 subfamilies resulted in 24 equally most parsimonious trees. All trees showed a basal division of extant Formicidae into two groups the first containing Myrmicinae Pseudomyrmecinae Nothomyrmeciinae Myrmeciinae Formicinae Dolichoderinae Aneuretinae and the second the remaining subfamilies. Clades appearing within these groups included the Cerapachyinae plus army ants the Nothomyrmeciinae plus Myrmeciinae the formicoid subfamilies Aneuretinae Dolichoderinae Formicinae and the Old World army ants Aenictinae Aenictogitoninae Doryline but relationships within the last two groups were not resolved and the relative positions of the Apomyrminae Leptanillinae and Ponerinae remained ambiguous. Moreover a bootstrap analysis produced a consensus tree in which all branches were represented in proportions much lower than 95. A reconstruction of the ground plan of the Formicidae indicated that the most specialized of all recent ants are the members of the subfamily Dorylinae and the least specialized ones are the monotypic Apomyrminae.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To examine the impact of surgical labyrinthectomy on quality of life of Mnires disease patients. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SETTING Otology subspecialty referral center. PATIENTS All patients with Mnires disease who underwent surgical labyrinthectomy between 1998 and 2004 were selected. Fifty-three patients satisfied inclusion criteria. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 44 patients. INTERVENTIONS The Mnires Disease Outcomes Questionnaire is a disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. It was used to assess the quality of life of patients before and after surgical labyrinthectomy. The questionnaire encompasses physical mental and social well-being domains of quality of life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Change in total quality-of-life score was used to assess the overall impact of surgical labyrinthectomy on subjective patient outcome. Individual quality-of-life domains were also assessed. RESULTS Forty-three of 44 respondents 98 had improvement in total score after surgery. The one patient who demonstrated deterioration developed latent contralateral disease. Average preoperative and postoperative scores were 34 - 14 and 67 - 15 respectively p 0.001. All questions showed significant improvement with surgery p 0.001 except questions pertaining to memory no change and hearing loss nonsignificant decrease in score. CONCLUSION This study comprises the first patient-directed assessment of quality-of-life outcomes in Mnires disease patients after labyrinthectomy. Despite the disadvantage of hearing loss patients consistently reported significant improvement in all quality-of-life domains and do not report a significant loss of quality of life in terms of their hearing loss. Surgical labyrinthectomy remains a highly effective treatment for Mnires disease patients.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Network analysis allows us to identify the most interconnected i.e. central symptoms and multiple authors have suggested that these symptoms might be important treatment targets. This is because change in central symptoms relative to others should have greater impact on change in all other symptoms. It has been argued that networks derived from cross-sectional data may help identify such important symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in social anxiety disorder. METHOD We first estimated a state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation network based on participants with social anxiety disorder n 910 to determine which symptoms were more central. Next we tested whether change in these central symptoms were indeed more related to overall symptom change in a separate dataset of participants with social anxiety disorder who underwent a variety of treatments n 244. We also tested whether relatively superficial item properties infrequency of endorsement and variance of items might account for any effects shown for central symptoms. RESULTS Centrality indices successfully predicted how strongly changes in items correlated with change in the remainder of the items. Findings were limited to the measure used in the network and did not generalize to three other measures related to social anxiety severity. In contrast infrequency of endorsement showed associations across all measures. CONCLUSIONS The transfer of recently published results from cross-sectional network analyses to treatment data is unlikely to be straightforward.

    "abstract": "Three pairs of parental rho and established mitochondrial DNA depleted rho0 cells derived from bone lung and muscle were used to verify the influence of the nuclear background and the lack of efficient mitochondrial respiratory chain on antioxidant defences and homeostasis of intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS. Mitochondrial DNA depletion significantly lowered glutathione reductase activity glutathione GSH content and consistently altered the GSH2 oxidized glutathione ratio in all of the rho0 cell lines albeit to differing extents indicating the most oxidized redox state in bone rho0 cells. Activity as well as gene expression and protein content of superoxide dismutase showed a decrease in bone and muscle rho0 cell lines but not in lung rho0 cells. GSH peroxidase activity was four times higher in all three rho0 cell lines in comparison to the parental rho suggesting that this may be a necessary adaptation for survival without a functional respiratory chain. Taken together these data suggest that the lack of respiratory chain prompts the cells to reduce their need for antioxidant defences in a tissue-specific manner exposing them to a major risk of oxidative injury. In fact bone-derived rho0 cells displayed the highest steady-state level of intracellular ROS measured directly by 27-dichlorofluorescin or indirectly by aconitase activity compared to all the other rho and rho0 cells both in the presence or absence of glucose. Analysis of mitochondrial and cytosoliciron regulatory protein-1 aconitase indicated that most ROS of bone rho0 cells originate from sources other than mitochondria.",

External beam radiation therapy EBRT for prostate cancer treatment has been associated with later development of bladder cancer and worse bladder cancer features. OBJECTIVE We sought to provide an updated comparison of the long-term risk of bladder cancer after different localized prostate cancer treatments. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER cancer registry we compared an age-matched subset of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy RP with those who underwent EBRT brachytherapy BT EBRT BT and RP followed by EBRT RPtoEBRT between 2000 and 2018. Our final cohort included 261 609 patients with a median follow-up of 11.6 yr. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Our primary outcomes were time to bladder cancer diagnosis muscle-invasive bladder cancer diagnosis and bladder cancer death. We used cause-specific hazard models considering death as a competing event. A similar analysis was performed on lung cancer as a surrogate marker for smoking. We also compared proportions of variant histology high-grade and invasive disease among bladder cancers that occurred after radiation versus RP using chi-square testing. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS All radiation groups were associated with bladder cancer diagnosis hazard ratios HRs were 1.72 1.85 1.80 and 1.53 for EBRT BT EBRT BT and RPtoEBRT respectively using RP as a referent all p 0.001. HRs for bladder cancer death were even higher 2.39 2.57 and 3.02 for EBRT BT and EBRT BT respectively all p 0.001 except for RPtoEBRT HR 1.43 p 0.28. Lung cancer diagnosis was also associated with radiation but at lower HRs-1.63 1.32 1.42 and 1.30 for EBRT BT EBRT BT and RPtoEBRT respectively all p 0.001. There were a higher proportion of T2 T3 and sarcomatoid variant bladder cancers after radiation all p 0.01 CONCLUSIONS The risk of developing and dying from bladder cancer is increased in patients treated with radiation compared with those treated with RP. The risk was similar for BT and EBRT. Bladder cancers after radiation are more likely to be sarcomatoid variant and present as muscle invasive. PATIENT SUMMARY We observed the rates of bladder cancer after patients had undergone surgery or radiation for prostate cancer and found higher rates of bladder cancer after radiation. We also observed that bladder cancers that occur after radiation tend to be more aggressive.",

Additional comparisons were made for people who passed or failed the Test of Memory Malingering TOMM to determine effects of effort on scores generated by either scoring system. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed that all seven comparisons were significantly different for the full sample p or 0.001. The NDS indicated greater levels of impairment compared to DS across all variables. These findings were also obtained when considering effort though TOMM failure was related to non-significant differences for two variables. These findings suggest that the two scoring systems are not equivalent with Heaton et al.s DS resulting in consistently higher identification rates of normal brain functioning compared to those generated from Reitan and Wolfsons NDS system.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to assess the microbiological safety of popular recreational swimming sites in Central California. Water samples were collected from eleven monitoring sites across the lower reaches of two watersheds for two consecutive swimming seasons 2012-2013 and levels of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms were determined. Data on ambient weather and water chemistry were collected for analyzing their associations with microorganisms in water. All water samples were positive for indicator E. coli with mean concentrations per site ranging from 3.07 to 216.11 MPN100 ml in 2012 and 13.4 to 226.97 MPN100 ml in 2013. Mean E. coli concentrations in 27 and 36 samplings sites exceeded the EPA 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria recommended mean concentration of 126 CFU100 ml of E. coli in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in all water samples from all sampling sites with an overall prevalence of 50 and mean concentrations of 0.08 oocystsl in 2012 and 0.19 oocystsl in 2013. Giardia spp. cysts were detected at eight sites with an overall prevalence of 28.8 and mean concentration of 0.2 cystsl in both years. The majority of the detected Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts appeared damaged under microscopy. E. coli O157H7 was detected in 9 of water samples with positive samples limited to three sites. Salmonella spp. were detected in all but one site across the two years with mean concentrations of 0.94 MPNl in 2012 and 1.85 MPNl in 2013. Cryptosporidium spp. oocyst concentrations were negatively associated with 30-day mean wind speed and cumulative precipitation and dissolved oxygen in water. Giardia spp. cyst concentrations were positively associated with turbidity and pH of water and negatively associated with E. coli concentrations and 24-h mean air temperature. Salmonella spp. concentrations were positively associated with 30-day mean air temperature. The occurrence of E. coli O157H7 was positively associated with previous 30-day cumulative precipitation.",

Elucidating the neurobiological patterns that specifically characterize SI and NSSI in adolescents is needed to inform the use of these markers in intervention studies and to develop brain-based treatment targets. Here we clinically assessed 70 adolescents-49 adolescents with depression and 21 healthy controls-to determine SI and NSSI history. Twenty-eight of the depressed adolescents had a history of SI and 29 had a history of NSSI 20 overlapping. All participants underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. We compared groups in network coherence of subdivisions of the central executive network CEN default mode network DMN and salience network SN. We also examined group differences in between-network connectivity and explored brain-behavior correlations. Depressed adolescents with SI and with NSSI had lower coherence in the ventral DMN compared to those without SI or NSSI respectively and healthy controls all ps 0.043 uncorrected. Depressed adolescents with NSSI had lower coherence in the anterior DMN and in insula-SN all ps 0.030 uncorrected and higher CEN-DMN connectivity compared to those without NSSI and healthy controls all ps 0.030 uncorrected. Lower network coherence in all DMN subnetworks and insula-SN were associated with higher past-month SI and NSSI all ps 0.001 uncorrected. Thus in our sample both SI and NSSI are related to brain networks associated with difficulties in self-referential processing and future planning while NSSI specifically is related to brain networks associated with disruptions in interoceptive awareness.",

During a median follow-up of 7.8 years 725 deaths occurred. Baseline questionnaires assessed moderate and vigorous recreational physical activity and BMI prior to diagnosis. Associations with all-cause mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for established prognostic factors. Compared with no physical activity any recreational activity during the 3 years prior to diagnosis was associated with a 34 lower risk of death hazard ratio HR 0.66 95 confidence interval CI 0.51-0.85 for women with estrogen receptor ER-positive tumors but not those with ER-negative tumors this association did not appear to differ by raceethnicity or BMI. Lifetime physical activity was not associated with all-cause mortality. BMI was positively associated with all-cause mortality for women diagnosed at age or 50 years with ER-positive tumors compared with normal-weight women HR for overweight 1.39 95 CI 0.90-2.15 HR for obese 1.77 95 CI 1.11-2.82.

In this work we improve the transmission performance of multicast aiming at satisfying all the users with a trans-layer design scheme. We first establish a practical system model for trans-layer multicast networks with transport blocks TBs as the transmission units. Focusing on the optimization of ROHC we formulate a novel trans-layer control framework in terms of partially observable Markov decision process POMDP to maximize the total number of successfully received payload bits among all users in one Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service MBMS. To address the complexity issue of the rigorous POMDP formulation we further develop an Instantaneous Marginal Belief IMB policy algorithm to handle multiple-user.

    "abstract": "Social relationships profoundly impact health in social species. Much of what we know regarding the impact of affiliative social relationships on health in nonhuman primates NHPs has focused on the structure of connections or the quality of relationships. These relationships are often quantified by comparing different types of affiliative behaviors e.g. contact sitting grooming proximity or pooling affiliative behaviors into an overall measure of affiliation. However it is unclear how the breadth of affiliative behaviors e.g. how many different types or which ones a dyad engages in impact health and fitness outcomes. We used a novel social network approach to quantify the breadth of affiliative relationships based on two behaviors grooming and sitting in contact. Dyadic relationships were filtered into separate networks depending on whether the pair engaged in multiple affiliative behaviors multiplex networks or just one uniplex networks. Typically in social network analysis the edges in the network represent the presence of a single behavior e.g. grooming regardless of the presence or absence of other behaviors e.g. contact sitting proximity. Therefore to validate this method we first compared the overall structure of the standard network for each affiliative behavior all grooming interactions regardless of contact sitting and all contact sitting interactions regardless of grooming. We then similarly compared the structure of our filtered multiplex vs. uniplex networks. Results indicated that multiplex networks were more modular reciprocal and kin-based while connections in uniplex networks were more strongly associated with social status. These differences were not replicated when comparing networks based on a single behavior alone i.e. all grooming networks vs. all contact sitting networks. Next we evaluated whether individual network position in multiplex vs. uniplex novel approach or grooming vs. contact sitting traditional approach networks differentially impact inflammatory biomarkers in a commonly studied non-human primate model system the rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta. Being well connected in multiplex networks networks where individuals both contact sat and groomed was associated with lower inflammation IL-6 TNF-alpha. In contrast being well connected in uniplex grooming networks dyad engaged only in grooming and not in contact sitting was associated with greater inflammation. Altogether these results suggest that multiplex relationships may function as supportive relationships e.g. those between kin or strong bonds that promote health. In contrast the function of uniplex grooming relationships may be more transactional e.g. based on social tolerance or social status and may incur physiological costs. This complexity is important to consider for understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of social relationships on human and animal health.",

Our prior assessment in California non-Hispanic whites showed substantial increases in invasive melanoma incidence for tumors of all thicknesses in all neighborhoods categorized by socioeconomic status SES between 1988-1992 and 1998-2002. To understand whether these trends continued we updated our assessment to include the diagnosis period 2008-2012 and more accurate pathologic stage at diagnosis. We used the California Cancer Registry to calculate age-adjusted incidence rates for over 58000 newly diagnosed melanomas. Incidence rates not only continued to rise over the 10-year period from 1998-2002 and 2008-2012 but also showed significant increases in almost all groups defined jointly by tumor thickness or stage at diagnosis and a small area census tract SES measure. The largest relative rate increases were seen for regional distant and ulcerated disease especially among males living in the lowest SES neighborhoods. Considering tumor thickness and stage as proxies for time to screening detection and neighborhood SES as a proxy for health care access we interpret this pattern to indicate continued true increases in melanoma occurrence as opposed to a thin tumor phenomenon simply driven by improved access to care.",

Herbicide use rates were 210 and 280 g aeha for fluroxypyr and clopyralid and 561 g aeha for 24-D amine 24-D ester dicamba picloram and triclopyr. At 14 d after treatment DAT all herbicides caused leaf cupping and epinasty except triclopyr and clopyralid which caused severe bleaching and chlorosis. The order of visual injury ratings was 24-D ester 24-D amine picloram dicamba fluroxypyr triclopyr clopyralid. By 56 DAT slight injury symptoms were observed on plants treated with all herbicides except all rates of 24-D from which symptoms were severe. All rates of 24-D and the highest rate of picloram caused more than 60 flower abortion. Ranking of fiber yield reduction after herbicide treatment was 24-D ester 24-D amine picloram fluroxypyr dicamba clopyralid triclopyr. This research demonstrated that cotton is extremely susceptible to simulated drift rates of 24-D and picloram whereas clopyralid and triclopyr caused early injury with minimal effect on cotton yield.",

Our aim was to fill this research gap. METHODS We analyzed data from a large prospective cohort in the US the Womens Health Initiative WHI. The study included 2396 women with incident colorectal cancer assessed for depressive symptoms and antidepressant use before cancer diagnosis at baseline screening visit in the WHI study during 1993-1998. Participants were followed up from cancer diagnosis till 2018. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios HRs between depression depressive symptoms or antidepressant use at baseline and all-cause mortality and colorectal cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS Among women with colorectal cancer there was no association between baseline depression and all-cause mortality or colorectal cancer-specific mortality after adjusting for age or multiple covariates. CONCLUSION Among women with colorectal cancer there was no statistically significant association between depression before colorectal cancer diagnosis and all-cause mortality or colorectal cancer-specific mortality. Further studies are warranted to assess depressive symptoms and antidepressant use measured at multiple points from baseline to diagnosis and their interactions with specific types of colorectal cancer treatment on the risk of death from colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hydrodynamics is the low-energy effective field theory of any interacting quantum theory capturing the long-wavelength fluctuations of an equilibrium Gibbs densitymatrix. Conventionally one views the effective dynamics in terms of the conserved currents which should be expressed via the constitutive relations in terms of the fluid velocity and the intensive parameters such as the temperature chemical potential etc.. However not all constitutive relations are acceptable one has to ensure that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied on all physical configurations. In this paper we provide a complete solution to hydrodynamic transport at all orders in the gradient expansion compatible with the second law constraint. The key new ingredient we introduce is the notion of adiabaticity which allows us to take hydrodynamics off-shell. Adiabatic fluids are such that off-shell dynamics of the fluid compensates for entropy production. The space of adiabatic fluids is quite rich and admits a decomposition into seven distinct classes. Together with the dissipative class this establishes the eightfold way of hydrodynamic transport. Furthermore recent results guarantee that dissipative terms beyond leading order in the gradient expansion are agnostic of the second law. While this completes a transport taxonomy we go on to argue for a new symmetry principle an Abelian gauge invariance that guarantees adiabaticity in hydrodynamics. We suggest that this symmetry is the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic KMS invariance. We demonstrate its utility by explicitly constructing effective actions for adiabatic transport. The theory of adiabatic fluids we speculate provides a useful starting point for a new framework to describe non-equilibrium dynamics wherein dissipative effects arise by Higgsing the Abelian symmetry.",

Although DENV infection induces lifelong immunity against viruses of the same serotype the antibodies raised appear to contribute to severe disease in cases of heterotypic infections. Understanding the mechanisms of DENV neutralization by antibodies is therefore crucial for the design of vaccines that simultaneously protect against all four viruses. Here we report a comparative high-resolution crystallographic analysis of an A-strand murine monoclonal antibody Mab 4E11 in complex with its target domain of the envelope protein from the four DENVs. Mab 4E11 is capable of neutralizing all four serotypes and our study reveals the determinants of this cross-reactivity. The structures also highlight the mechanism by which A-strand Mabs disrupt the architecture of the mature virion inducing premature fusion loop exposure and concomitant particle inactivation.",

Examination of the skull of Mixosaurus revealed many features to confirm this doubt. Its cranial characters such as the parietal ridge and short supratemporal process of the parietal are shared with derived ichthyopterygians from the Jurassic. Mixosaurus also has features that are derived within the Ichthyopterygia and unique to the genus such as a long sagittal crest reaching the nasal and an expanded anterior terrace of the upper temporal fenestra that also reaches the nasal. Phalarodon Contectopalatus and Sangiorgiosaurus are all considered as junior synonyms of Mixosaurus. The supratemporal squamosal and quadratojugal are all present in Mixosaurus atavus as in basal ichthyopterygians. Because all basal ichthyopterygians and even some derived ichthyopterygians from the Jurassic have these three elements the absence of the squamosal in Ichthyosaurus and Platypterygius should be considered derived if it is not preservational.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To compare three measurement methods for acetabular sizing and evaluate the influence of osteoarthritis OA on the accuracy of measurements. STUDY DESIGN Observational study. SAMPLE Radiographic images of 73 hip joints from 60 dogs with cementless cups. METHODS Radiographs were anonymized and measured independently by three observers. One observer measured 12 sets of radiographs three times. A best-fit acetabular circle AC and cranial-caudal acetabular line AL were measured on ventral-dorsal VD radiographic view and open leg lateral OLL view. A best-fit femoral head circle FHC was measured on VD OLL and craniocaudal horizontal beam CCHB views. Two observers scored the OA in each hip joint. Intra- and interobserver consistency and repeatability and bias relative to implanted cup size were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS Intraobserver consistency and repeatability were excellent for all measurements. Interobserver consistency was excellent ICC 0.9 for ACVD and ACOLL and was good 0.75 ICC 0.9 for all other methods. Bias was small for AC and AL measurements range -0.46 to 0.45 mm and large for FHC measurements -3.58 to -2.42 mm. OA score significantly influenced bias for all acetabular measurement methods p 0.05. CONCLUSION All acetabular measurement methods were highly consistent within an observer. Interobserver consistency was highest for ACVD and ACOLL. FHC measurements underestimated cup size. Higher OA scores decreased the accuracy of all acetabular measurement methods. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Superimposing a circle on the acetabulum seen on VD radiographic view accurately measures the acetabulum before cementless cup placement.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Electrode contact locations are important when planning tailored brain surgeries to identify pathological tissue targeted for resection and conversely avoid eloquent tissue. Current methods employ trained experts to use neuroimaging scans that are manually co-registered and localize contacts within 2 mm. Yet the state of the art is limited by either the expertise needed for each type of intracranial electrode or the inter-modality co-registration which increases error reducing accuracy. Patients often have a variety of strips grids and depths implanted therefore it is cumbersome and time-consuming to apply separate localization methods for each type of electrode requiring expertise across different approaches. NEW METHOD To overcome these limitations a computational method was developed by separately registering an implant magnetic resonance image MRI and implant computed tomography image CT to the pre-implant MRI then calculating an iterative closest point transformation using the contact locations extracted from the signal voids as ground truth. RESULTS The implant MRI is robustly co-registered to the pre-implant MRI with a boundary-based registration algorithm. By extracting and utilizing signal voids the metal induced artifacts from the implant MRI as electrode fiducials the novel method is an all-in-one approach for all types of intracranial electrodes while eliminating inter-modality co-registration errors. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS The distance between each electrode centroid and the brains surface was measured for the proposed method as well as the state of the art method using two available software packages SPM 12 and FSL 4.1. The method presented here achieves the smallest distances to the brains surface for all strip and grid type electrodes i.e. contacts designed to rest directly on the brain surface. CONCLUSION We use one of the largest reported sample sizes in localization studies to validate this novel method for localizing different kinds of intracranial electrodes including grids strips and depth electrodes.",

In many systems particles are found in crowded environments hence it is natural to rigorously characterize the properties of knots in confined volumes. In this work we combine analytical and numerical work on the simple cubic lattice to determine the minimal number of lattice steps minimum step number needed to make a knot inside a tubular region. Our complementary approaches help us establish a detailed enumeration of minimal knot lengths andor conformations of knots in tubular regions. Analytical results characterize the types of knots and links that can be embedded in a tubular regions and determines the minimum number of steps required to construct all 2-bridge knots and links up to ten crossings in the -tube. Simulation results on the other hand estimate the minimum step number and provide exact trajectories of all knot types up to eight crossings for wider tubular regions. These findings not only determine what knots and links can be built in a highly confined volume but also provide further evidence that the minimum step number required to realize a knot type increases with confining volume.",

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of all consecutive emergency blunt trauma sonograms obtained at a level I trauma center from January 1995 to January 2001. Data were collected on demographics free fluid location and patient outcome. Injuries were determined from computed tomography diagnostic peritoneal lavage laparotomy or a combination thereof. RESULTS A total of 4320 blunt trauma sonograms were obtained and 596 patients 14 had intra-abdominal injuries. The mean age was 33.7 - 19.1 years range 1-95 years with 294 49 male and 302 51 female. There was no statistical difference between age sex or mechanism for all subgroups. There were 409 true-positive 187 false-negative 88 false-positive and 3636 true-negative findings. Sensitivity of sonography for detecting all intra-abdominal injuries was 68 and specificity was 97.6 sensitivity for detecting isolated splenic injuries was 73.8. Locations of free fluid in patients with nonsplenic injuries were compared with those in patients with splenic injuries. Isolated left upper quadrant free fluid was significantly associated with splenic injury odds ratio 3.0 P .002 followed by diffuse free fluid odds ratio 2.1 P .005. A subanalysis of isolated splenic injuries also revealed a significant association with left upper quadrant free fluid odds ratio 3.1 P .007 and diffuse free fluid odds ratio 2.7 P .0007. CONCLUSIONS Free fluid in the left upper quadrant is significantly associated with splenic injury. This finding should triage patients more rapidly to computed tomography angiography embolization and laparotomy.",

    "abstract": "While much attention was paid to the interactions of human-driven and automated vehicles at the microscopic level in recent years the understanding of the macroscopic properties of mixed autonomy traffic flow still remains limited. In this paper we present an equilibrium model of traffic flow with mixed autonomy based on the theory of two-player games. We consider self-interested traffic agents i.e. human-driven and automated vehicles endowed with different speed functions and interacting with each other simultaneously in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions. We propose a two-player game model to encapsulate their interactions and characterize the equilibria the agents may reach. We show that the model admits two types of Nash equilibria one of which is always Pareto efficient. Based on this equilibrium structure we propose a speed policy that guarantees the realized equilibria are Pareto efficient in all traffic regimes. We present two examples to illustrate the applications of this model. In one example we construct flux functions for mixed autonomy traffic based on behavior characteristics of agents. In the other example we consider a lane policy and show that mixed autonomy traffic may exhibit counterintuitive behaviors even though all the agents are rational.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Chronic inflammation may promote initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer but no studies have examined the association between inflammation in the period before diagnosis and pancreatic cancer survival. METHODS We prospectively examined the association of prediagnostic plasma levels of C-reactive protein interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- receptor 2 with survival among 492 participants from 5 large US prospective cohort studies who developed pancreatic cancer. Using an empirical dietary inflammatory pattern EDIP score we evaluated whether long-term proinflammatory diets were associated with survival among 1153 patients from 2 of the 5 cohorts. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for death with adjustment for potential confounders. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS Higher prediagnostic levels of C-reactive protein interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- receptor 2 were individually associated with reduced survival Ptrend .03 .01 and .04 respectively. Compared with patients with a combined inflammatory biomarker score of 0 all 3 marker levels below medians those with a score of 3 all 3 marker levels above medians had a hazard ratio for death of 1.57 95 confidence interval 1.16 to 2.12 Ptrend .003 corresponding to median overall survival times of 8 vs 5 months. Patients consuming the most proinflammatory diets EDIP quartile 4 in the prediagnostic period had a hazard ratio for death of 1.34 95 confidence interval 1.13 to 1.59 Ptrend .01 compared with those consuming the least proinflammatory diets EDIP quartile 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract On-shell methods offer an alternative definition of quantum field theory at tree-level replacing Feynman diagrams with recursion relations and interaction vertices with a handful of seed scattering amplitudes. In this paper we determine the simplest recursion relations needed to construct a general four-dimensional quantum field theory of massless particles. For this purpose we define a covering space of recursion relations which naturally generalizes all existing constructions including those of BCFW and Risager. The validity of each recursion relation hinges on the large momentum behavior of an n-point scattering amplitude under an m-line momentum shift which we determine solely from dimensional analysis Lorentz invariance and locality. We show that all amplitudes in a renormalizable theory are 5-line constructible. Amplitudes are 3-line constructible if an external particle carries spin or if the scalars in the theory carry equal charge under a global or gauge symmetry. Remarkably this implies the 3-line constructibility of all gauge theories with fermions and complex scalars in arbitrary representations all supersymmetric theories and the standard model. Moreover all amplitudes in non-renormalizable theories without derivative interactions are constructible with derivative interactions a subset of amplitudes is constructible. We illustrate our results with examples from both renormalizable and non-renormalizable theories. Our study demonstrates both the power and limitations of recursion relations as a self-contained formulation of quantum field theory.",

Therefore the goal of the present study was to compare the proteome of a larger number of N. caninum isolates with different origins and virulence. Label-free LC-MSMS was used to investigate the tachyzoite proteomic differences among Nc-Bahia Nc-Spain4H and Nc-Spain7 representing high virulence isolates and Nc-Ger6 Nc-Spain2H and Nc-Spain1H representing low virulence isolates. Pairwise comparisons between all isolates and between high virulence and low virulence groups identified a subset of proteins with higher abundance in high virulence isolates. These proteins were involved in energy and redox metabolism and DNARNA processing which might determine the faster growth rates and parasite survival of the high virulence isolates. Highlighted proteins included a predicted member of the rhoptry kinase family ROP20 specific for N. caninum Bradyzoite pseudokinase 1 and several dense granule proteins. DNA polymerase which was more abundant in all high virulence isolates in all comparisons might also be implicated in virulence. These results reveal insights into possible mechanisms involved in specific phenotypic traits and virulence in N. caninum and the relevance of these candidate proteins for N. caninum virulence deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "There have been ongoing attempts to create new rapid sensory methods that allow one to have similar outcomes to conventional descriptive analysis but with less training and time. Check-all-that-apply and rate-all-that-apply methods seem to work very well when relatively large numbers of consumers are involved and with relatively more considerable differences among the samples in a product set. In this study results from well-trained descriptive analysis panels were compared to those obtained by using a modified descriptive analysis modified rate-all-that-apply and modified check-all-that-apply with shortened training times and with small panel size. The number of significant attributes and the number of sample pairs that were significantly different was counted. The results indicate that modified rate-all-that-apply can have an equivalent discrimination ability as descriptive analysis when the product set included subtly different samples. Practical Applications Based on this studys results it would seem that the modified rate-all-that-apply with three replications could be an adequate substitute for descriptive analysis in complex samples. The modified rate-all-that-apply technique works well especially when sensory attributes and reference standards are available for ballot training.",

Start with an oriented graph G0 of initially occupied edges on n vertices and iteratively occupy additional oriented edges by transitivity with the constraint that only open edges in a certain random set can ever be occupied. All other edges are closed creating a set of obstacles for the spread of occupied edges. When G0 is an unoriented linear graph and leftward and rightward edges are open independently with possibly different probabilities we identify three regimes in which the set of eventually occupied edges is either all open edges the majority of open edges in one direction or only a very small proportion of all open edges. In the more general setting where G0 is a connected unoriented graph of bounded degree we show that the transition between sparse and full occupation of open edges occurs when the probability of open edges is log n-12o1. We conclude with several conjectures and open problems.",

    "abstract": "We propose a very simple reformulation of general relativity which completely sequesters from gravity all of the vacuum energy from a matter sector including all loop corrections and renders all contributions from phase transitions automatically small. The idea is to make the dimensional parameters in the matter sector functionals of the 4-volume element of the Universe. For them to be nonzero the Universe should be finite in spacetime. If this matter is the standard model of particle physics our mechanism prevents any of its vacuum energy classical or quantum from sourcing the curvature of the Universe. The mechanism is consistent with the large hierarchy between the Planck scale electroweak scale and curvature scale and early Universe cosmology including inflation. Consequences of our proposal are that the vacuum curvature of an old and large universe is not zero but very small that wDE -1 is a transient and that the Universe will collapse in the future.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This study was designed to measure vitamin D metabolites in the aqueous and vitreous humor and in tear fluid and to determine if dietary vitamin D3 supplementation affects these levels. We also determined if the corneal epithelium can synthesize vitamin D following UV-B exposure. METHODS Rabbits were fed a control or vitamin D3 supplemented diet. Pilocarpine-stimulated tear fluid was collected and aqueous and vitreous humor were drawn from enucleated eyes. Plasma vitamin D was also measured. To test for epithelial vitamin D synthesis a human corneal limbal epithelial cell line was irradiated with two doses of UV-B 10 and 20 mJcm2day for 3 days and vitamin D was measured in control or 7-dehydrocholesterol treated culture medium. Measurements were made using mass spectroscopy. RESULTS 25OH-vitamin D3 and 2425OH2-vitamin D3 increased significantly following D3 supplementation in all samples except vitreous humor. Tear fluid and aqueous humor had small but detectable 125OH2-vitamin D3 levels. Vitamin D2 metabolites were observed in all samples. Vitamin D3 levels were below the detection limit for all samples. Minimal vitamin D3 metabolites were observed in control and UV-B-irradiated epithelial culture medium except following 7-dehydrocholesterol treatment which resulted in a UV-B-dose dependent increase in vitamin D3 25OH-vitamin D3 and 2425OH2-vitamin D3. CONCLUSIONS There are measurable concentrations of vitamin D metabolites in tear fluid and aqueous and vitreous humor and oral vitamin D supplementation affects vitamin D metabolite concentrations in the anterior segment of the eye. In addition the UV exposure results lead us to conclude that corneal epithelial cells are likely capable of synthesizing vitamin D3 metabolites in the presence of 7-dehydrocholesterol following UV-B exposure.",

Location in the deep versus superficial lobe of the gland is not directly addressed when defining WT characteristics. Our observation of rare occurrence of deep lobe WT if at all led to the current investigation. The study design is cohort study. This is a retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing parotidectomy for WT in two tertiary academic referral centers the Sheba Medical Center SMC Israel and the Christiana Care CC Newark Delaware USA. 122 consecutive adult patients underwent parotidectomy for WT 72 from SMC and 50 from CC. Seventy percent were males with a mean age of 60.6 years. Bilateral WT or multi-centric WT were found in 9.8 and 17.2 of the cases respectively. In one case the tumor was described as originating in the deep lobe. In all other cases the tumor originated and was limited to the superficial lobe. 99.2 of WT originated in the superficial lobe corresponding with the few reports directly addressing its location in the gland. The reason for the tumor to be limited almost uniformly to the superficial lobe is unknown and could be related to the etiopathogenesis of this elusive entity. We suggest adding tumor location within the superficial lobe to the common characteristics of WT male smoking and lower pole that serve as common criterion while evaluating a parotid lesion.",

    "abstract": "We present a mixed-effects location scale model MELSM for examining the daily dynamics of affect in dyads. The MELSM includes person and time-varying variables to predict the location or individual means and the scale or within-person variances. It also incorporates a submodel to account for between-person variances. The dyadic specification can accommodate individual and partner effects in both the location and the scale components and allows random effects for all location and scale parameters. All covariances among the random effects within and across the location and the scale are also estimated. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay of individual mean structures intra-individual variability and the influence of partner effects on such factors. To illustrate the model we use data from 274 couples who provided daily ratings on their positive and negative emotions toward their relationship - up to 90 consecutive days. The model is fit using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods and includes subsets of predictors in order to demonstrate the flexibility of this approach. We conclude with a discussion on the usefulness and the limitations of the MELSM for dyadic research.",

    "abstract": "With the increased use of time series data in human research ranging from ecological momentary assessments to data passively obtained researchers can explore dynamic processes more than ever before. An important question researchers must ask themselves is do I think all individuals have similar processes If not how different and in what ways Dr. Peter Molenaars work set the foundation to answer these questions by providing insight into individual-level analysis for processes that are assumed to differ across individuals in at least some aspects. Currently such assumptions do not have a clear taxonomy regarding the degree of homogeneity in the patterns of relations among variables and the corresponding parameter values. This paper provides the language with which researchers can discuss assumptions inherent in their analyses. We define strict homogeneity as the assumption that all individuals have an identical pattern of relations as well as parameter values pattern homogeneity assumes the same pattern of relations but parameter values can differ weak homogeneity assumes there are some but not all generalizable aspects of the process and no homogeneity explicitly assumes no population-level similarities in dynamic processes across individuals. We demonstrate these assumptions with an empirical data set of daily emotions in couples.",

We assessed the entire high-producing pen days in milk 100 range 81-241 cows on 10 California farms using measures from the Welfare Quality Protocol for Cattle. Cows were restrained in head locks and visually evaluated for body condition dirtiness skin alterations hair loss lesions or swelling discharge ocular nasal vulvar diarrhea and impaired respiration. Lameness was scored upon release. Prevalence was calculated as a percentage of assessed cows. The most common conditions were dirty hindquarters 33.5 10.7 mean standard deviation and lesions or swelling on the carpal joint 34.4 7.0 and hock 26.4 16.7. Diarrhea 8.0 5.8 lameness moderate 7.3 4.7 severe 2.2 2.2 and neck 5.8 12.6 flank 4.5 5.0 or hindquarter alterations 5.5 3.9 were less common. Very fat cows vulvar discharge and impaired respiration were rare 1 and were excluded from further analysis. Four sampling strategies were used to generate 20 estimates for each animal-based measure. The strategies were 1 selecting every 10th 5th 4th 3rd 2nd 2 of 3 or 3 of 4 cows at the feed bunk 7 estimatesmeasure 2 randomly selecting 7 matching proportions of the pen 3 randomly selecting cows using 3 sample size calculations from the Welfare Quality Protocol and 4 selecting the first middle or final third of cows exiting the milking parlor. Estimates were compared with true values using regression analysis and were considered accurate if they met 3 criteria the coefficient of determination was 0.9 and the slope and intercept did not differ significantly from 1 and 0 respectively. All estimates met the slope and intercept criteria whereas the coefficient of determination increased when more cows were sampled. All estimates were accurate for neck alterations ocular discharge 22.2 27.4 and carpal joint hair loss 14.1 17.4. Selecting a third of the milking order or using the Welfare Quality sample size calculations failed to accurately estimate all measures simultaneously. However all estimates were accurate when selecting at least 2 of every 3 cows locked at the feed bunk. Using restraint position at the feed bunk did not differ systematically from computer-selecting the same proportion of cows randomly and the former may be a simpler approach for welfare assessments.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed at modeling individual and average non-linear trajectories of positional learning using a structured latent growth curve approach. The model is based on an exponential function which encompasses three parameters Initial performance learning rate and asymptotic performance. These learning parameters were compared in a positional learning task administered to a sample comprising the whole adult lifespan N 527 age range 20 years to 89.3 years Mage 52.95 SDage 17.37. Additionally three explanatory variables age speed of information processing and educational level were included in the analyses. All three learning parameters showed reliable individual differences. The correlations between the learning parameters indicated that those participants with high learning rates needed more trials to achieve their asymptotic performance and those who recalled more items initially also had a higher asymptotic performance. Older persons showed lower initial performance and lower asymptotic performance whereas speed of information processing was positively associated only with initial performance. Persons with more years of formal education had a higher initial performance and a higher asymptotic performance. The learning rate in turn appeared to be unaffected by all three predictor variables. 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

HYPOTHESIS Preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 predicts the risk of future all-cause death and cardiovascular death among patients submitted to elective coronary artery bypass surgery. METHODS From a cohort of 312 patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery prospectively followed for a median of 6.7 years we evaluated the prognostic role of preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 inflammatory markers CHA2DS2-VASc score and development of postoperative atrial fibrillation POAF. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to establish an association of these parameters with long term all-cause death and cardiovascular death. RESULTS During 2112 person-years of follow-up we observed 41 deaths 10 were cardiovascular deaths. Independently increased levels of preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 POAF and CHA2DS2-VASc score were associated with all-cause mortality. After multivariate adjustment elevated preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and POAF were the only independent predictors of all-cause death. Also preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 POAF and CHA2DS2-VASc score resulted in being independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS Increased circulating levels of preoperative soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 together with POAF and CHA2DS2-VASc score were significantly associated with future all-cause death and cardiovascular death among patients submitted to coronary artery bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Comparisons were made between three sets of meteorological fields used to support air quality predictions for the California Regional Particulate Air Quality Study CRPAQS winter episode from December 15 2000 to January 6 2001. The first set of fields was interpolated from observations using an objective analysis method. The second set of fields was generated using the WRF prognostic model without data assimilation. The third set of fields was generated using the WRF prognostic model with the four-dimensional data assimilation FDDA technique. The UCDCIT air quality model was applied with each set of meteorological fields to predict the concentrations of airborne particulate matter and gaseous species in central California. The results show that the WRF model without data assimilation over-predicts surface wind speed by 30 on average and consequently yields under-predictions for all PM and gaseous species except sulfate SVI and ozoneO3. The WRF model with FDDA improves the agreement between predicted and observed wind and temperature values and consequently yields improved predictions for all PM and gaseous species. Overall diagnostic meteorological fields produced more accurate air quality predictions than either version of the WRF prognostic fields during this episode. Population-weighted average PM2.5 exposure is 40 higher using diagnostic meteorological fields compared to prognostic meteorological fields created without data assimilation. These results suggest diagnostic meteorological fields based on a dense measurement network are the preferred choice for air quality model studies during stagnant periods in locations with complex topography. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using relative changes in 72 transcription factors and 9 environmental factors EFs this model accurately predicts dynamic transcriptional responses of all these genes in 147 newly collected experiments representing completely novel genetic backgrounds and environments-suggesting a remarkable degree of network completeness.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Whereas organized trauma care systems have decreased trauma mortality in the United States trauma system design has not been well addressed in developing nations. We sought to determine areas in greatest need of improvement in the trauma systems of developing nations. METHODS We compared outcome of all seriously injured Injury Severity Score or 9 or dead nontransferred adults managed over 1 year in three cities in nations at different economic levels 1 Kumasi Ghana low income gross national product GNP per capita of 310 no emergency medical service EMS 2 Monterrey Mexico middle income GNP 3900 basic EMS and 3 Seattle Washington high income GNP 25000 advanced EMS. Each city had one main trauma hospital from which hospital data were obtained. Annual budgets in US per bed for these hospitals were as follows Kumasi 4100 Monterrey 68000 and Seattle 606000. Data on prehospital deaths were obtained from vital statistics registries in Monterrey and Seattle and by an epidemiologic survey in Kumasi. RESULTS Mean age 34 years and injury mechanisms 79 blunt were similar in all locations. Mortality declined with increased economic level Kumasi 63 of all seriously injured persons died Monterrey 55 and Seattle 35. This decline was primarily due to decreases in prehospital deaths. In Kumasi 51 of all seriously injured persons died in the field in Monterrey 40 and in Seattle 21. Mean prehospital time declined progressively Kumasi 102 - 126 minutes Monterrey 73 - 38 minutes Seattle 31 - 10 minutes. Percent of trauma patients dying in the emergency room was higher for Monterrey 11 than for either Kumasi 3 or Seattle 6. CONCLUSIONS The majority of deaths occur in the prehospital setting indicating the importance of injury prevention in nations at all economic levels. Additional efforts for trauma care improvement in both low-income and middle-income developing nations should focus on prehospital and emergency room care. Improved emergency room care is especially important in middle-income nations which have already established a basic EMS.",

Tests were performed in the as-machined untreated anodized laser peened and laser peened then anodized conditions. The results show that laser-peened specimens exhibited significantly improved fatigue performance with non-anodized specimens having a factor of 5-14 improvement in fatigue life depending on stress level and anodized specimens having a factor of 8-9 improvement in fatigue life. Without laser peening anodized specimens had reduced fatigue life at all stress levels. With laser peening anodized and non-anodized specimens had similar lives at high stress life 105 cycles but anodized specimens had shorter lives at low stress. In addition to the fatigue results surface quality and fatigue initiation locations were evaluated and compared between the specimen conditions. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Pheromones and other semiochemicals play a crucial role in todays integrated pest and vector management strategies. These semiochemicals are typically discovered by bioassay-guided approaches. Here we applied a reverse chemical ecology approach that is we used olfactory proteins to lead us to putative semiochemicals. Specifically we used 7 of the top 10 odorant receptors ORs most expressed in the antennae of the southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus and which are yet to be deorphanized. We expressed these receptors in the Xenopus oocyte recording system and challenged them with a panel of 230 odorants including physiologically and behaviorally active compounds. Six of the ORs were silent either because they are not functional or a key odorant was missing. CquiOR36 which showed the highest transcript levels of all OR genes in female antennae was also silent to all odorants in the tested panel but yielded robust responses when it was accidentally challenged with an old sample of nonanal in ethanol. After confirming that fresh samples were inactive and through a careful investigation of all possible contaminants in the old nonanal samples we identified the active ligand as acetaldehyde. That acetaldehyde is activating CquiOR36 was further confirmed by electroantennogram recordings from antennae of fruit flies engineered to carry CquiOR36. Antennae of female mosquitoes also responded to acetaldehyde. Cage oviposition and dual-choice assays demonstrated that acetaldehyde is an oviposition attractant in a wide range of concentrations and thus of potential practical applications.",

The mean quantal content of endplate potentials m the mean quanta available for immediate release n and the mean quantal stores N were all decreased. In contrast the mean probability of quantal release p was normal and the mean probability of quantal store release P was surprisingly high at the majority of ALS endplates.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND There has been little improvement in the survival of adolescent and young adult AYA cancer patients aged 15 to 39 years relative to other age groups raising the question of whether such patients receive appropriate initial treatment. METHODS We examined receipt of initial cancer treatment for a population-based sample of 504 AYAs diagnosed in 2007-2008 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphoma germ cell cancer or sarcoma. Registry data patient surveys and detailed medical record reviews were used to evaluate the association of patient demographic socioeconomic and health care setting characteristics with receipt of appropriate initial treatment which was defined by clinical specialists in AYA oncology based on adult guidelines and published literature available before 2009 and analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS Approximately 75 of AYA cancer patients in our sample received appropriate treatment 68 after excluding stage I male germ cell patients who all received appropriate treatment. After this exclusion appropriate treatment ranged from 79 of sarcoma patients to 56 of ALL patients. Cancer type P .01 and clinical trial participation P .04 were statistically significantly associated with appropriate treatment in multivariable analyses. Patients enrolled in clinical trials were more likely to receive appropriate therapy relative to those not enrolled 78 vs 67 adjusted odds ratio 2.6 95 confidence interval 1.1 to 6.4. CONCLUSIONS Except for those with early stage male germ cell tumors approximately 30 or 3 in 10 AYA cancer patients did not receive appropriate therapy. Further investigation is required to understand the reasons for this potential shortfall in care delivery.",

    "abstract": "This research report presents the results of tirepavement noise friction drainability and profile measurements performed on conventional diamond grind CDG and grind and groove GnG concrete pavement surface textures as a part of the California Department of Transportation Caltrans Quieter Pavement Research QPR study to investigate tirepavement noise on concrete pavements. The On-board Sound Intensity OBSI method AASHTO TP 76 was used to measure tirepavement noise. Longitudinal profile data were collected at the same time as the OBSI data using an inertial profiler ASTM E950 and were used to calculate the International Roughness Index IRI. Friction was measured using the Towed Skid Trailer ASTM E274 and the California Portable Skid Tester CT 342 and estimated using the Circular Track Meter ASTM E2157 and Dynamic Friction Tester ASTM E1911. Drainability was measured using the Outflow Meter ASTM E2380. Seven pilot projects scheduled for CDG were selected for this research study. They include one each in San Diego San Joaquin and Yolo counties and four in Sacramento County. At these seven sites measurements were made before and after construction and in between construction phases when possible. The GnG surface texture was found to be quieter than the CDG with lane average OBSI values on the GnG texture ranging from 99.5 dBA to 101.7 dBA with an average of 100.8 dBA compared with a range of 100.6 dBA to 104.7 dBA and an average of 102.8 dBA measured on the CDG surface texture. The average OBSI level for all GnG sections was 100.8 dBA compared with an average of 102.8 for all CDG sections. OBSI values on the CDG texture on the San Diego 5 project decreased by 0.5 dBA over 1.3 years where OBSI was measured several times after initial construction. This reduction was attributed to flattening of the fins produced by CDG during construction. The average OBSI for all sections prior to treatment was 104.4 dBA although not all sections had measurements of both CDG and GnG. The IRI measurements showed that both CDG and GnG texturing treatments improved smoothness substantially compared with the pretreatment values. The average IRI was reduced from 142 in.mi for the preconstruction surface textures to 64 in.mi on average after the CDG treatment and to 49 in.mi on average after the GnG texture treatment. Both the OBSI and IRI are improved by CDG and even more so by the GnG texturing. Both CDG and GnG remove sealant overbanding and reduce or eliminate faulting at joints and cracks. Both processes also remove imperfections in the slabs caused by curling warping and most of whatever roughness was introduced during initial construction. All of these changes that result from CDG and GnG are likely to contribute to reductions in both noise and roughness. In this study however the individual contributions of removal of faulting and overbanding to noise and roughness reductions were not measured. The few friction measurements on the GnG texture using CT 342 were not sufficient to draw conclusions indicating that further attention should be given to use of this test on this texture if Caltrans continues to use the test. The skid tests using ASTM E 274 indicated that both the CDG and GnG textures passed specifications used by most state highway departments.",

The four regions studied were selected on the basis of sequence differences between the beta chain of hCG beta hCG and the beta chains of related hormones. The peptides were found to bind rabbit and mouse anti-hCG antibodies as well as rabbit anti-beta chain antibodies but did not bind antibodies against the alpha chain or against other hormones. All the peptides even in their free form were able to elicit high titer antisera in both rabbits and mice. In all cases anti-peptide antisera bound to the immunizing peptide as well as to the native hCG and the isolated beta chain. These anti-peptide antisera did not bind to unrelated peptides the alpha chain of hCG or to other hormones with very similar beta chains such as human luteotropic hormone hLH ovine luteotropic hormone oLH and equine chorionic gonadotropin eCG. Since the areas represented by these peptides elicit antibodies that are specific for human beta hCG they can formulate the basis for the development of discriminatory reagents for the beta chain of hCG.",

    "abstract": "The mammary gland can no longer be simply viewed as an organ composed of epithelial cells within a passive stromal microenvironment. Many lines of evidence have evolved to reinforce the notion that mammary epithelial cell growth differentiation lactation and progression to cancer involves bidirectional interactions between the epithelial population and its surrounding stroma. Within this stroma are numerous systems that are all capable of modulating epithelial function. In this context the mammary stroma is not simply a depot of adipose tissue in which mammary epithelial cells undertake a unique growth and differentiation process although adipocytes can impart numerous modulatory signals to epithelial cells and vice versa. Rather the stromal environment constitutes and supports a critical vasculature that supplies nutrients and endocrine cues a lymphatic system that not only removes metabolites but also provides an intimate interface with the immune system and an extracellular matrix scaffold in which epithelial cells grow differentiate and regress. Ultimately all of these components play a critical role in directing the epithelial phenotype during normal mammary gland growth and function. An increasing appreciation for these different systems demands a view of mammary epithelial cells in a much different light and further necessitates the development of model systems that incorporate and integrate increasing complexity.",

METHODS Patients diagnosed as having XLRS underwent assessment. Visual function testing included visual acuity color vision and full-field electroretinography. We used a high-resolution Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography FD-OCT system 4.5-mum axial resolution 9 framess 1000 A-scans per frame combined with a handheld scanner. Macular image evaluation included schisis localization and retinal layer integrity. RESULTS Six patients with XLRS and identified mutations in the XLRS1 gene underwent testing. Visual acuity ranged from 0.2 to 1.6 logMAR logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution. Results of FD-OCT revealed foveal schisis extending from the outer to the inner plexiform layer in 4 of 6 patients. Bullous foveal schisis was associated with younger age. All patients showed extrafoveal schisis within the outer and inner nuclear and ganglion cell layer alone or in combination. Photoreceptor outer and inner segment layers were disrupted and irregular in all patients. CONCLUSIONS Retinal dystrophy in XLRS is reflected by morphological changes within the inner and outer retinal layers. Disturbed foveal photoreceptor integrity was identified in all patients. Retinal layer abnormalities correlated with age but did not appear to correlate with visual acuity or genotypic variation.",

All xMEI showed remarkable rate enhancements up to 1.9105 fold compared with spontaneous hydrolysis. Unexpectedly the electron-donating methyl group acts to decrease the reactivity of the xMEI compared to IMZ except for 45methylimidazole 45MEI. This behavior was attributed to both electronic and steric effects. Moreover reaction intermediates were monitored by NMR and surprisingly the reactivity of the two different 45MEI tautomers was distinguished.",

Primary end points were length of stay and readmission rates. Secondary end points included postoperative pain scores opioid consumption postoperative nausea and vomiting length of urinary catheterization and time to first solid meal. RESULTS ERAS decreased both median total hospital length of stay 6.4 to 4.4 days and post-procedure length of stay 6.0 to 4.1 days. 30-day all-cause readmission rates decreased from 21 to 9.4 . Pain scores improved on postoperative day 0 3.2 to 2.1 and day 1 3.2 to 2.6 despite decreased opioid. Median time to first solid meal decreased from 4.7 to 2.7 days and duration of urinary catheterization decreased from 74 to 46 h. Similar improvements were observed in all other secondary end points. CONCLUSIONS These results confirm that a multidisciplinary iterative team-based approach is associated with a reduction in hospital stay and an acceleration in recovery without increasing readmission rates.",

We demonstrated that epoxide-diol ratios correlated strongly with each other P 0.05 suggesting these ratios all reflect changes in sEH activity. Furthermore we developed a modeling approach to analyze all epoxide-diol ratios simultaneously to infer global sEH activity named SAMI Simultaneous Analysis of Multiple Indices. SAMI improved power in detecting changes in sEH activity in animals and humans when compared to individual ratio estimates.

    "abstract": "The evidence-based medicine movement advocates basing all medical decisions on certain types of quantitative research data and has stimulated protracted controversy and debate since its inception. Evidence-based medicine presupposes an inaccurate and deficient view of medical knowledge. Michael Polanyis theory of tacit knowledge both explains this deficiency and suggests remedies for it. Polanyi shows how all explicit human knowledge depends on a wealth of tacit knowledge which accrues from experience and is essential for problem solving. Edmund Pellegrinos classic treatment of clinical judgment is examined and a Polanyian critique of this position demonstrates that tacit knowledge is necessary for understanding how clinical judgment and medical decisions involve persons. An adequate medical epistemology requires much more qualitative research relevant to the clinical encounter and medical decision making than is currently being done. This research is necessary for preventing an uncritical application of evidence-based medicine by health care managers that erodes good clinical practice. Polanyis epistemology shows the need for this work and provides the structural core for building an adequate and robust medical epistemology that moves beyond evidence-based medicine.",

These clathrates represent the first examples of tetrel-free clathrates that are completely composed of main group elements. All title compounds crystallize in an ordered superstructure of clathrate-I in the Ia3 space group No. 206 Z 8. In the clathrate framework a full ordering of Ga or In and Sb is observed by a combination of high-resolution synchrotron single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. Density functional theory DFT calculations show that all three clathrates are energetically stable with relaxed lattice constants matching the experimental data. Due to the complexity of the crystal structure composed of heavy elements the reported clathrates exhibit ultralow thermal conductivities of less than 1 Wm-1K-1 at room temperature. All compounds are predicted and experimentally confirmed to be narrow-bandgap p-type semiconductors with high Seebeck thermopower values up to 250 VK-1 at 300 K for Cs8In27Sb19. The latter compound shows carrier concentrations and mobilities 1.42 1015 cm-3 and 880 cm2 V-1s-1 which are on par with the values for parent binary InSb one of the best electronic semiconductors. The high hole carrier mobility is uncommon for complex bulk materials and a highly desirable trait opening ways to design semiconducting materials based on tunable III-V clathrates.",

    "abstract": "Meniscus repair has increased in frequency especially among surgeons who focus on youth sports injuries. The aim of this study was to determine current trends in meniscus repair among a specific subset of meniscus repair surgeons. A cross-sectional survey utilizing several clinical vignettes was administered to orthopaedic surgeon members of the Pediatric Research in Sports Medicine PRiSM Society to investigate surgeon experience and training number of meniscus repair procedures performed and surgical and rehabilitation preferences. A statistical analysis of the responses was performed to determine associations between years in practice or type of fellowship training and the number of meniscus repair procedures performed surgical indications and rehabilitation preferences. The response rate to various questions ranged from 61.5 5996 to 63.5 6196. In all vignettes a majority favored repair as well as some degree of weight-bearing and range-of-motion restrictions. Surgeons who had been in practice for 6 to 10 years performed significantly more meniscus repairs per year than those who had been in practice for greater than 20 years p 0.009 and those who had been in practice for 0 to 5 years p 0.05. Surgeons who had been in practice for greater than 20 years performed a significantly higher percentage of meniscectomies relative to meniscus repairs compared with those in practice for 0 to 5 years p 0.002 or 6 to 10 years p 0.0003. When surgeons were grouped into those with less than 10 years of experience and those with greater than 10 years of experience the former group performed a significantly higher number of meniscus repairs relative to meniscectomies than the latter group of surgeons p 0.0001. Less experienced surgeons are more likely to perform meniscus repair than meniscectomy but all surgeons surveyed had a general preference for repair in all clinical vignettes. Repair technique preferences as well as rehabilitation protocols varied widely among surgeons.",

Here we present an analysis of Cbys embryonic expression and morphant phenotypes in Xenopus laevis. Cby RNA is supplied maternally negatively regulated by Snail2 but not Twist1 preferentially expressed in the neuroectoderm and regulates -catenin-mediated gene expression. Reducing Cby levels reduced the density of multiciliated cells the number of basal bodies per multiciliated cell and the numbers of neural tube primary cilia it also led to abnormal development of the neural crest central nervous system and pronephros all defects that were rescued by a Cby-GFP chimera. Reduction of Cby led to an increase in Wnt8a and decreases in Gli2 Gli3 and Shh RNA levels. Many but not all morphant phenotypes were significantly reversed by the Wnt inhibitor SFRP2. These observations extend our understanding of Cbys role in mediating the network of interactions between ciliogenesis signaling systems and tissue patterning.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In the last 4 years four novel oral anticoagulants have been developed as alternatives to warfarin and antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation AF patients. The objective of this review was to estimate the comparative effectiveness of all antithrombotic treatments for AF patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data sources were Medline Ovid 1946 to October 2015 Embase Ovid 1980 to October 2015 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL Issue 9 2015. Randomized controlled trials of AF patients were selected if they compared at least two of the following placebo aspirin aspirin and clopidogrel combination therapy adjusted-dose warfarin target international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0 dabigatran rivaroxaban apixaban and edoxaban. Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted for outcomes of interest all stroke ischemic stroke myocardial infarction overall mortality major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS Based on 16 randomized controlled trials of 96826 patients all oral anticoagulants were more effective than antiplatelet agents at reducing the risk of ischemic stroke and all strokes. Compared to warfarin dabigatran 150 mg rate ratio 0.65 95 credible interval 0.52-0.82 and apixaban rate ratio 0.82 95 credible interval 0.69-0.97 reduced the risk of all strokes. Dabigatran 150 mg was also more effective than warfarin at reducing ischemic stroke risk rate ratio 0.76 95 credible interval 0.59-0.99. Aspirin apixaban dabigatran 110 mg and edoxaban were associated with less major bleeding than warfarin. CONCLUSION All oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in AF patients. Some novel oral anticoagulants are associated with a lower stroke andor major bleeding risk than warfarin. In addition to the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy as reported in this study individual treatment recommendations should also consider the patients underlying stroke and bleeding risk profile.",

    "abstract": "The inclusion of a smother crop used as a cash crop in an intercropping system may be an effective cultural control strategy for the management of weeds in organic production systems. In addition a multilayered canopy created when intercropping species with different growth forms may limit germination cues for weed seeds and can allow for a more efficient utilization of resources that reduce competition to target crops from weeds. Watermelon Citrullus lanatus was evaluated for its ability to reduce weeds in a low-input organic system in Texas when planted alone or in various intercropping combinations that also included peanut Arachis hypogaea okra Abelmoschus esculentus cowpea Vigna unguiculata and hot pepper Capsicum annuum. Watermelon significantly reduced total weed biomass when planted in monoculture and in all intercropping combinations compared with peanut okra cowpea and pepper monocultures in year 1 of the 2-year study. Total weed biomass was reduced by 81 83 88 and 92 in treatments containing watermelon on average as compared with pepper peanut okra and cowpea grown in monoculture respectively. Less effective weed suppression was obtained with watermelon in year 2. Pepper grown in monoculture had significantly higher weed biomass than all other treatments in year 2. Broadleaf weeds were effectively suppressed across all intercropping treatments in year 1 but nutsedges Cyperus sp. were consistently reduced both years particularly when compared with monocrops with small leaf area such as pepper. The three and four species intercropping combinations consistently had high leaf area index LAI values whereas pepper monoculture had significantly lower LAI values than all other treatments except for cowpea monoculture. There was a significant negative relationship between LAI and total weed biomass 33 d after last planting r -0.51 P 0.01. There was a significant negative relationship between total weed biomass and total fruit yield in year 1 r -0.64 P 0.01 but no significant relationship in year 2. Although findings were inconsistent in year 2 because of changes in precipitation amounts and in relative planting dates these findings suggest that incorporating a multifunctional intercropping system that includes a low-growing vining crop such as watermelon or at least an architecturally complex mixture can optimize canopy density to reduce weed pressure from resilient perennial weeds such as nutsedge. This may offer organic producers another management tool for the control of perennial weeds.",

Results were similar when analyses were limited to younger AYAs. Outcomes for AYAs treated in an adult setting did not differ following front-line pediatric or adult ALL regimens.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Metastatic disease to the acetabulum presents a difficult technical and philosophical challenge complicated surgeries in patients with often short life expectancies force us to examine both the outcome and cost of these operations. Therefore we studied the durability of a cement-screw rebar reconstruction technique and risk factors for failure and we compare the results to other reconstruction options. METHODS This is a retrospective review of 52 acetabular reconstructions in 50 patients for nonprimary disease using a retrograde screw-rebar-cement all-polyethylene technique. Mean age was 57 years range 25-81 years. Twenty-four lesions were classified as Harrington class II 28 were Harrington class III. Mean follow-up was 17.7 months range 1-92 months. Outcomes included patient survival prosthesis survival and complications. RESULTS Forty-eight of 50 96 patients ambulated after surgery. Five of 52 9.6 of prostheses failed three from loosening due to tumor progression one from aseptic loosening and one from soft tissue instability dislocation. The three cases of tumor progression failure occurred in patients with massive preoperative ischial tumor burden. Mean surgical time was 198 min and hospital stay was 5.2 days. DISCUSSION The screw-cement-rebar all-polyethylene cup reconstruction technique is a comparatively successful and inexpensive reconstruction option for treating nonprimary oncologic disease in the acetabulum. All cases of loosening occurred beyond the median patient survival. Surgeons should be wary of massive ischial tumor burden in patients with projected longevity as it may be associated with implant failure. Surgical time and hospital stay are consistent with historical data for alternative implants and implant cost is lower.",

To date most studies addressing this selfx2010selection issue fall into nine methodological categories direct questioning statistical control instrumental variables sample selection propensity score joint discrete choice models structural equations models mutually dependent discrete choice models and longitudinal designs. This paper reviews 38 empirical studies using these approaches. Virtually all of the studies reviewed found a statistically significant influence of the BE remaining after selfx2010selection was accounted for. However the practical importance of that influence was seldom assessed. Although time and resource limitations are recognized we recommend usage of longitudinal structural equations modelling with control groups a design which is strong with respect to all causality requisites.",

Salt stress decreased flag leaf greenness SPAD normalized difference vegetation index NDVI levels and carotenoid reflectance index 1 CRI1 levels in all cultivars resulting in reduced net photosynthesis transpiration rates and yield components across all cultivars with Hawm Daeng and PTT1 being most susceptible. In contrast RD69 and SPR1 were more tolerant exhibiting recovered chlorophyll fluorescence levels and total performance index values after 3 days. Salt stress reduced apparent amylose content AAC and increased rapidly available glucose RAG levels in all cultivars. Granule-bound starch synthase I GBSSI expression declined the most in PTT1 and Hawm Daeng. SPAD NDVI CRI1 and photosynthetic parameters were correlated with GBSSI expression at the milky and dough stages of grain development. GBSSI expression levels showed little to no correlation with slowly available glucose but correlated with resistant starch levels at the booting stage of grain development. Salt stress affected yield components and rice starch quality with variations depending on salt susceptibility which in turn affected GBSSI expression levels during the milky and dough stages of grain development.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a highly sensitive and selective analytical method capable of quantifying a total of 15 polybrominated and polychlorinated biphenyls 11 PBBs and 4 PCBs in human serum. Samples were subjected to liquid-liquid extraction followed by solid-phase extraction prior to measurement using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Quantification was performed using isotope-dilution calibration covering a concentration range of 0.005-12.5 ngmL. Limits of detection for all target compounds were in the low range 0.7-6.5 pgmL. The method was validated using in-house pooled human serum fortified at two concentrations 0.5 ngmL and 1.0 ngmL whole semen fortified at one concentration 0.25 ngmL and NIST Standard Reference Material SRM 1958 which includes five of the target compounds. Method accuracies for all target compounds ranged from 84 to 119 with relative standard deviations RSDs of 19. The measured values for the five target compounds present in the SRM agreed with the certified reference values 89-119 accuracy with RSDs 9. As this method was developed to support ongoing epidemiologic investigations we evaluated its suitability by analyzing subsets of serum and whole semen samples from the Michigan PBB Registry cohort. PBB-153 PCB-118 PCB-138 PCB-153 and PCB-180 were detected in all serum samples analyzed with PBB-77 and PBB-101 detected less frequently in serum. PBB-153 PCB-118 PCB-138 PCB-153 and PCB-180 were detected in at least one whole semen sample.",

Applying these results to the Logistic Ricker and generalized Beverton-Holt maps with constant harvesting rates two birfurcations are shown to lead to sudden population disappearances a saddle node bifurcation corresponding to a transition from bistability to extinction and a chaotic blue sky catastrophe corresponding to a transition from bistability to essential extinction.",

Three Phytophthora taxa and all downy mildew taxa were excluded from the previously recognized subgeneric clades of Phytophthora though all were strongly supported within the paraphyletic genus. Downy mildews appear to be polyphyletic with graminicolous downy mildews GDM brassicolous downy mildews BDM and downy mildews with colored conidia DMCC forming a clade with the previously unplaced Phytophthora taxon totara downy mildews with pyriform haustoria DMPH were placed in their own clade with affinities to the obligate biotrophic P. cyperi. Results suggest the recognition of four additional clades within Phytophthora but few relationships between clades could be resolved. Trees containing all twenty extant downy mildew genera were produced by adding partial coverage of seventeen additional downy mildew taxa these trees supported the monophyly of the BDMs DMCCs and DMPHs but suggested that the GDMs are paraphyletic in respect to the BDMs or polyphyletic. Incongruence between nuclear-only and mitochondrial-only trees suggests introgression may have occurred between several clades particularly those containing biotrophs questioning whether obligate biotrophic parasitism and other traits with polyphyletic distributions arose independently or were horizontally transferred. Phylogenetic approaches may be limited in their ability to resolve some of the complex relationships between the subgeneric clades of Phytophthora which include twenty downy mildew genera and hundreds of species.",

METHODS A retrospective review of all CT abdomenpelvic examinations from January 1 2004 through December 31 2008 identified cases of misty mesentery. The largest mesenteric lymph node was measured and additional areas of lymphadenopathy were identified. Follow-up was obtained by reviewing all subsequent CT examinations clinical notes and pathologic specimens. Patients were excluded if they had a known malignancy at the time of initial CT CT or clinical history revealing a cause for the misty mesentery or CT follow-up of less than 2 years. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients with misty mesentery were included. The mean time from the original CT to the latest follow-up was 3.8 years. The largest lymph node measured less than 10 mm in 30 81 of 37 patients. All 30 patients demonstrated stable lymph node size had no other regions with lymphadenopathy and none developed malignancy. The largest lymph node was 10 mm or greater in 7 19 of 31 patients. Three of these patients developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma 2 of which had other areas of lymphadenopathy. No cases of nonlymphomatous malignancy were identified. CONCLUSIONS The development of malignancy in patients with incidentally detected misty mesentery correlates with mesenteric lymph node size. Patients with misty mesentery and largest mesenteric lymph node less than 10 mm without additional areas of lymphadenopathy demonstrate a benign course and no further follow-up may be necessary.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To describe the semiquantitative acid-base status of dogs with untreated naturally occurring typical hypoadrenocorticism and to compare this to the status determined by traditional acid-base analysis. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING University teaching hospital. ANIMALS Thirty-three dogs with newly diagnosed typical hypoadrenocorticism between 2000 and 2017. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Dogs were included if they had newly diagnosed hypoadrenocorticism post-ACTH stimulation serum cortisol concentration 2 gdL and blood collected within 6 hours of presentation for acid-base electrolyte and serum biochemical assays. Dogs were excluded if the Na K ratio was 28 or the dog had received a mineralocorticoid-containing corticosteroid medication within the preceding month. Traditional acid-base analysis identified normal acid-base status in 1 dog simple respiratory acid-base abnormalities in 2 of 33 dogs and simple metabolic acidosis in 14 of 33 dogs. A mixed disorder was most common noted in 16 of 33 dogs. The semiquantitative approach identified metabolic abnormalities in all cases. All dogs had 1 acidifying process and 29 of 33 had both acidifying and alkalinizing processes. Acidosis attributable to excess free water was present in all dogs and an acidifying phosphate effect was present in 27 of 33. Hyperlactatemia contributed to the acidosis in 8 of 33 dogs with a median range lactate concentration of 1.5 mmolL 13.5 mgdL 0.3-4.2 mmolL 2.7-37.8 mgdL. CONCLUSIONS Dogs with untreated Addisons disease have complex acid-base derangements. The semiquantitative approach to acid-base analysis provides greater insight into the underlying mechanisms of metabolic acid-base abnormalities in these dogs particularly because lactic acidosis appears to be a minor influence in most cases.",

All participants lived in Northern California had higher education and incomes that did not limit their vegetable purchase. Intercultural differences in vegetable preferences and consumption habits were found. Mothers across all groups agreed on the importance of childrens vegetable consumption the influence that mothers have over their childrens vegetable intake and how challenging it is to get children to eat a variety of vegetables. The ethnic groups differed regarding how they perceived the level of mothers responsibility over childrens vegetable intake the way that mothers defined the amount of vegetables that children should eat the constraints that mothers had on increasing their childrens vegetable intake and mothers recommendations to encourage vegetable consumption.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The emergence of minimally invasive thoracic surgery has positively impacted postoperative recovery. Robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery RATS has been shown to have equivalent short- and long-term outcomes as compared with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery VATS. The introduction of RATS offers a three-dimensional high-definition image improved ergonomics and wristed movement. The purpose of this paper was to define the learning curve of RATS. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of a single surgeons RATS experience in a community hospital. All patients who underwent RATS between December 2011 and April 2014 were included. The cohort was divided into 2 groups early and late. These groups were created based on the date before or after February 2013 respectively. Data is presented as means and percentages. Significance was defined as a P value 0.05. All categorical variables were evaluated with Fishers exact t test and all continuous variables were compared via a paired t test. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients were identified with a mean age of 59. There were 39 patients in the early group and 40 in the late. Rates of conversion to open thoracotomy 13 vs 10 P 0.74 and operative time 180 vs 204 min P 0.34 did not demonstrate any statistical significance between the two cohorts. Postoperative morbidity 21 vs 28 P 0.60 and mortality 3 vs 0 P 1.00 were equivalent between both groups. There was a higher percentage of lobectomies performed during the late group 38 vs 65 P 0.02. Furthermore these lobectomies were performed at a faster rate in the late group. CONCLUSION Based on our experience the complexity of the operations that can be performed robotically increased with the number of operations performed without an impact on postoperative morbidity and mortality.",

OBJECTIVE To evaluate trends in urolith composition in dogs and to assess risk factors for urolithiasis including age breed sex neuter status urolith location and bacterial urolith cultures. SAMPLE POPULATION A total of 10 444 uroliths and the dogs from which they were obtained. METHODS The laboratory database at the UC Davis Gerald V. Ling Urinary Stone Analysis Laboratory was searched for all urolith submissions from dogs between January 2006 and December 2018. Mineral type age breed sex neuter status urolith location and urolith culture were recorded. Trends were evaluated and variables compared to evaluate risk factors. RESULTS Calcium oxalate CaOx and struvite-containing uroliths comprised the majority of all submissions from dogs representing 47.0 and 43.6 respectively. The proportion of CaOx-containing uroliths significantly decreased from 49.5 in 2006 to 41.8 in 2018 P .006 with no change in the proportion of struvite-containing urolith submissions. Cystine-containing uroliths comprised 2.7 of all submissions between 2006 and 2018 and a significant nonlinear increase in this mineral type occurred over time 1.4 of all submissions in 2006 to 8.7 in 2018 P .001. Of all cystine-containing uroliths 70.3 were from intact male dogs. Age breed and sex predispositions for uroliths were similar to those previously identified. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Although calcium oxalate- and struvite-containing uroliths continue to be the most common uroliths submitted from dogs a decrease in the proportion of CaOx-containing uroliths and an increase in the proportion of cystine-containing uroliths occurred during the time period evaluated.",

PROCEDURES Medical records of dogs examined between September 2012 and July 2018 were reviewed for diagnoses of anterior ALL or posterior PLL lens luxation or lens subluxation. RESULTS Estimates of IOP obtained with rebound and applanation tonometry significantly differed from each other for all types of lens instability considered collectively mean SE difference between tonometric readings 8.1 1.3 mm Hg and specific types of lens instability considered individually mean SE difference between tonometric readings ALL 12.8 2.5 mm Hg PLL 5.9 1.7 mm Hg subluxation 2.8 0.8 mm Hg. Median range differences between rebound and applanation tonometer readings for dogs with ALL was 5 mm Hg -9 to 76 mm Hg with PLL was 3 mm Hg -1 to 19 mm Hg and with lens subluxation was 3 mm Hg -9 to 18 mm Hg. In eyes with ALL rebound tonometer readings exceeded applanation tonometer readings on 44 of 60 73 occasions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Rebound tonometry yielded higher estimates of IOP than did applanation tonometry in eyes with ALL and with all types of lens luxation considered collectively. Estimates of IOP in eyes with lens instability should ideally be obtained with both rebound and applanation tonometers. Veterinarians with only one type of tonometer should interpret results for dogs with lens instability concurrent with physical examination findings.",

We have identified natural compounds from humans and birds which are detected with extreme sensitivity by olfactory receptor neurons ORNs on the antennae of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Cx. quinquefasciatus. One of these semiochemicals nonanal dominates the odorant spectrum of pigeons chickens and humans from various ethnic backgrounds. We determined the specificity and sensitivity of all ORN types housed in different sensilla types on Cx. quinquefasciatus antennae. Here we present a comprehensive map of all antennal ORNs coding natural ligands and their dose-response functions. Nonanal is detected by a large array of sensilla and is by far the most potent stimulus thus supporting the assumption that Cx. quinquefasciatus can smell humans and birds. Nonanal and CO2 synergize thus leading to significantly higher catches of Culex mosquitoes in traps baited with binary than in those with individual lures.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is the most common and curable malignant pediatric disease in children. In low- and middle-income countries however economic factors prevent many patients from receiving complete treatment even as government and insurance entities lack complete data on the costs for ALL therapies. Here we analyzed the overall costs for pediatric ALL therapies and their constitutive elements. PROCEDURE All cost information was drawn from our hospital database. We analyzed the costs of 45 newly diagnosed children with ALL from May 2005 to June 2006 20 were classified into low-risk group 25 into medium-risk group and all had completed the ALL-2005 protocol treatment. Forty cases were B-lineage four were T-lineage and one was double-lymphoid lineage. RESULTS Average total clinic expense per person was US 3694.58 - 1376.85. Average total in-hospital expense per patient was US 7299.48 - 6526.39 with a large individual difference. Medicine and laboratory test costs represented 40.5 and 21.5 respectively. Patients stayed at home or attended clinic for more than 90 of the therapy period. In-hospital and clinic constituted 66.4 and 33.6 of costs respectively. Costs among risk groups and withwithout severe complications differed significantly P 0.05. Thirty-month event-free survivals were 94.14 and 82.81 for the low- and medium-risk groups respectively. CONCLUSION Risk group and severe complications were main factors affecting total medical costs. Average overall costs for childhood ALL in this study were less than US 11000 with reasonable clinical results.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE A recent report suggested improvements in survival after follicular lymphoma FL but not for all racialethnic groups. To better understand the reasons for these FL survival differences we examined the joint influences of diagnostic period raceethnicity and neighborhood socioeconomic status SES on survival in a large population-based case series. METHODS All patients n 15937 diagnosed with FL between 1988 and 2005 in California were observed for vital status through November 2007. Overall and FL-specific survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression. Neighborhood SES was assigned from United States Census data using residence at diagnosis. RESULTS Overall and FL-specific survival improved 22 and 37 respectively from 1988 to 1997 to 1998 to 2005 and were observed in all racialethnic groups. AsianPacific Islanders had better survival than non-Hispanic white Hispanic and black patients who had similar outcomes. Lower neighborhood SES was associated with worse survival in patients across all stages of disease P for trend .01. Patients with the lowest SES quintile had a 49 increased risk of death from all causes hazard ratio HR 1.49 95 CI 1.30 to 1.72 and 31 increased risk of death from FL HR 1.31 95 CI 1.06 to 1.60 than patients with the highest SES. CONCLUSION Evolving therapies have likely led to improvements in survival after FL. Although improvements have occurred within all racialethnic groups lower neighborhood SES was significantly associated with substantially poorer survival.",

Grain samples were produced from replicated trials at 25 sites across four years. Climatic conditions varied between years as well as between sites. Several of the trial sites were irrigated while the remaining were produced under dryland conditions. A number of the dryland sites suffered severe drought stress. The grain size data was analysed for genetic G environmental E and genotype by environment GE interactions. All analyses included maturity as a covariate. The genetic effect on grain size was greater than environmental or maturity effects despite some sites suffering terminal moisture stress. The model was used to calculate heritability values for each site used in the study. These values ranged from 89 to 98 for plump grain and 88 to 96 for retention. The results demonstrated that removing the sources of non-heritable variation such as maturity and field effects can improve genetic estimates of the retention and plump grain fractions. By partitioning all variance components and thereby having more robust estimates of genetic differences plant breeders can have greater confidence in selecting barley genotypes which maintain large stable grain size across a range of environments.

Recent reports suggest that VTE in hematological malignancies is not rare.jatsp jatspMaterials and Methods The California Cancer Registry was linked to both the California Patient Discharge Data Set and the master death registry to determine the incidence of VTE exclusive of upper extremity DVT in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia AML and acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL over a 6-year period and overall survival. Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to analyze the effect of potential risk factors on the incidence of VTE and death.jatsp jatspResults There were 5394 cases with AML 45.4 women mean age 60.4 21 years. The cumulative incidence and person-time rate of VTE are shown in the table. Significant predictors of VTE were female sex hazard ratio HR1.4 CI 1.01.9 2 chronic co-morbidities HR 1.8 CI 1.22.6 the presence of a catheter HR1.6 CI 1.12.3 and advancing age HR 4 for each decade starting at 16 years but not FAB category. Diagnosis of VTE was not associated with reduced survival. Significant predictors of death within 2 years were an increasing number of chronic co-morbidities HR 1.3 for increasing co-morbidities and advancing age referent age lt 16 HR 1.6 for each decade. FAB M3 was associated with improved survival. There were 2482 cases of ALL 42.7 women mean age 25.3 25 years. The cumulative incidence and person-time incidence rate of VTE are shown in the table. Three or more co-morbidities HR2.5 CI 1.25.0 increasing age HR 5.4 for each decade and the presence of a catheter HR2.3 CI 1.34.3 were risks factors for VTE but not FAB classification. Predictors of death in patients with ALL were 3 co-morbidities HR1.5 CI 1.21.9 increasing age HR 3.6 for each decade and FAB L3 but not VTE.jatsp jatspConclusions VTE in patients with AMLALL was not rare. The two-year cumulative incidence of VTE in patients with either AML or ALL was about 3.6 with over half the cases diagnosed in the first 3 months. This incidence and time course are similar to the findings reported among patients with solid tumors. Presence of chronic medical co-morbidities was associated with development of VTE as was the presence of a catheter. The higher risk of VTE in females with AML is unexplained. In contrast to patients with solid tumors VTE was not a predictor for shortened survival in acute leukemia patients. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in patients hospitalized with acute leukemia.jatsp jatspCumulative Incidence and Rate of VTE in Acute Leukemia Cumulative Incidence Rate per 100 patient years Time AML n5394 ALL n2482 AML ALL lt 3 months 120 2.2 52 2.1 12.6 9.3 46 months 34 0.6 18 0.7 5.1 3.5 712 months 27 0.5 13 0.5 2.8 1.4 1324 months 14 0.3 9 0.4 1.1 0.5 Total 195 3.6 92 3.7 5.0 2.5jatsp",

DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional study. SAMPLE Dry n 20 and canned 20 nontherapeutic canine diets. PROCEDURES Reported maximum CF concentrations were obtained from product labels. Concentrations of CF and TDF were measured in samples of the diets for comparison. For each diet percentages of TDF represented by insoluble dietary fiber IDF and soluble dietary fiber SDF were determined. RESULTS For dry or canned diets the median reported maximum CF concentration was significantly greater than the median measured value. Measured CF concentration was significantly lower than measured TDF concentration for all diets. Median percentage of TDF dry-matter basis in dry and canned diets was 10.3 and 6.5 respectively overall range 3.9 to 25.8. Fiber composition in dry and canned diets differed median percentage of TDF provided by IDF dry-matter basis was 83.4 in dry diets and 63.6 in canned diets. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Among the evaluated diets measured CF concentration underrepresented measured TDF concentration. Diets provided a wide range of TDF concentration and proportions of IDF and SDF were variable. In the absence of information regarding TDF concentration neither reported maximum nor measured CF concentration appears to be a particularly reliable indicator of fiber concentration and composition of a given canine diet.",

We assessed the impact of infant immunization on pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations and mortality in all age groups using Health Care Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases SID for 1996 to 2006 from 10 states SID contain 100 samples of ICD9-coded hospitalization data for the selected states. Compared to a 1996-1997 through 1998-1999 baseline by the 2005-2006 season both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths had decreased substantially in all age groups including a 47 95 confidence interval CI 38 to 54 reduction in nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia ICD9 code 481 with no codes indicating IPD in infants 2 years old and a 54 reduction CI 53 to 56 in adults 65 years of age.

Ninety percent of the reduction in model-attributed pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations occurred through herd immunity among adults 18 years old and older similar proportions were found in pneumococcal disease mortality prevented by the vaccine. In the first seasons after PCV introduction when there were substantial state differences in coverage among 5-year-olds states with greater coverage had significantly fewer influenza-associated pneumonia hospitalizations among children suggesting that PCV7 use also reduces influenza-attributable pneumonia hospitalizations.",

We evaluated a leaf color chart LCC as a simple tool for improving the time and rate of N fertilizer use in farmers fields for 4 years 2000-2003 in irrigated rice in northwestern India. Application of N fertilizer whenever leaf greenness was less than shade 4 on the LCC the critical LCC value produced rice grain yields on a par with blanket recommendation of applying 120 kg N ha-1 in three equal splits in different years but it resulted in an average saving of 26 fertilizer N across villages and seasons. In most situations there was no significant advantage of applying 20 kg N ha-1 as basal N at transplanting on grain yield and NUE of rice compared with no basal N. Use efficiencies of fertilizer N were higher when N was applied using LCC with a critical value of 4 than the recommended practice of applying 120 kg N ha-1 in three equal split doses on all sites and in all years. The LCC with a critical value of 4 for real-time N management can be efficiently used to increase NUE in all types of inbred rice cultivars presently popular with the farmers of the Indian Punjab. The LCC is a cheap and easy-to-use tool that allows real-time N management by farmers on a large area leading to improved fertilizer N use efficiency and reduced risks associated with fertilizer N application. 2007 Springer ScienceBusiness Media B.V.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND This study was motivated by the observation of unusual mitochondrial haplotype distributions and associated physiological differences between populations of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus distributed along the Atlantic coast of North America. A distinct northern haplotype is fixed in all populations north of New Jersey and does not appear south of New Jersey except in extreme upper-estuary fresh water habitats and northern individuals are known to be more tolerant of hyposmotic conditions than southern individuals. Complete mitochondrial genomes were sequenced from individuals from northern coastal southern coastal and fresh water populations and from out-groups. Comparative genomics approaches were used to test multiple evolutionary hypotheses proposed to explain among-population genome variation including directional selection and hybridization. RESULTS Structure and organization of the Fundulus mitochondrial genome is typical of animals yet subtle differences in substitution patterns exist among populations. No signals of directional selection or hybridization were detected. Mitochondrial genes evolve at variable rates but all genes exhibit very low dNdS ratios across all lineages and the southern population harbors more synonymous polymorphism than other populations. CONCLUSION Evolution of mitochondrial genomes within Fundulus is primarily governed by interaction between strong purifying selection and demographic influences including larger historical population size in the south. Though directional selection and hybridization hypotheses were not supported adaptive processes may indirectly contribute to partitioning of variation between populations.",

    "abstract": "All-terrain vehicle ATV incidents are one of the leading causes of injuries and fatalities among youth in the agricultural industry. It has been hypothesized that many youth-related ATV incidents occur because children ride ATVs that do not fit their capabilities and are not following basic safe riding practices. In addition various ATV safety guidelines regarding youth e.g. CPSC ANSISVIA ASI are inconsistent and may not align with state or local laws. To the best of our knowledge no comprehensive studies have compared the physical and mental requirements for riding ATVs and the youths capabilities to ride ATVs safely. Consequently there are no scientific-based recommendations for age limitation physical and mental capabilities and safety requirements for youth to ride ATVs safely. Thus there is a need to review the available sources related to youth safety and ATVs in the agricultural industry identify the research voids and recommend modifications to current ATV guidelines. This study conducted a systematic review of available ATV-related studies standards guidelines and laws to establish better-informed minimum age physical and mental capabilities and safety requirements for youths to ride ATVs on the farm.",

    "abstract": "Medial temporal lobe brain structures such as the amygdala play an important role in the normal perception and generation of emotional behavior. Little research however has assessed the role of such structures across the neurodevelopmental trajectory. We assessed emotional behavioral responses of rhesus macaques that received bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdala or hippocampus at 2 weeks of age and sham-operated controls. At 9 and 18 months of age animals interacted with novel objects that varied in visual complexity as a means of varying emotional salience. All animals behaved differently in the presence of visually simple as compared to complex objects suggesting that they were sensitive to variation in emotional salience. Across both experiments amygdala-lesioned animals appeared to be less behaviorally inhibited insofar as they explored all objects most readily. Interestingly hippocampus-lesioned animals propensity for exploration mirrored that of control animals in some contexts but that of amygdala-lesioned animals in other contexts. At 18 months of age both amygdala-lesioned and hippocampus-lesioned animals were judged to be less fearful than controls during the testing procedure. Implications for understanding the neurobiology of emotional behavior are discussed.",

In particular we have examined the effects of thermal annealing in oxygen on the antiferromagnetic domains and spin orientation in the near surface region of such films. The recorded PEEM micrographs show AFM domains for all samples though the domains are on average larger for the thermally annealed films. XMLD spectra recorded for different angles between the electromagnetic field vector and the film surface normal suggest a characteristic difference in the spin orientation between the as-grown epitaxially strained and the thermally annealed strain relaxed samples. While temperature-dependent measurements reveal little difference in Nel temperature between an as-grown and a fully relaxed film TN645 K and 610 K respectively both are reduced compared to that of bulk LaFeO 3 TN740 K. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "Real-time estimation of battery internal states and parameters is a key task of battery management and has been studied extensively in literature. Estimation is usually performed by an algorithm using a model and the measured input-output data such as current voltage and temperature. Traditionally the estimation algorithms do not differentiate the data points and use all of them equally for estimating each variable. However not all data points but often only a small fraction of them are sensitive to the target variables under estimation. Using insensitive data will induce significant estimation errors due to the commonly presented unknown disturbances such as measurement noise and model uncertainty. This paper studies the data selection mechanism to optimize and guarantee the accuracy of battery state and parameter estimation. A sensitivity-based data selection strategy is proposed which automatically identifies the sensitive data in real-time and passes them to the observer for estimation. It is shown that the data selection strategy could improve the quality of estimation results significantly.",

Based on a normalized local density 1 3 lenses are found to be in both under- and overdense local environments. All three lenses are fit well by singular isothermal ellipsoid models including external shear with Xv2 1. The model shears are 10. Approximating all line-of-sight galaxies as singular isothermal sphere halos truncated at 200 h-1 kpc with masses estimated through the Faber-Jackson relation infers shears of 2 much smaller than those required by the models. Therefore the corresponding convergence estimates must also be suspect. If more realistic treatment of galaxies and the large-scale structure that they are embedded in were to match the inferred shears to the model shears then the true convergence could be measured and the mass-sheet degeneracy broken. 2007.

The model was adapted to operate in a geographic information system GIS to model 14.8 million acres 6.0 million hectares of land. Average erosion potential was low among all RDM scenarios and increased from an estimated 0.05 ton per acre per year 0.11 megagram per hectare per year with the high RDM scenario to 0.12 ton per acre per year 0.27 megagram per hectare per year with the low RDM scenario. Considering all RDM scenarios fewer than 174733 acres 70710 hectares or 1.2 of land had erosion potential that exceeded soil loss tolerance values. Although achieving a uniform RDM target across a landscape may be an oversimplification of reality simulations suggest that erosion potential on average is low in Californias annual rangelands across high moderate and low RDM recommendations. Moreover our findings indicate that grazing management maintaining moderate or high RDM to mitigate erosion can be effective when targeted at areas of high vulnerability.",

Molecular cloning results revealed that ovochymase is translated as part of an unusual polyprotein proenzyme. In addition to the ovochymase protease domain at the C terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence two unrelated serine protease domains were present each with apparent trypsin-like ArgLys-X substrate specificity and thus they were designated ovotryptase1 at the N terminus and ovotryptase2 a mid domain. Also a total of five CUB domains were interspersed between the protease domains. The presence of a hydrophobic signal sequence indicated that the polyprotein was secreted. Immunolocalization and Western blot studies of all three proteases showed that they are all present in the perivitelline space of unactivated eggs apparently as proenzymes processed away from the original polyprotein. Western blot analysis also showed that the vast majority of the proteases in ovary eggs and embryos were present as the proenzyme forms suggesting that the functions of these proteases depend on very limited levels of activation.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Online patient portals are being widely implemented however no studies have examined whether portals influence health behaviors or outcomes similarly across patient racialethnic subgroups. We evaluated longitudinal changes in statin adherence to determine whether racialethnic minorities initiating use of the online refill function in patient portals had similar changes over time compared with Whites. METHODS We examined a retrospective cohort of diabetes patients who were existing patient portal users. The primary exposure was initiating online refill use either exclusively for all statin refills or occasionally for some refills compared with using the portal for other tasks eg exchanging secure messages with providers. The primary outcome was change in statin adherence measured as the percentage of time a patient was without a supply of statins. Adjusted generalized estimating equation models controlled for raceethnicity as a primary interaction term. RESULTS Fifty-eight percent of patient portal users were white and all racialethnic minority groups had poorer baseline statin adherence compared with Whites. In adjusted difference-in-difference models statin adherence improved significantly over time among patients who exclusively refilled prescriptions online even after comparing changes over time with other portal users 4 absolute decrease in percentage of time without medication. This improvement was statistically similar across all racialethnic groups. DISCUSSION Patient portals may encourage or improve key health behaviors such as medication adherence for engaged patients but further research will likely be required to reduce underlying racialethnic differences in adherence. CONCLUSION In a well-controlled examination of diabetes patients behavior when using a new online feature for their healthcare management patient portals were linked to better medication adherence across all racialethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "Genetic evidence suggests that the RecF RecO and RecR RecFOR proteins participate in a common step of DNA recombination and repair yet the biochemical event requiring collaboration of all three proteins is unknown. Here we show that the concerted action of the RecFOR complex directs the loading of RecA protein specifically onto gapped DNA that is coated with single-stranded DNA binding SSB protein thereby accelerating DNA strand exchange. The RecFOR complex recognizes the junction between the ssDNA and dsDNA regions and requires a base-paired 5 terminus at the junction. Thus the RecFOR complex is a structure-specific mediator that targets recombinational repair to ssDNA-dsDNA junctions. This reaction reconstitutes the initial steps of recombinational gapped DNA repair and uncovers an event also common to the repair of ssDNA-tailed intermediates of dsDNA-break repair. We propose that the behavior of the RecFOR proteins is mimicked by functional counterparts that exist in all organisms.",

    "abstract": "Because birds can carry foodborne pathogens widespread concern exists that birds impose food-safety risks to farms. Growers are thus often encouraged to deter birds and forego harvesting crops near bird faeces e.g. no-harvest buffers. Developing a holistic understanding of the pathogen spillover processfrom individual infection to pathogen persistence on cropsis essential to understand and manage food-safety risks associated with birds. Here we coupled field and greenhouse experiments to understand the relative risks associated with different bird species on California farms. We first compared E. coli survival in bird faeces on lettuce soil and plastic mulch to identify where pathogens are likely to persist. Next we quantified pathogen survival in faeces from 10 bird species to identify higher-risk species. Finally we combined pathogen survival data with bird surveys and faecal transects to assess food-safety risks across 29 California lettuce farms. E. coli abundance rapidly declined in bird faeces but rates varied across substrates. E. coli survival was higher on lettuce compared to soil and plastic mulch likely because of lettuces cooler and wetter microclimate. E. coli persistence was also much higher in faeces from larger birdswhich produce larger faecesthan small songbirds. Importantly minimal differences in persistence among species were observed after all faeces were standardized to the same mass. Though bird faeces were common on farms most birds entering farms contacting crops and defecating on crops were small songbirds that defecate small faeces. Coupled with our finding that 90 of faeces were deposited on soil these results suggest that most birds on farms present relatively low food-safety risks. Synthesis and applications. Growers are often encouraged to deter all bird species and forego harvesting crops near all bird faeces but our work suggests not all birds and faeces pose the same food-safety risks. If growers ignored small bird faeces on soil then we estimate that the area of California lettuce farms affected by no-harvest buffers could decrease from 10.3 to 2.7. More broadly our results suggest farmers could promote small insect-eating birds by erecting nest boxes or preserving habitat without necessarily compromising food safety.",

IE was diagnosed antemortem based on clinical signs and echocardiography in 18 dogs. The etiologic agent was Bartonella sp. in 5 dogs 28 and was diagnosed by high seroreactivity to Bartonella titer 1512 range 11024-14096 and confirmed postmortem by positive polymerase chain reaction PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP from the infected valve and partial DNA sequencing of the citrate synthase gene glt A. Conventional bacteria were causative agents in 7 dogs 39. An etiologic agent was not identified in 6 dogs 33. Bartonella vinsonii berkhoffii n 3 B clarridgeiae n 1 and a B clarridgeiae-like organism n 1 were identified. Blood culture was positive only for the IE case due to B clarridgeiae. All dogs with IE due to Bartonella were also seroreactive to Anaplasma phagocytophilum. All dogs with IE due to Bartonella had lesions only on the aortic valve. Of the cases of IE not due to Bartonella 31 involved the aortic valve 61 the mitral valve and 8 both valves. Dogs with mitral valve IE lived longer than all dogs with aortic valve IE P .004 and dogs with IE of the aortic valve due to Bartonella P .002. In conclusion Bartonella is a common cause of IE in dogs of northern California. A high Bartonella serologic titer 1512 is useful antemortem to diagnose aortic valve IE due to Bartonella.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Missing life-threatening injuries is a persistent concern in any trauma program. Autopsy is a tool routinely utilized to determine an otherwise occult cause of death in many fields of medicine. It has been adopted as a required component of the trauma peer review PR process by both the American College of Surgeons and the Pennsylvania Trauma Foundation. We hypothesized that autopsy would not identify preventable deaths for augmentation of the PR process. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review using our institutional trauma registry of all trauma deaths between January 2012 and December 2015 was performed. Per the protocol of our level 1 center all trauma deaths are referred to the medical examiner ME and reviewed as part of the trauma PR process. All autopsy results are evaluated with relation to injury severity score ISS trauma injury severity score TRISS nature of death and injuries added by autopsy. ME reports are reviewed by the trauma medical director and referred back to the trauma PR committee if warranted. Trauma injury severity score methodology determines the probability of survival Ps given injuries identified. A patient with Ps of 0.5 is expected to survive their injuries. Cohorts were created based on when in the hospitalization death occurred 24 h or immediate death 24 to 48 h or early death and death 48 h or late death. A comparison was conducted between the ISS and Ps calculated during trauma workup and on autopsy using chi-square and Fischers exact tests. RESULTS A total of 173 patient deaths were referred to the ME with 123 responses received. Average length of stay was 2.61 d. Twenty-six patients had autopsy declined by the ME 25 received an external examination only and 72 received a full autopsy. Autopsy identified one case that was reconsidered in PR P 0.603 and added diagnoses but not injuries to one patient in the early death group P 1 and two in the late death group P 0.4921. No preventable cause of death was uncovered and educational use was minimal. Autopsy did identify injuries in seven cases that were initially not consistent with expected mortality but postmortem Ps was consistent with expected mortality P 0.254. Mean ISS was 34.48 and mean Ps was 0.275 among all patients. The most commonly identified injuries added by autopsy were rib injuries lung injuries and intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Autopsy does not identify causes of preventable in an otherwise highly functioning trauma program and may be a poor use of institutional resources. In fact it adds few diagnoses when death occurs after a full trauma assessment has had time to take place. Autopsy may be of use to identify protocol failure in maturing trauma programs to give answers to grieving families and in select situations where death was unanticipated even after a full evaluation took place.",

DESIGN Case-control study analyzing all opioid prescriptions for patients with chronic pain during their first year after opioid initiation. Cases were patients who experienced an overall dose escalation of 30 mg morphine equivalents over the 1-year period controls did not experience overall dose escalation. Main measures were encounter type opioid dose change documented prescribing rationale documentation of guideline-concordant opioid-prescribing practices. Two coders reviewed all encounters associated with opioid prescriptions. Analysis of factors associated with dose increases and provider documentation of prescribing rationale was conducted using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS There were 674 encounters coded for 66 patients 22 cases 44 controls. Fifty-three percent of opioid prescriptions were associated with telephone encounters 13 were associated with e-mail encounters. No prescribing rationale was documented for 43 of all opioid prescriptions and 25 of dose increases. Likelihood of dose increase and documentation of prescribing rationale did not significantly differ for cases versus controls. Compared with face-to-face encounters dose increases were significantly less likely for telephone OR 0.18 95 CI 0.11-0.28 and e-mail OR 0.23 95 CI 0.12-0.47 encounters documentation of prescribing rationale was significantly more likely for e-mail OR 5.06 95 CI 1.87-13.72 and less likely for telephone OR 0.30 95 CI 0.18-0.51 encounters. CONCLUSION Most opioid prescriptions were written without face-to-face encounters. One quarter of dose increases contained no documented prescribing rationale. Documented encounter-level factors were not significantly associated with overall opioid dose escalation.",

Routine lipid panel cannot capture all individual lipid species in blood i.e. blood lipidome. To date a comprehensive assessment of the blood lipidome associated with mortality is lacking in large-scale community-dwelling individuals especially in a longitudinal setting. Using liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry we repeatedly measured individual lipid species in 3821 plasma samples collected at two visits 5.5 years apart from 1930 unique American Indians in the Strong Heart Family Study. We first identified baseline lipids associated with risks for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality mean follow-up period 17.8 years in American Indians followed by replication of top hits in European Caucasians in the Malm Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort n 3943 mean follow-up period 23.7 years. The model adjusted age sex BMI smoking hypertension diabetes and LDL-c at baseline. We then examined the associations between changes in lipid species and risk of mortality. Multiple testing was controlled by false discovery rate FDR. We found that baseline levels and longitudinal changes of multiple lipid species e.g. cholesterol esters glycerophospholipids sphingomyelins and triacylglycerols were significantly associated with risks of all-cause or CVD mortality. Many lipids identified in American Indians could be replicated in European Caucasians. Network analysis identified differential lipid networks associated with risk of mortality. Our findings provide novel insight into the role of dyslipidemia in disease mortality and offer potential biomarkers for early prediction and risk reduction in American Indians and other ethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of remifentanil infusion on the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane preventing movement SEVOMACNM and bispectral index BIS in dogs. STUDY DESIGN Prospective unmasked study. ANIMALS A total of 10 adult Beagle dogs weighing 9.0 1.1 kg. METHODS Dogs were anesthetized with sevoflurane and baseline SEVOMACNM was determined. Remifentanil was infused at 5 10 and 20 g kg-1 hour-1 in sequence with 20 minutes washout between infusions. Variables monitored throughout anesthesia included heart rate HR oscillometric blood pressure end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide end-tidal sevoflurane concentration FeSevo and BIS. SEVOMACNM after remifentanil infusion SEVOMACNM-REMI determination started 20 minutes after the start of each infusion. Venous blood samples were collected for plasma remifentanil concentration determination at baseline SEVOMACNM-REMI determination time points and 20 minutes after each infusion was stopped. A mixed model analysis was used to determine the effect of remifentanil infusion on response variables. The relationships between BIS and FeSevo plasma remifentanil concentrations and the percentage decrease in baseline SEVOMACNM were evaluated p 0.05. RESULTS The overall SEVOMACNM at baseline was 2.47 0.11. Addition of remifentanil at all infusion rates significantly decreased SEVOMACNM but the medium and high doses resulted in significantly greater decreases in SEVOMACNM than the lower dose. There was no difference in SEVOMACNM percentage change between infusions 10 and 20 g kg-1 hour-1. Plasma remifentanil concentrations were significantly different in all infusion rates. Baseline BIS value was 70 1 and was lower than the BIS values recorded during all remifentanil infusions. BIS values were not significantly different among infusion rates. HR was lower and mean arterial pressure was higher during remifentanil infusions than at baseline. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE All remifentanil infusions decreased SEVOMACNM in dogs. Remifentanil infusion at any rate studied did not reduce BIS values.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE While the true incidence of secondary hypospadias repair is unknown the current literature cites a 3.3 to 6.7 reoperation rate after distal hypospadias repair and an association with age. We hypothesized that secondary surgery rates are associated with patient factors and have been underreported due to limited followup. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used an academic practice plan consortium database to identify a population that underwent primary hypospadias repair in 2009 and 2010. Secondary surgeries between 2009 and 2019 were captured. The association of variables such as age insurance type region surgeon volume and surgeon years in practice with all-inclusive and specific secondary surgery procedures were analyzed using mixed effects multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS We identified 5178 boys who had primary hypospadias repair performed by 84 pediatric urologists at 46 hospitals in 2009 and 2010. During the ensuing 9 to 10 years distal proximal and perineal hypospadias repair had a 12.6 37.9 and 46.6 rate of secondary surgery respectively. After adjusting for all other variables in the model patients with noncommercial insurance had a 26 OR 1.26 p0.04 increased odds of secondary surgery. Patient age and surgeon years in practice were not associated with all-inclusive secondary surgery except for endoscopic treatment. Surgeon volume was not associated with secondary surgery. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that secondary surgery rates are underreported if followup is limited to less than 6 years. Patient age surgeon volume and experience did not associate with all-inclusive reoperation rates whereas insurance status was a major predictor of reoperation.",

    "abstract": "While many properties of eukaryotic gene structure are well characterized differences in the form and function of introns that occur at different positions within a transcript are less well understood. In particular the dynamics of intron length variation with respect to intron position has received relatively little attention. This study analyzes all available data on intron lengths in GenBank and finds a significant trend of increased length in first introns throughout a wide range of species. This trend was found to be even stronger when using high-confidence gene annotation data for three model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster which show that the first intron in the 5 UTR is--on average--significantly longer than all downstream introns within a gene. A partial explanation for increased first intron length in A. thaliana is suggested by the increased frequency of certain motifs that are present in first introns. The phenomenon of longer first introns can potentially be used to improve gene prediction software and also to detect errors in existing gene annotations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The optimal strategy for lower extremity revascularization surgical bypass versus endovascular intervention in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia CLTI is unclear. We examined the effectiveness of open surgical bypass using single-segment great saphenous vein conduit SSGSV alternative conduits AC or endovascular interventions ENDO among patients with CLTI deemed acceptable for either open surgical bypass or ENDO treatment. METHODS This was a planned as-treated analysis of the multicenter BEST-CLI Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia randomized controlled trial comparing open surgical bypass and ENDO for CLTI due to infrainguinal peripheral artery disease. Outcomes were tabulated based on the initial revascularization received SSGSV bypass AC bypass and ENDO. Analyses were performed for all treated patients and then excluding those who experienced early technical failure. Multivariable Cox regression models were used. End points included the primary trial outcome major adverse limb event MALE or all-cause death major amputation MALE at any time or perioperative 30-day death reintervention-amputation-death and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Among 1780 patients with CLTI treatments received included SSGSV bypass n621 AC bypass n236 and ENDO n923 procedures. There were no significant differences in 30-day mortality major adverse cardiovascular events or serious adverse events subjects treated with ENDO experienced greater MALE within 30 days 13.1 versus 2.7 3 for SSGSV AC P0.001. On risk-adjusted analysis SSGSV bypass was associated with reduced MALE or all-cause death hazard ratio 0.65 95 CI 0.56-0.76 P0.001 major amputation hazard ratio 0.70 95 CI 0.52-0.94 P0.017 MALE or perioperative death hazard ratio 0.51 0.41-0.62 P0.001 and reintervention-amputation-death hazard ratio 0.69 95 CI 0.61-0.79 P0.001. AC bypass was associated with reduced MALE or perioperative death and reintervention-amputation-death compared with ENDO. Significant benefits of SSGSV over ENDO remained when excluding patients who experienced early technical failure. There were no significant differences in long-term mortality by initial treatment received. When analyzed by the level of disease treated the improved outcomes of SSGSV were greatest among patients who underwent femoropopliteal revascularization. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of as-treated outcomes from the BEST-CLI trial demonstrates the safety and clinical superiority of bypass with SSGSV among patients with CLTI who were deemed suitable for either open surgical bypass or ENDO revascularization. Assessment of great saphenous vein quality should be incorporated into the evaluation of patients with CLTI who are surgical candidates.

    "abstract": "Water quality contamination by pathogens and nutrients from cattle fecal deposits is a concern on rangeland watersheds. The temporal and spatial deposition of fecal material relative to storm events and water-bodies determines much of the risk a grazing scheme presents to water quality. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a comparative technique to estimate cattle fecal loading across a watershed through time. Once the method was developed dry and wet season trials were conducted on a 138 ha experimental rangeland watershed at the San Joaquin Experimental Range in 1996-97. Fifty-four permanent 40 m2 belt transects were established across the watershed. Observers ocularly assigned a rank of 1 smallest diameter to 5 largest diameter to each fecal deposit within a transect. A regression relationship was developed to predict fecal deposit dry weight by rank. Load per transect was calculated as the total weight of all fecal deposits in a transect. All fecal deposits in transects were collected and actual fecal load determined. The comparative yield methodology was successfully adapted to estimate rangeland fecal loading. Regression relationships predicting fecal deposit dry weight by ranks were highly significant for all observers p 0.001. The R2 values ranged from 0.97 to 0.99 in the dry season and 0.89 to 0.94 in the wet season. There was no significant difference between the weighed fecal load estimate and the estimates of observers using the comparative method p 0.05. This method provides a rapid simple method for estimating spatial and temporal livestock fecal loading on rangeland watersheds.",

METHODS Data were analyzed from surgeons responding to a survey sent to 557 adult trauma surgeons in the United States and Canada. The survey queried the timing and use of vaccinations in splenic injury patients. RESULTS Three hundred four 54.6 surgeons responded to the survey with 43 no longer active. Of the 261 active surgeons 99.2 immunize their splenectomized patients whereas 15.7 immunize those who undergo splenorrhaphy and 8.4 immunize those managed nonoperatively. Vaccines are administered anywhere from the immediate postoperative period to as long as 6 weeks later. All but two responding surgeons provide the pneumococcal vaccine 62.8 also advocate meningococcal vaccination 72.4 add the Haemophilus influenzae vaccine and 56.7 give all three. Thirteen of the responding surgeons reimplant splenic tissue most frequently in the omentum and in quantities varying from two slices to the entire spleen. Revaccination practices are extremely varied-ranging from nothing at all to annually-and seldom follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. CONCLUSION With the exception of immunizing splenectomized patients against pneumococcal infection little consensus exists among surgeons regarding the immunization of patients sustaining splenic injury.",

    "abstract": "Recently a moderate amount of work has been reported on the use of overlay networks to support value-added network services such as multicasting Quality-of-Service QoS security etc. To design an overlay network the first step is to choose an overlay topology connecting all the overlay service nodes. When considering overlay topologies several questions need to be answered first How overlay topologies affect overlay routing performance Which topologies can provide satisfactory performance How can we construct efficient overlay topologies connecting all the overlay nodes In this paper we focus on the overlay network topology construction issue. First we evaluate and compare the performance and overhead of the existing overlay topologies. Second we formalize the overlay topology construction problem and propose two new heuristic methods to construct efficient overlay topologies. Simulation results have demonstrated the efficiency of the two proposed approaches. It is shown that overlay service performance varies significantly with respect to different overlay topologies. Thus it is important to choose an appropriate overlay network topology. The knowledge of IP-layer topology information also benefits significantly in constructing efficient overlay topologies as inferred from the results. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Debate surrounds the size of the underestimate of nonfatal occupational injuries produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS. We developed models that separated categories of injuries BLS Annual Survey federal government agriculture state and local government self-employed outside agriculture and all other. The models generated varying estimates depending on the assumptions for each category pertaining to job risks and amount of underreporting. We offered justification for the assumptions based on published studies as well as our own analyses of BLS data. The models suggested the Annual Survey missed from 0 to 70 of the number of injuries from private firms excluding the self-employed it was designed to capture. However when we included firms and governments the Annual Survey was not designed to capture and considered reasonable assumptions regarding underreporting we estimated the BLS missed between 33 and 69 of all injuries. We concluded that there was substantial undercapture in the BLS Annual Survey some due to the excluded categories of government workers and the self-employed as well as some due to underreporting.",

This bump may be a signature of interaction between the exploding white dwarf and a nondegenerate binary companion or it may be intrinsic to the white dwarf explosion mechanism. In the case of the former the short duration of the bump implies a relatively compact main-sequence companion star although this conclusion is viewing-angle dependent. Our best-fit companion-shocking and double-detonation models both overpredict the UV luminosity during the bump and existing nickel-shell models do not match the strength and timescale of the bump. We also present nebular spectra of SN 2021aefx which do not show the hydrogen or helium emission expected from a nondegenerate companion as well as a radio nondetection that rules out all symbiotic progenitor systems and most accretion disk winds. Our analysis places strong but conflicting constraints on the progenitor of SN 2021aefx no current model can explain all of our observations.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled blinded cross-over experimental study. ANIMALS A total of eight healthy adult neutered male cats. METHODS Cats were administered five IM treatments at least 2 weeks apart consisting of dexmedetomidine 25 g kg-1 D25 MK-467 600 g kg-1 M600 and D25 combined with 300 600 and 1200 g kg-1 of MK-467 D25M300 D25M600 and D25M1200 respectively. Heart rate and direct arterial blood pressure were recorded via telemetry and sedation assessed prior to treatments and at intervals for 8 hours thereafter. RESULTS Heart rate decreased significantly after all treatments with dexmedetomidine and remained below baseline up to 240 D25 20 D25M300 and 3 minutes D25M600 and D25M1200. Mean arterial pressure MAP increased with D25 remained unchanged with M600 and decreased over time with all combination treatments. The highest and lowest MAP after each treatment were 16817 and 10014 D25 15718 and 7911 D25M300 15311 and 7410 D25M600 14412 and 697 D25M1200 and 1369 and 10413 mmHg M600. All treatments with dexmedetomidine produced sedation although its duration was significantly reduced by the addition of MK-467. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dexmedetomidine induced bradycardia and hypertension which were attenuated by all three doses of MK-467. The duration of sedation was reduced by MK-467. MK-467 may improve the cardiovascular tolerance of IM dexmedetomidine in cats.",

A number of variations of the technique initially described by Deramond have been described including kyphoplasty lordoplasty and device-implanting procedures all of which appear to provide similar pain relief rates as vertebroplasty commonly in the 90 range. Although the effectiveness of vertebroplasty and other vertebral augmentation procedures has been challenged there is significant evidence for its effectiveness.

We present geometric optimization algorithms for the computation of PD with respect to an object-oriented metric S which takes the mass distribution of the moving body X into consideration. We use a kinematic mapping which maps rigid body displacements to points of a 6-dimensional manifold M6 in the 12-dimensional space R12 of affine mappings equipped with S. We formulate PD as the solution of the constrained minimization problem of finding the closest point on the boundary of the set of all points of M6 which correspond to colliding configurations. Based on the theory of gliding motions the closest point with respect to the metric S PDS can be computed with an adapted projected gradient algorithm. We also present an algorithm for the computation of the closest point with respect to the geodesic metric G of M6 induced by S PDG. Moreover we introduce two methods for the computation of a collision-free initial guess and give a physical interpretation of PDS and PDG. 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

All non-English articles were excluded if the corresponding abstract lacked data on demographics initial presentation and clinical management. DATA EXTRACTION After full-text analysis data pertaining to demographics diagnosis medical and surgical management modalities and outcomes were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS Data were qualitatively synthesized and means and averages were obtained for all continuous variables. Overall survival was measured by the Kaplan-Meier method and significance was measured through log-rank testing. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should suspect temporal bone MM in the differential diagnosis of patients with bloody otorrhea in the context of a chronic serous otitis media or an associated cranial nerve palsy. If suspected physicians should not delay the acquisition of a biopsy or imaging studies. Management is highly variable and must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Outcomes remain poor because of the high propensity for MM to metastasize.",

We use two nationally representative datasets the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study TIMSS and the 2005 Korea Education Longitudinal Study KELS and rely on propensity score matching PSM. For adolescent girls we find that being in all-girls schools mitigates both their exposure to and engagement in peer victimization.

    "abstract": "Pacific salmonids cold-water fishes native to the northern hemisphere span a massive geographic range 33 latitude and are exposed to a wide variety of environmental conditions regionally and temporally. California is home to the greatest concentration of at-risk anadromous salmonids and warming river temperatures pose both current and future threats to numerous populations. Thermal standards for management of California populations are currently based on guidelines for multiple salmonid species and from populations across the Pacific Coast. However a growing body of literature suggests that salmonid populations exhibit population-specific thermal requirements. Furthermore in California salmonid populations regularly encounter temperatures that exceed current thermal standards based upon performance of outside populations. This review focuses on Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha providing evidence for interpopulation variation in thermal performance across life stages and explores the drivers of variation. To describe the formation of interpopulation variation we define fundamental and ecological thermal physiologies. Fundamental thermal physiology is the composite of intrinsic physiological traits and abiotic factors that define a species thermal window. Ecological and environmental interactions constrain this fundamental thermal physiology yielding an ecological thermal physiology. Thermal physiology viewed through this lens provides researchers and managers avenues for salmonid research and conservation at the population scale. A more nuanced approach to west-coast salmonid conservation will be required to protect the most at-risk and vulnerable populations. Successful salmonid management must incorporate population-specific traits and present and future watershed conditions.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA-mediated regulation is critical for the proper development and function of the small intestinal SI epithelium. However it is not known which microRNAs are expressed in each of the cell types of the SI epithelium. To bridge this important knowledge gap we performed comprehensive microRNA profiling in all major cell types of the mouse SI epithelium. We used flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting with multiple reporter mouse models to isolate intestinal stem cells enterocytes goblet cells Paneth cells enteroendocrine cells tuft cells and secretory progenitors. We then subjected these cell populations to small RNA-sequencing. The resulting atlas revealed highly enriched microRNA markers for almost every major cell type httpssethupathy-lab.shinyapps.ioSI_miRNA. Several of these lineage-enriched microRNAs LEMs were observed to be embedded in annotated host genes. We used chromatin-run-on sequencing to determine which of these LEMs are likely cotranscribed with their host genes. We then performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to define the cell type specificity of the host genes and embedded LEMs. We observed that the two most enriched microRNAs in secretory progenitors are miR-1224 and miR-672 the latter of which we found is deleted in hominin species. Finally using several in vivo models we established that miR-152 is a Paneth cell-specific microRNA.NEW NOTEWORTHY In this study first microRNA atlas and searchable web server across all major small intestinal epithelial cell types is presented. We have demonstrated microRNAs that uniquely mark several lineages including enteroendocrine and tuft. Identification of a key marker of mouse secretory progenitor cells miR-672 which we show is deleted in humans. We have used several in vivo models to establish miR-152 as a specific marker of Paneth cells which are highly understudied in terms of microRNAs.",

Data from 280 cases from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders are presented. Each case had a complete USSLB staging and at least 1 full research clinical assessment including subspecialty neurologist-administered movement and cognitive evaluation. Of the 280 25.7 were cognitively normal 8.6 had mild cognitive impairment and 65.7 had dementia.

Those with USSLB stages III and IV died at a younger age. Multiple measures of motor parkinsonism cognitive impairment hyposmia and probable RBD were significantly correlated with increasing USSLB stage.

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic centromeres contain long arrays of tandem repeats with unit lengths of 150-300 bp. We searched for such repeats in the functional centromeres of the model legume Medicago truncatula Medicago accession Jemalong A17. To this end three repeats MtR1 MtR2 and MtR3 were identified in 20 Mb of a low-pass whole genome sequencing data set generated by a random shotgun approach. The nucleotide sequence composition genomic organization and abundance of these repeats were characterized. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of these repeats on chromosomes at meiosis I showed that only the MtR3 repeat encompassing stretches of 450 kb to more than 1.0 Mb is located in the functional portion of all eight centromeres. MtR1 and MtR2 occupy distinct regions in pericentromeric heterochromatin. We also studied the presence and distribution of MtRs in Medicago accession R108-1 a genotype with a genome that is 20 smaller than that of Jemalong A17. We determined that while MtR3 is also centromeric on all pachytene bivalents in R108-1 MtR1 and MtR2 are not present in the R108 genome.",

There is more recent literature from Europe. We have observed a high incidence of AA amyloidosis in the county hospital in San Francisco. DESIGN Here we describe 24 patients who had kidney biopsy-proven AA amyloidosis from our hospital from 1998 to 2013. All the patients were thought to have AA amyloidosis from skin popping of illicit drugs after having exhausted the intravenous route. These patients with biopsy-proven AA amyloidosis were analysed further. RESULTS All patients were found to have hepatitis C infection hypertension was not common most had advanced kidney failure and acidosis was common as was tubulointerstitial involvement on the kidney biopsy. Other organ involvement included hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in a number of patients direct myocardial involvement was not seen but pulmonary hypertension history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were common. The prognosis of these patients was poor. The mortality rate approached 50 1 year after biopsy and most of the patient needed dialysis shortly after diagnosis. Cessation of drug use seemed beneficial but rarely achievable. CONCLUSION AA amyloidosis from skin popping is common in San Francisco. Most patients with renal involvement end up on dialysis and mortality rates are exceedingly high.",

    "abstract": "Allometric growth of ducts in the mammary glands MGs is widely held to be estrogen dependent. We previously discovered that the dietary fatty acid trans-10 cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid CLA stimulates estrogen-independent allometric growth and terminal end bud formation in ovariectomized mice. Given the similar phenotype induced by estrogen and CLA we investigated the shared andor divergent mechanisms underlying these changes. We confirmed MG growth induced by CLA is temporally distinct from that elicited by estrogen. We then used RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptome of the MG during similar proliferative and morphological states. Both estrogen and CLA affected the genes involved in proliferation. The transcriptome for estrogen-treated mice included canonical estrogen-induced genes including Pgr Areg and Foxa1. In contrast their expression was unchanged by CLA. However CLA but not estrogen altered expression of a unique set of inflammation-associated genes consistent with stromal changes. This CLA-altered signature included increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR pathway components consistent with the demonstration that CLA-induced MG growth is EGFR dependent. Our findings highlight a unique role for diet-induced inflammation that underlies estrogen-independent MG development.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate for the first time an entirely molecular beam epitaxy MBE approach to high-quality GaAs planar coalescence over embedded dielectric microstructures. Specifically an all-MBE approach was achieved by developing a new two-stage growth process merging the MBE growth regimes of III-flux modulated lateral epitaxial overgrowth LEO with self-ordered planarization of nonplanar substrates to produce highly selective planar coalescence specifically for embedding 010-aligned silica gratings patterned on 001 substrates. The resulting planar coalescence returned a smooth 001 surface with surface roughness as low as 3 nm root-mean-square and photoluminescence PL equivalent to grating-free controls. In demonstrating high-quality GaAs coalescence we also report for the first time an intentionally enhanced single InGaAsGaAsAlAs quantum well PL test structure seamlessly grown directly above embedded silica gratings leading to a 1.4 enhancement in PL as a result of both Purcell and extraction enhancements corroborated by time-resolved PL studies. As a result we provide a significant advance to the long-standing challenge of marrying high-quality semiconductor crystal growth with dielectric microstructures unlocking several high-impact applications such as enhanced quantum emitters and embedded metasurfaces for quantum information processing and provide a pathway for all-MBE metamorphic III-V heteroepitaxy.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS Questionnaire and medical record data from 515 AYA cancer patients 21 acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL 201 germ cell tumor 141 Hodgkin lymphoma 128 non-Hodgkin lymphoma 24 sarcoma from a population-based study were analyzed. We used multivariable models to determine characteristics associated with patient knowledge of the availability of clinical trials for their cancer. Reasons for not participating in a trial were tabulated. RESULTS In total 63 of patients reported not knowing whether a relevant clinical trial was available 20 reported knowing that a clinical trial was not available and 17 reported that a trial was available. Among patients reporting an available trial 67 were recommended for enrollment. Knowing about the availability of clinical trials was associated with having ALL odds ratio2.9 95 confidence interval1.1 7.8. Reporting that a clinical trial was available was positively associated with having ALL Hodgkin lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma and sarcoma relative to germ cell tumor and working full-time or in school full-time odds ratio2.6 95 confidence interval1.0 6.7. Concerns about involvement in research 57 and problems accessing trials 21 were the primary reasons cited for not enrolling among patients who knew that a trial was available.

Studies on the Ca2 sensitivity of force development in porcine cardiac fibers demonstrated that TnT-DeltaK210 caused a significant decrease in Ca2 sensitivity whereas the TnT-R141W did not result in any change in Ca2 sensitivity when compared with human cardiac wild-type TnT HCWTnT. TnT-DeltaK210 also caused a decrease in maximal force when compared with HCWTnT and TnT-R141W. In addition the TnT-DeltaK210 mutant decreased maximal ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2. However the TnT-K273E mutation caused a significant increase in Ca2 sensitivity but behaved similarly to HCWTnT in actomyosin activation assays. Inhibition of ATPase activity in reconstituted actin-activated myosin ATPase assays was similar for all three TnT mutants and HCWTnT. Additionally circular dichroism studies suggest that the secondary structure of all three TnT mutants was similar to that of the HCWTnT.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Cerebral microbleeds CMB represent a common magnetic resonance imaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease increasingly recognized as a subclinical marker of stroke and dementia risk. CMB detection may reflect the cumulative effect of vascular risk burden and be a marker of higher mortality. We investigated the relation of CMB to risk of death in community dwelling participants free of stroke and dementia. METHODS We evaluated 1963 Framingham Original and Offspring Cohort participants mean age 67 years 54 women with available brain magnetic resonance imaging and mortality data. Using Cox proportional hazards models we related CMB to all-cause cardiovascular and stroke-related mortality. RESULTS Participants with CMB 8.9 had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and use of preventive medications. During a mean follow-up of 7.22.6 years we observed 296 deaths. In age- and sex-adjusted analysis CMB were associated with increased all-cause mortality hazards ratio 1.39 95 confidence interval 1.03-1.88 a relation that was no longer significant after adjustment for cardiovascular risk and preventive medication use hazards ratio 1.15 95 confidence interval 0.82-1.63. CONCLUSIONS CMBs may represent the deleterious effect of cardiovascular risk factors in the cerebral vasculature. Although their presence was associated with increased all-cause mortality the effect was no longer present after accounting for vascular risk factors and preventive treatment use. Further studies are required to clarify the role of cardiovascular preventive therapies for prevention of mortality in persons with incidental detection of CMB.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In patients with atrial fibrillation AF and stable ischemic heart disease recent guidelines recommend oral anticoagulant OAC monotherapy in preference to OAC single antiplatelet agent SAPT dual therapy. However these data are based on the results of only two randomized controlled trials RCTs and a relatively small group of patients. Thus the safety and efficacy of this approach may be underpowered to detect a significant difference. We hypothesized that OAC monotherapy will have a reduced risk of bleeding but similar all-cause mortality and ischemic outcomes as compared to dual therapy OAC SAPT. METHODS A systematic search of PubMedMEDLINE EMBASE and Scopus was conducted. Safety outcomes included total bleeding major bleeding and others. Efficacy outcomes included all-cause mortality cardiovascular mortality myocardial infarction stroke and major adverse cardiovascular events MACE. RCTs and observational studies were pooled separately study design stratified meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed for vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants DOACs. Pooled risk ratios RR with corresponding 95 confidence intervals CI were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. RESULTS Meta-analysis of 2 RCTs comprising a total of 2905 patients showed that dual therapy OAC SAPT vs. OAC monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant increase in major bleeding RR 1.51 95 CI 1.10 2.06.

    "abstract": "Bloodstream infection is a serious condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The outcome of these infections can be positively affected by the early implementation of effective antibiotic therapy based on the identification of the infecting organism and genetic markers associated with antibiotic resistance. In this study we evaluated the microarray-based Verigene Gram-negative blood culture BC-GN assay in the identification of 8 genus or species targets and 6 genetic resistance determinants in positive blood culture broths. A total of 1847 blood cultures containing Gram-negative organisms were tested using the BC-GN assay. This comprised 729 prospective fresh 781 prospective or retrospective frozen and 337 simulated cultures representing 7 types of aerobic culture media. The results were compared to those with standard bacterial culture and biochemical identification with nucleic acid sequence confirmation of the resistance determinants. Among monomicrobial cultures the positive percent agreement PPA of the BC-GN assay with the reference method was as follows Escherichia coli 100 Klebsiella pneumoniae 92.9 Klebsiella oxytoca 95.5 Enterobacter spp. 99.3 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 98.9 Proteus spp. 100 Acinetobacter spp. 98.4 and Citrobacter spp. 100. All organism identification targets demonstrated 99.5 negative percent agreement NPA with the reference method. Of note 2526 cultures containing K. pneumoniae that were reported as not detected by the BC-GN assay were subsequently identified as Klebsiella variicola. The PPA for identification of resistance determinants was as follows blaCTX-M 98.9 blaKPC 100 blaNDM 96.2 blaOXA 94.3 blaVIM 100 and blaIMP 100. All resistance determinant targets demonstrated 99.9 NPA. Among polymicrobial specimens the BC-GN assay correctly identified at least one organism in 95.4 of the broths and correctly identified all organisms present in 54.5 of the broths. The sample-to-result processing and automated reading of the detection microarray results enables results within 2 h of culture positivity.",

Prior theorizing and research in communication has primarily addressed Marrs computational level why but has less frequently investigated algorithmic what or implementation how all communication phenomena emerge from and rely on biological processes explanations. Here we introduce Marrs framework and apply it to three research domains in communication science-audience research persuasion and social comparisons-to demonstrate what a unifying framework for explaining communication across the levels of why what and how can look like and how Marrs framework speaks to and receives input from all subfields of communication inquiry.",

It is shown that by inserting an observer in the inputoutput relationship associated with the dynamical system a QMC approach can be developed that is applicable to systems with marginally stable or unstable equilibrium points. A system of equations governing all linear state-space realizations along with the corresponding observers is derived from matching a set of Markov and Covariance parameters. The solution to this equation system is shown to parameterize all state-space realizations that match the pre-specified correlation functions. Four numerical examples are used to show the utility of the proposed approach. The numerical results show that the observer-based QMC presented in the paper can identify linear SISO and MIMO systems with stable marginally stable and unstable characteristics.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of the neurovascular coupling relationship requires the simultaneous measurement of neuronal and vascular responses and the capability to probe all layers of the cerebral cortex. Current macroscopic imaging techniques like laser Doppler imaging diffuse optical tomography fMRI and PET lack spatial resolution. While two-photon microscopy is widely used in imaging the brain it suffers from a lack of depth penetration and imaging speed. Optical coherence tomography OCT provides a platform for imaging the brain that potentially overcomes all of the above disadvantages providing high-resolution cross-sectional images of light backscattered from cortical tissue. Here we outline the experimental methods involved in simultaneous OCT hemodynamic and electrophysiological neuronal measurements to investigate neurovascular coupling in the rat somatosensory cortex. Using a spectral Fourier domain OCT system changes in cerebral blood flow and scattering were measured from multiple cortical layers. Simultaneous neuronal responses from layer IV using a tungsten microelectrode and surface potentials from a fire-polished ball electrode were also measured. This chapter provides details on animal preparation instrumental setup and data acquisition methods and finally discusses potential limitations and pitfalls.",

    "abstract": "Chronic injury to the liver leads to inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis which when untreated can lead to myofibroblast activation and fibrogenesis with deposition of fibrous tissue. Over time liver fibrosis can accumulate and lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease with associated portal hypertension and liver failure. Detection and accurate measurement of the severity of liver fibrosis are important for assessing disease severity and progression directing patient management and establishing prognosis. Liver biopsy generally considered the clinical standard of reference for detecting and measuring liver fibrosis is invasive and has limitations including sampling error relatively high cost and possible complications. For these reasons liver biopsy is suboptimal for fibrosis screening longitudinal monitoring and assessing therapeutic efficacy. A variety of established and emerging qualitative and quantitative noninvasive MRI methods for detecting and staging liver fibrosis might ultimately serve these purposes. In this article we review multiple MRI methods for detecting and measuring liver fibrosis and discuss the diagnostic performance and specific strengths and limitations of the various techniques.",

The evidence to date suggests that this neither improved nor worsened patient outcomes. In June 2010 the ACGME proposed a new set of duty-hour standards for implementation in July 2011. The main disadvantage of this approach is that there is no ability to determine whether different standards would have worked better to reduce resident fatigue while improving patient safety. Many unanswered questions remain about how to design duty-hour standards but relatively little evidence exists. In addition the same approach may not work in all specialties and all hospitals. A more flexible dynamic policy that emphasizes ongoing testing and evaluation would be more likely to achieve improvements in clinical and educational outcomes.",

Adults of rolledleaf hispine beetles Chrysomelidae Coleoptera spend their lives in the scrolls formed by immature leaves of Heliconia Heliconiaceae Monocotyledonae in Tropical America. As many as eight hispine species can intermingle in the host scrolls at a single site. Scrolls of single host species are invariably occupied by adults of more than one hispine species and as many as five species can simultaneously occupy one scroll. 2. I made virgin scrolls which had never contained any insects by growing leaves under the cover of plastic bags. 3. Thirtyseven combinations of single hispine and Heliconia species were experimentally created in the virgin scrolls at two sites and in two seasons in Costa Rica. Combinations included all abundant host species at the sites. 4. All beetles left all leaves of the twentyeight unnatural beetlehost combinations within 24 h. On the other hand none of the nine natural combinations was completely abandoned within the experimental period. 5. Thus host specificity is not broader in the absence of similar hispine species that might be competitors and interspecies competition does not affect this obvious aspect of resource utilization for these phytophagous insects.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Children with radial longitudinal deficiency have very short forearms. The Ilizarov method of distraction osteogenesis has been used to increase extremity length but results differ with the underlying condition and the limb being lengthened. The purpose of this study is to examine retrospectively the outcomes of Ilizarov lengthening of the ulna in children with radial longitudinal deficiency. METHODS Nine children with radial longitudinal deficiency had 13 ulnar lengthenings using the Ilizarov method 8 with unilateral deficiency had 9 lengthenings to improve appearance and 1 child with bilateral radial longitudinal deficiency had 4 lengthenings to improve function. All had previous wrist centralization surgery and all but 1 had a carpal osteotomy at the time of lengthening to reduce residual wrist angulation. RESULTS The average gain for each lengthening was 4.4 cm range 1.8-8.0 cm with an average lengthening index of 9 weeks per cm range 4-24 weeks per cm. All patients at each lengthening experienced at least 1 pin site infection that required antibiotic treatment. Other complications included delayed union requiring internal fixation and bone grafting in 3 lengthenings and recurrence of radial deviation requiring shortening and wrist arthrodesis in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS The Ilizarov technique is an effective method for lengthening the ulna in children with radial longitudinal deficiency. The process of lengthening is prolonged and arduous with frequent complications. In successful cases however patients are pleased with the function and appearance of their lengthened forearms.",

    "abstract": "Plant defensins are small basic peptides that have a characteristic three-dimensional folding pattern which is stabilized by four disulfide bridges. We show here that Arabidopsis contains in addition to the proper plant defensins a group of 9 plant defensin-like PdfL genes. They are all expressed at low levels while GUS fusions of the promoters showed expression in most tissues with only minor differences. We produced two of the encoded peptides in E. coli and tested the antimicrobial activity in vitro. Both were highly active against fungi but had lower activity against bacteria. At higher concentrations hyperbranching and swollen tips which are indicative of antimicrobial activity were induced in Fusarium graminearum by both peptides. Overexpression lines for most PdfL genes were produced using the 35S CaMV promoter to study their possible in planta function. With the exception of PdfL4.1 these lines had enhanced resistance against F. oxysporum. All PDFL peptides were also transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves with agroinfiltration using the pPZP3425 vector. In case of PDFL1.4 this resulted in complete death of the infiltrated tissues after 7 days. All other PDFLs resulted only in various degrees of small necrotic lesions. In conclusion our results show that at least some of the PdfL genes could function in plant resistance.",

The NIRS measurements are performed at five discrete wavelengths in a spectral window of 650-850 nm and MIRI is performed in a spectral window of 8-12 microm. The understanding of tissue oxygenation status and the behavior of the physiological parameters derived from thermometry may provide a useful insight into muscle physiology therapeutic response and treatment.",

The interval containing the SMA gene has been defined by linkage analysis as 5qcen-D5S435-SMA-D5S557-5qter. We have isolated a new dinucleotide repeat marker CATT1 that lies between these two closest markers. The marker CATT1 has 16 alleles and is highly polymorphic. The marker can have 1 to 4 or more copies per chromosome giving rise to individuals with up to 8 or more alleles. All of the subloci map between the markers D5S557 and D5S435 and lie in close proximity to one another. The marker CATT1 is linked to the SMA gene with a lod score of Zmax 34.42 at theta 0 and crosses all available recombinants. Certain alleles occurred more frequently in either the SMA or normal populations indicating significant allelic association between CATT1 and the SMA locus. Haplotype analysis combining U.S. and Canadian SMA families reveals that one haplotype group VII occurs significantly more frequently in the SMA population than in the normal. This confirms the allelic association of CATT1 with the SMA locus.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To describe the scope and outcomes of elective pediatric surgical procedures performed during combat operations. BACKGROUND The care of patients in Operation Enduring Freedom OEF includes elective humanitarian surgery on Afghan children. Unlike military reports of pediatric trauma care there is little outcome data on elective pediatric surgical care during combat operations to guide treatment decisions. METHODS All elective surgical procedures performed on patients16years of age from May 2012 through April 2014 were reviewed. Procedures were grouped by surgical specialty and were further classified as single-stage SINGLE or multi-stage MULTI. The primary endpoint was post-operative complications requiring further surgery and the secondary endpoint was post-operative follow up. RESULTS A total of 311 elective pediatric surgical procedures were performed on 239 patients. Surgical specialties included general surgery orthopedics otolaryngology ophthalmology neurosurgery and urology. 178 57 were SINGLE while 133 43 were MULTI. Fifteen patients required 32 procedures for post-operative complications. Approximately half of all procedures were performed as outpatient surgery. Median length of stay for inpatient was 2.2days and all patients survived to discharge. The majority of patients returned for outpatient follow-up 207 87 and 4 patients 1.7 died after discharge. CONCLUSIONS Elective pediatric surgical care in a forward deployed setting is feasible however limitations in resources for perioperative care and rehabilitation mandate prudent patient selection particularly with respect to procedures that require prolonged post-operative care. Formal guidance on the process of patient selection for elective humanitarian surgery in these settings is needed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND While there is increasing recognition of the risks associated with hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes few studies have investigated incident cause-specific cardiovascular outcomes with regard to low fasting glucose in the general population. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that low fasting glucose would be associated with cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality in postmenopausal women. METHODS To test our hypothesis we used both continuous incidence rates and Cox proportional hazards models in 17287 participants from the Womens Health Initiative with fasting glucose measured at baseline. Participants were separated into groups based on fasting glucose level low 80mgdL normalreference 80-99mgdL impaired 100-125mgdL and diabetic 126mgdL. RESULTS Participants were free of cardiovascular disease at enrollment had mean age of 62years and were 52 Caucasian 24 African American 8 Asian and 12 Hispanic. Median follow-up was 15years. Graphs of continuous incidence rates compared to fasting glucose distribution exhibited evidence of a weak J-shaped association with heart failure and mortality that was predominantly due to participants with treated diabetes. Impaired and diabetic fasting glucose were positively associated with all outcomes. Associations for low fasting glucose differed with coronary heart disease HR0.64 0.42 0.98 significantly inverse stroke 0.73 0.48 1.13 combined cardiovascular disease 0.91 0.73 1.14 and all-cause mortality 0.97 0.79 1.20 null or inverse and not significant and heart failure 1.27 0.80 2.02 positive and not significant. CONCLUSIONS Fasting glucose at the upper range but not the lower range was significantly associated with incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.",

All cultivars can be affected by the HLB-associated bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus CLas and there is no known resistance. Insight into HLB pathogenesis is urgently needed in order to develop effective management strategies. Here we use Sec-delivered effector 1 SDE1 which is conserved in all CLas isolates as a molecular probe to understand CLas virulence. We show that SDE1 directly interacts with citrus papain-like cysteine proteases PLCPs and inhibits protease activity. PLCPs are defense-inducible and exhibit increased protein accumulation in CLas-infected trees suggesting a role in citrus defense responses. We analyzed PLCP activity in field samples revealing specific members that increase in abundance but remain unchanged in activity during infection. SDE1-expressing transgenic citrus also exhibit reduced PLCP activity. These data demonstrate that SDE1 inhibits citrus PLCPs which are immune-related proteases that enhance defense responses in plants.",

    "abstract": "The cytochromes P450 form an enormous family of over 20 000 enzyme variants found in all branches of life. They catalyze the O2 dependent monooxygenation of a wide range of substrates in reactions important to drug metabolism biosynthesis and energy utilization. Understanding how they function is important for biomedical science and requires a full description of their notorious propensity for specificity and promiscuity. The bacterial P450cam is an unusual example having the most well characterized chemical mechanism of all of the forms. It also undergoes an increasingly well characterized structural change upon substrate binding which may be similar to to that displayed by some but not all forms of P450. Finally P450cam is one of the rare forms that have a strict requirement for a particular electron donor putidaredoxin pdx. Pdx provides the required electrons for enzyme turnover but it also induces specific changes in the enzyme to allow enzyme turnover long known as its effector role. This review summarizes recent crystallographic and double electron-electron resonance studies that have revealed the effects of substrate and pdx binding on the structure of P450cam. We describe an emerging idea for how pdx exerts its effector function by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme. This change then propagates to the active site to enable cleavage of the ferric-hydroperoxy bond during catalysis and appears to provide a very elegant approach for P450cam to attain both high efficiency and protection from oxidative damage.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Infants who do not pass their newborn hearing screen require diagnostic follow-up visits but often face access barriers such as travel distance and shortage of pediatric audiologists. Telemedicine tele-audiology is a potential solution to provide diagnostic hearing evaluations for families of infants facing access barriers. We determined the feasibility and impact of a tele-audiology program that provided comprehensive diagnostic evaluations to a region with a high lost to follow-up rate among newborns who did not pass their newborn hearing screen. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated the tele-audiology program using parent and provider surveys to determine the perception of quality and satisfaction of care. We also compared the lost to follow-up rate of the tele-audiology program with the loss to follow-up in the region before the implementation of the program. RESULTS Twenty-two infants who did not pass their newborn hearing screen were referred to the tele-audiology program for diagnostic evaluation. Among these infants 59.1 were diagnosed with some form of hearing loss. The mean quality score rated by both parents and providers on the telemedicine interaction was over 6.5 on a 7-point Likert scale. All parents rated the importance of tele-audiology as 7 extremely important for their family whereas the provider rated the mean importance as 6.4 95 confidence interval 5.9 6.9 on a 7-point Likert scale. Almost all parents actively participated or were engaged during history taking and counseling and were comfortable in discussing their childs hearing status remotely over telemedicine. All infants completed their diagnostic evaluation with no loss to follow-up compared with 22 loss to follow-up in the region before the implementation of the program. CONCLUSIONS Tele-audiology is a feasible solution that reduces the loss to follow-up among infants who do not pass their newborn hearing screen and have access barriers to qualified audiologists for diagnostic evaluations.",

Yet not all are aware of the specificities of their contributions and in position to feel proud and communicate the value proposition of the geoscience professions to society at large. Several initiatives have elevated consciousness about the geosciences contributions and potential but none do so expansively. The most notable effort to date is the Geophysical Sustainability Atlas Capello et al. 2021 which raised the awareness about the importance of geophysics in the pursuit of each of the 17 SDGs and triggered an enhanced vision about the pivotal role of geophysicists in advancing sustainability. This article shares our teams progress in creating a more comprehensive atlas that aims to engage all the geosciences and will communicate to a larger audience how geoscientists advance sustainability in their daily work. The aim of the Geosciences Sustainability Atlas is to motivate geoscientists and society at large to comprehend why and how geoscientists are huge contributors to sustainability and need to be part of the sustainability narrative. By disclosing how these multinational multidisciplinary volunteer initiatives are being shaped we hope to foster the proliferation of similar projects.",

    "abstract": "Pokmon Go is a new game that encourages players to venture outdoors and interact with others in the pursuit of virtual Pokmon characters. With more time spent outdoors overall and in sometimes large congregations Pokmon Go players could inadvertently elevate their risk of exposure to mosquito-borne diseases when playing in certain areas at certain times of year. Here we make an initial assessment of the possible scope of this concern in the continental United States which experiences its highest seasonal transmission of West Nile Zika and other viruses during summer and early fall. In particular we propose that the times of day when many disease-relevant mosquito species are most likely to engage in blood feeding coincide with times of day when Pokmon Go activity is likely to be high and we note that locations serving as hubs of Pokmon Go activity may in some cases overlap with areas where these mosquitoes are actively engaged in blood feeding. Although the risk of mosquito-borne diseases in the continental U.S. is low overall and is unlikely to be impacted significantly by Pokmon Go it is nonetheless important for Pokmon Go players and others who spend time outdoors engaging in activities such as barbecues and gardening to be aware of these ongoing risks and to take appropriate preventative measures in light of the potential for outdoor activity to modify individual-level risk of exposure. As Pokmon Go and other augmented reality games become available in other parts of the world similar risks should be assessed in a manner that is consistent with the local epidemiology of mosquito-borne diseases in those areas.",

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the PED as a primary treatment for ruptured aneurysms with challenging morphologies. METHODS Three patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms presented with SAH. Three distinct and difficult-to-treat aneurysm morphologies were encountered 1 a small basilar trunk pseudoaneurysm 2 a carotid artery blister aneurysm and 3 an A1A2 junction-dissecting-type aneurysm. All were treated with deployment of one or more PEDs across the aneurysm. RESULTS PEDs were successfully deployed in all 3 cases. Two patients were treated with 2 overlapping PEDs and the third patient was treated with a single device. Aneurysm obliteration was achieved in all 3 cases with no early rehemorrhage or other clinically adverse event. CONCLUSION Endovascular treatment with the pipeline flow-diverting stent may be a viable treatment option for otherwise difficult-to-treat aneurysm morphologies in the context of acute SAH.",

Over 95 of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas which are typically classified based on anatomic location and histologic type. Gastric cancer generally carries a poor prognosis because it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Systemic therapy can provide palliation improved survival and enhanced quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. The implementation of biomarker testing especially analysis of HER2 status microsatellite instability MSI status and the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 PD-L1 has had a significant impact on clinical practice and patient care. Targeted therapies including trastuzumab nivolumab and pembrolizumab have produced encouraging results in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Palliative management which may include systemic therapy chemoradiation andor best supportive care is recommended for all patients with unresectable or metastatic cancer.

This is understood in terms of an extended notion of positivity in G2 n the Grassmannian of 2-planes in n dimensions a single on-shell diagram can be associated with many different positive regions of which the familiar G2 n associated with planar diagrams is just one example. The decomposition into Parke-Taylor factors is simply a triangulation of these extended positive regions. The U1 decoupling and Kleiss-Kuijf KK relations satisfied by the Parke-Taylor amplitudes also follow naturally from this geometric picture. These results suggest that non-planar MHV amplitudes in N4 mathcalN4 SYM at all loop orders can be expressed as a sum of polylogarithms weighted by color factors and unordered Parke-Taylor amplitudes.",

In the context of supersymmetric theories with minimal low energy field content we discuss which fermion masses and mixings may be obtained radiatively and find that constraints from flavor-changing phenomenology imply that only the first generation fermion masses and some but not all CKM mixings can naturally come from radiative corrections. We also consider general conditions on theories of flavor which guarantee the existence of tree-level massless fermions while having nontrivial CKM matrix elements at the tree level. Two complete models of flavor are presented. In the first model all first generation fermion masses are radiatively generated. In the second model the electron and up quark mass are due to radiative corrections whereas the down mass appears at the tree level as does a successful prediction for the Cabibbo angle Formula presented. 1996 The American Physical Society.",

Bicycling now accounts for less than 1 percent of all trips for all purposes in the U.

S. cities suggest that it is possible to create conditions conducive to higher levels of bicycling even in the U. S. However the extent to which bicycle investments have contributed to bicycling levels in these communities has not been rigorously assessed. The purpose of this study is to provide a better understanding of the determinants of bicycle ownership and use as a basis for identifying ways to promote bicycling. A cross-sectional study of six cities was designed to test the importance of bicycle infrastructure and other physical environment factors relative to individual factors and social environment factors using a nested logit model to examine ownership and use decisions jointly. The results show strong effects of individual attitudes and physical and social environment factors on bicycle ownership and use. 2010 The Authors.",

    "abstract": "Jasmonates are derived from oxygenated fatty acids oxylipins via the octadecanoid pathway and are characterized by a pentacyclic ring structure. They have regulatory functions as signaling molecules in plant development and adaptation to environmental stress. Recently we solved the structure of allene oxide cyclase 2 AOC2 of Arabidopsis thaliana which is together with the other three AOCs a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of jasmonates in that it releases the first cyclic and biologically active metabolite -- 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid OPDA. On the basis of models for the bound substrate 1213S-epoxy-9Z1115Z-octadecatrienoic acid and the product OPDA we proposed that a conserved Glu promotes the reaction by anchimeric assistance. According to this hypothesis the transition state with a pentadienyl carbocation and an oxyanion is stabilized by a strongly bound water molecule and favorable pi-pi interactions with aromatic residues in the cavity. Stereoselectivity results from steric restrictions to the necessary substrate isomerizations imposed by the protein environment. Here site-directed mutagenesis was used to explore and verify the proposed reaction mechanism. In a comparative analysis of the AOC family from A. thaliana involving enzymatic characterization in vitro import and transient expression of AOC-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion proteins for analysis of subcellular targeting we demonstrate that all four AOC isoenzymes may contribute to jasmonate biosynthesis as they are all located in chloroplasts and in concert with the allene oxide synthase they are all able to convert 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z11E15Z-octadecatrienoic acid into enantiomerically pure cis-OPDA.",

    "abstract": "Evolution by natural selection the unifying theory of all biological sciences provides a basis for understanding how phenotypic variability is generated at all levels of organization from genes to behavior. However it is important to distinguish what is the target of selection vs. what is transmitted across generations. Physical traits behaviors and the extended phenotype are all selected features of an individual but genes that covary with different aspects of the targets of selection are inherited. Here we review the variability in cortical organization morphology and behavior that have been observed across species and describe similar types of variability within species. We examine sources of variability and the constraints that limit the types of changes that evolution has and can produce. Finally we underscore the importance of how genes and genetic regulatory networks are deployed and interact within an individual and their relationship to external physical forces within the environment that shape the ultimate phenotype.",

    "abstract": "In the thin film limit the surface state of a three-dimensional topological insulator gives rise to two parallel conduction channels at the top and bottom surface of the film which are difficult to disentangle in transport experiments. Here we present gate-dependent multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope transport measurements combined with photoemission experiments all performed in situ on pristine BiSbTe3 thin films. To analyze the data we develop a generic transport model including quantum capacitance effects. This approach allows us to quantify the gate-dependent conductivities charge carrier concentrations and mobilities for all relevant transport channels of three-dimensional topological insulator thin films i.e. the two topological surface state channels as well as the interior of the film. For the present sample we find that the conductivity in the bottom surface state channel is minimized below a gate voltage of Vgate 34 V and the top surface state channel dominates the transport through the film.",

    "abstract": "Different approaches have investigated the effects of different extracellular matrices ECMs and three-dimensional 3D culture on islet function showing encouraging results. Ideally the proper scaffold should mimic the biochemical composition of the native tissue as it drives numerous signaling pathways involved in tissue homeostasis and functionality. Tissue-derived decellularized biomaterials can preserve the ECM composition of the native tissue making it an ideal scaffold for 3D tissue engineering applications. However the decellularization process may affect the retention of specific components and the choice of a proper detergent is fundamental in preserving the native ECM composition. In this study we evaluated the effect of different decellularization protocols on the mechanical properties and biochemical composition of pancreatic ECM pECM hydrogels. Fresh porcine pancreas tissue was harvested cut into small pieces rinsed in water and treated with two different detergents sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS or Triton X-100 for 1 day followed by 3 days in water. Effective decellularization was confirmed by PicoGreen assay Hoescht and HE staining showing no differences among groups. Use of a protease inhibitor PI was also evaluated. Effective decellularization was confirmed by PicoGreen assay and hematoxylin and eosin HE staining showing no differences among groups. Triton-treated samples were able to form a firm hydrogel under appropriate conditions while the use of SDS had detrimental effects on the gelation properties of the hydrogels. ECM biochemical composition was characterized both in the fresh porcine pancreas and all decellularized pECM hydrogels by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. Fibrillar collagen was the major ECM component in all groups with all generated hydrogels having a higher amount compared with fresh pancreas. This effect was more pronounced in the SDS-treated hydrogels when compared with the Triton groups showing very little retention of other ECM molecules. Conversely basement membrane and matricellular proteins were better retained when the tissue was pretreated with a PI and decellularized in Triton X-100 making the hydrogel more similar to the native tissue. In conclusion we showed that all the protocols evaluated in the study showed effective tissue decellularization but only when the tissue was pretreated with a PI and decellularized in Triton detergent the biochemical composition of the hydrogel was closer to the native tissue ECM. Impact Statement The article compares different methodologies for the generation of a pancreas-derived hydrogel for tissue engineering applications. The biochemical characterization of the newly generated hydrogel shows that the material retains all the extracellular molecules of the native tissue and is capable of sustaining functionality of the encapsulated beta-cells.",

The American College of Surgeons Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program MBSAQIP set out to create a publicly available tool to assess both short-term postoperative risk and long-term benefits for prospective adult patients eligible for 1 of 4 primary bariatric procedures. The calculator is comprised of multiple prediction elements 1 30-day postoperative risk 2 1-year body mass index projections and 3 1-year comorbidity remission. OBJECTIVES To assess the performance of the 1-year comorbidity remission prediction feature of the calculator. SETTING Not-for-profit organization clinical data registry. METHODS MBSAQIP data across 4.5 years from 240227 total patients indicating at least 1 comorbidity of interest present preoperatively and who had a 1-year follow-up record documenting their comorbidity status were included. Six models were constructed stratified by the presence of the respective preoperative comorbidity hypertension hyperlipidemia gastroesophageal reflux disease sleep apnea non-insulin-dependent diabetes and insulin-dependent diabetes. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to predict 1-year remission total partial or no remission of insulin-dependent diabetes. All other outcomes were binary yes or no at 1 yr and ordinary logistic regression models were used. RESULTS All models showed adequate discrimination C statistics ranging from .58 to .68. Plots of observed versus predicted remission showed excellent calibration across all models. CONCLUSION All remission models were well calibrated with sufficient discrimination. The MBSAQIP Bariatric Surgical RiskBenefit Calculator is a publicly available tool intended for integration into clinical practice to enhance patient-clinician discussions and informed consent.",

In South Africa male phallosome DVD ratio male maxillary palp index branching of siphonal seta 1a the enzyme locus Mdhp-1 and W. pipientis infection rates proved highly diagnostic for separating Culex quinquefasciatus from Cx. pipiens phenotypes. In Johannesburg where sympatric members of the Cx. pipiens complex were analyzed as one population a significant Wahlund Effect was observed in the enzyme loci such as Ao 6-Pgdh Mdh-2 and Pgm. In California all populations of the Cx. pipiens complex were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium at all polymorphic enzyme loci examined. Additionally in California all populations had similar W. pipientis infection rates and appeared morphologically identical except for DVD ratio in extreme north and south. These findings indicate that in South Africa Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus remain as genetically distinct populations and behave as separate species. Conversely in California there is considerable genetic introgression between Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus and they behave as a single species.",

These types of competition are ubiquitous during language production. In this work we investigate the neural mechanisms that allow individuals to effectively manage these cognitive control demands and to quickly choose words with few errors. Using fMRI we directly contrast underdetermined and prepotent competition within the same task verb generation for the first time allowing localization of the neural substrates supporting the resolution of these two types of competition. Using a neural network model we investigate the possible mechanisms by which these brain regions support selection. Together our findings demonstrate that all competition is not alike resolving prepotent competition and resolving underdetermined competition rely on partly dissociable neural substrates and mechanisms. Specifically activation of left ventrolateral pFC is specific to resolving underdetermined competition between multiple appropriate responses most likely via competitive lateral inhibition. In contrast activation of left dorsolateral pFC is sensitive to both underdetermined competition and prepotent competition from response options that are inappropriate in the current context. This region likely provides top-down support for task-relevant responses which enables them to out-compete prepotent responses in the selection process that occurs in left ventrolateral pFC.",

This report describes the findings of the first phase of a National Institute of Health Office of Research on Womens Health NIH ORWH-funded study using survey and academic data for exploring satisfaction and awareness ofintent to use specific career flexibility options at the University of California Davis UCD. METHODS All men and women faculty in the UCDs Schools of Medicine SOM and Veterinary Medicine SVM and College of Biological Science CBS were surveyed. Data also were obtained from deans offices on use of family-friendly benefits by faculty. RESULTS Three hundred twenty-five total survey responses were received from the SOM 83 from SVM and 64 from CBS representing 42 46 and 52 of their total faculty respectively. In each school large percentages of men 32-60 and women 46-53 faculty have children under 18 and a moderately high level of demand of family care responsibilities. Women were significantly more likely to be childless particularly in the SOM 35 vs. 14 p0.001. For all schools documented use of any family-friendly policy was low 0-11.5 as was awareness of policies although both were significantly higher for women than for men. Significantly more women than men wanted to use policies or chose not to particularly in the SOM 51 vs. 28 p0.001 and 37 vs. 23 p0.016 respectively because of multiple barriers. Faculty in all schools agreedhighly agreed that policies were important to recruitment retention and career advancement. CONCLUSIONS Family-friendly policies are pertinent to men and women as both demonstrate interest and need linked to increased career satisfaction. A family-friendly policy is important particularly for women in the biomedical sciences.",

In human MF neoplastic cells are phenotypically consistent with resident effector memory T cells a population that remains for an extended period within tissue without circulating. Dogs with eCTCL often present with lesions in multiple locations raising the question of whether the neoplasm is of the same T-cell subpopulation or not. OBJECTIVES To characterize the antigen receptor gene rearrangements of lymphocytes from skin and blood of dogs with eCTCL to determine if neoplastic clones are identical. ANIMALS Fourteen dogs with eCTCL. MATERIALS AND METHODS Histological and immunohistochemical examination and PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement PARR for T-cell receptor gamma TRG performed on multiple cutaneous biopsy samples and blood. RESULTS All skin biopsies contained cluster of differentiation CD3-positive neoplastic lymphocytes. Within individual dogs all skin biopsies revealed identical TRG clonality profiles suggesting that the same neoplastic clone was present in all sites. In the blood a matching clone was found in six of 14 dogs a unique clone was observed in nine of 14 dogs and no clone was detected in two of 14 dogs. CONCLUSIONS These findings show that canine eCTCL lesions in multiple locations harbour the same neoplastic clone neoplastic lymphocytes do not remain fixed to the skin and instead can circulate via blood differing clones can be identified in skin versus blood and circulating neoplastic cells can be detected without lymphocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Almost all processes -- highly correlated weakly correlated or correlated not at all---exhibit statistical fluctuations. Often physical laws such as the Second Law of Thermodynamics address only typical realizations -- as highlighted by Shannons asymptotic equipartition property and as entailed by taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Indeed our interpretations of the functioning of macroscopic thermodynamic cycles are so focused. Using a recently derived Second Law for information processing we show that different subsets of fluctuations lead to distinct thermodynamic functioning in Maxwellian Demons. For example while typical realizations may operate as an engine -- converting thermal fluctuations to useful work -- even nearby fluctuations nontypical but probable realizations behave differently as Landauer erasers -- converting available stored energy to dissipate stored information. One concludes that ascribing a single unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system especially one on the nanoscale is at best misleading likely masking an array of simultaneous parallel thermodynamic transformations. This alters how we conceive of cellular processes engineering design and evolutionary adaptation.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the two popular medium rice varieties namely M202 and M206 in California have different fissuring resistances. Therefore the main goal of this study was to investigate the sorption behavior of these two varieties by a new approach using dynamic vapor sorption DVS method for elucidating the differences in fissuring resistance. The moisture sorption isotherms of rough brown and white rice and husk were determined at 25 C over a water activity range of 0-0.98. Although it was found that the sorption isotherms of different forms of M202 and M206 were similar M202 absorbed and desorbed moisture faster than M206 which might make it more susceptible to fissuring. All obtained moisture sorption isotherms exhibited the sigmoid Type II shape and hysteresis was observed for all forms of rice. Absorption curves obtained using DVS method were compared with the traditional saturated salt solution SSS method. For all forms of rice the maximum difference for equilibrium moisture content value between two methods was observed at 0 and 98 relative humidities which was approximately 8-11 and 7-9. Although at a single relative humidity point equilibrium with DVS was attained much faster than SSS method obtaining a full isotherm with more than 10 data points might make SSS method more feasible for low diffusion materials. Among the select equations to describe sorption behavior of different forms of rice Peleg equation gave the best fit for all forms of rice. 2012.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND This study evaluates screening practices and the incidence of associated anomalies in infants with anorectal malformations ARM. METHODS We performed a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of children born between 2007 and 2011 who underwent surgery for ARM at 10 childrens hospitals. ARM type was classified based on the location of the distal rectum and all screening studies were reviewed. RESULTS Among 506 patients the most common ARM subtypes were perineal fistula 40.7 no fistula 11.5 and vestibular fistula 10.1. At least 1 screening test was performed in 96.6 of patients and 11.3 of patients underwent all. The proportion of patients with 1 abnormal finding on any screening test varied by type of ARM p0.001. Screening rates varied from 15.2 for limb anomalies to 89.7 for renal anomalies. The most commonly identified anomalies by screening category were spinal tethered cord 20.6 vertebral sacral dysplasiahemisacrum 17.8 cardiac patent foramen ovale 58.0 renal hydronephrosis 22.7 limb absent radius 7.9. CONCLUSION Screening practices and the incidence of associated anomalies varied by type of ARM. The rate of identifying at least one associated anomaly was high across all ARM subtypes. Screening for associated anomalies should be considered standard of care for all ARM patients. TYPE OF STUDY Multi-institutional retrospective cohort study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III.",

    "abstract": "The use of household cleaning products and air fresheners exposes people to a variety of chemicals including some that have been shown to be irritants potential carcinogens and endocrine disrupting compounds. In addition some react with ambient ozone infiltrating to the indoor environment to form potentially toxic secondary pollutants. Although realistic estimates of usage patterns are necessary for modeling potential exposures in risk assessments few studies have documented cleaning habits and product usage to characterize how they vary between households and over time. In addition understanding within-household temporal variability of use is important to assess the reliability of exposure questionnaires used in epidemiological surveys and improve the cost-efficiency of data collection. In the SUPERB Study of Use of Products and Exposure-Related Behavior study frequencies of use of eight types of household cleaning products and air fresheners and the performance of different types of cleaning tasks are collected in three annual telephone and six quarterly web-based surveys. All-purpose and glass cleaners were the products most frequently used among all products surveyed. Use frequencies differed by demographic and other household characteristics for some products. Product usage was internally consistent with over 75 of pairwise cross-sectional correlations between product types statistically significantly different from zero. In addition each product type was correlated with at least one cleaning habit. Frequency of cleaning product use and performing cleaning tasks did not vary by season. An examination of intra-household variability showed moderately to highly consistent usage patterns over time with lower temporal consistency observed among products used more frequently such as all-purpose cleaners. Frequency of household care product usage was consistent enough that in epidemiologic studies participants can be classified for example into three categories on the basis of a single assessment with only minimal misclassification. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Marvdasht and wild barley Hordeum spontaneum. The cumulative emergence and plant height gain over time were modeled with the use of a logistic function. For a particular temperature regime the maximum percentage emergence Emax of wheat was higher than that of wild barley across all sowing depths. The maximum and minimum Emax values for both species occurred at 2015C and 2520C respectively. The time taken to reach 50 of the Emax i.e. E50 increased with the sowing depth in both species under all temperature regimes. The E50 of wild barley was greater than that of wheat for all temperature regimes with maximum differences observed at 2015C. The greatest maximum plant height Hmax was observed at the surface planting for both plants. The Hmax was reduced at temperatures either lower or higher than 2015C with a more notable reduction in wild barley. At all temperature regimes the time taken to reach 50 of the Hmax i.e. H50 increased linearly with the sowing depth but at higher temperatures the accelerated growth rate reduced the H50. The wild barley seedling emergence and height gain rate as expressed relative to those of wheat revealed the highest superiority of wheat over wild barley at 2520C and the sowing depth of 4 cm. 2009 Weed Science Society of Japan.",

METHODS We built a tool in the EMRs intraoperative nursing navigation screen for sending customized or standardized text pages to families in English or Spanish. Preoperatively families were given text pagers with instructions and a hospital map to facilitate leaving the waiting area. After 6 months Press-Ganey data and internal surveys from randomly selected families and all nurses and surgeons were analyzed for satisfaction and effectiveness. RESULTS Press-Ganey data demonstrated 30 improvement in patient satisfaction p 0.05. Among families 90 indicated pagers were easy to use and provided the desired information during surgery. Of nurses 90 found the system easy to use and believed it improved families experience. All surgeons reported improved intraoperative communication and ease of finding families postoperatively. CONCLUSION Perioperative family communication via EMR-integrated text improves efficiency and family nurse and surgeon satisfaction.",

However we exhibit one chiral 8-crossing knot and one chiral 9-crossing knot which can be unknotted by either crossing change. Furthermore we address the question analytically using results of Taniyama and Traczyk. We apply Taniyamas classification of unknotting operations to chiral rational knots and fully classify all those which in a single step can be unknotted by either type of crossing change the first of these is 813. As a corollary we obtain Stoimenows result that all chiral twist knots can be unknotted by only one of the two crossing change types - or -. Thus as was observed numerically all chiral knots with unknotting number one and seven or fewer crossings can be unknotted by only one of the two crossing change types. Traczyks results allow us to address the question for some non-rational chiral unknotting number one knots with 9 or fewer crossings however for others the question remains open. We propose a numerical approach for investigating the latter type of knot. We also discuss the implications of our work in the context of DNA topology.

The models exhibit four behaviors persistence for all initial population densities bistability in which a population persists for intermediate initial densities and otherwise goes extinct extinction for all initial densities and essential extinction in which almost every initial density leads to extinction. For fast-growing populations these models show populations can persist at high levels of predation even though lower levels of predation lead to essential extinction. Alternatively increasing the predators handling time the populations carrying capacity or the likelihood of mating success may lead to essential extinction. In each of these cases the mechanism behind these disappearances are chaotic dynamics driving populations below a critical threshold determined by the Allee effect. These disappearances are proceeded by chaotic transients that are proven to be approximately exponentially distributed in length and highly sensitive to initial population densities.",

We select galaxies whose colors correspond to those of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members in the i versus r - i color-magnitude diagram. Using an adaptive kernel we generate a map of the projected red galaxy density and identify numerous new candidate clusters that are likely supercluster members.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether T2 relaxation time measurements obtained at 3 T MRI predict the onset of radiographic knee osteoarthritis OA. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a nested case-control study of incident radiographic knee OA in the Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort. Cases were 50 knees with baseline Kellgren-Lawrence KL grade of 0 that developed KL grade of 2 or more over a 4-year period. Controls were 80 knees with KL grade of 0 after 4 years of follow-up. Baseline T2 relaxation time measurements and laminar analysis of T2 in deep and superficial layers were performed in all knee compartments. The association of T2 values with incident OA was assessed with logistic regression and differences in T2 values by case-control status with linear regression adjusting for age sex body mass index BMI and other covariates. RESULTS Baseline T2 values in all compartments except the medial tibia were significantly higher in knees that developed OA compared with controls and were particularly elevated in the superficial cartilage layers in all compartments. There was an increased likelihood of incident knee OA associated with higher baseline T2 values particularly in the patella adjusted OR per 1 SD increase in T2 3.37 95 CI 1.72 to 6.62 but also in the medial femur 1.90 1.07 to 3.39 lateral femur 2.17 1.11 to 4.25 and lateral tibia 2.23 1.16 to 4.31. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that T2 values assessed when radiographic changes are not yet apparent may be useful in predicting the development of radiological tibiofemoral OA.",

All of these rearrangements result in truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of EPOR at residues similar to those mutated in primary familial congenital polycythemia with preservation of the proximal tyrosine essential for receptor activation and loss of distal regulatory residues. This resulted in deregulated EPOR expression hypersensitivity to erythropoietin stimulation and heightened JAK-STAT activation. Expression of truncated EPOR in mouse B cell progenitors induced ALL in vivo. Human leukemic cells with EPOR rearrangements were sensitive to JAK-STAT inhibition suggesting a therapeutic option in high-risk ALL.",

    "abstract": "Designing virtual characters that are capable of conveying a sense of personality is important for generating realistic experiences and thus a key goal in computer animation research. Though the influence of gesture and body motion on personality perception has been studied little is known about which attributes of hand pose and motion convey particular personality traits. Using the Big Five model as a framework for evaluating personality traits this work examines how variations in hand pose and motion impact the perception of a characters personality. As has been done with facial motion we first study hand motion in isolation as a requirement for running controlled experiments that avoid the combinatorial explosion of multimodal communication all combinations of facial expressions arm movements body movements and hands and allow us to understand the communicative content of hands. We determined a set of features likely to reflect personality based on research in psychology and previous human motion perception work shape direction amplitude speed and manipulation. Then we captured realistic hand motion varying these attributes and conducted three perceptual experiments to determine the contribution of these attributes to the characters personalities. Both hand poses and the amplitude of hand motion affected the perception of all five personality traits. Speed impacted all traits except openness. Direction impacted extraversion and openness. Manipulation was perceived as an indicator of introversion disagreeableness neuroticism and less openness to experience. From these results we generalize guidelines for designing detailed hand motion that can add to the expressiveness and personality of characters. We performed an evaluation study that combined hand motion with gesture and body motion. Even in the presence of body motion hand motion still significantly impacted the perception of a characters personality and could even be the dominant factor in certain situations.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine the effect of shoulder extension and flexion imaging plane and intraarticular paramagnetic contrast medium administration on the visibility of soft tissue structures surrounding the canine shoulder joint using magnetic resonance MR imaging. Eight dogs without shoulder disease were imaged using a 1.5 T MR scanner. In all dogs T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences in sagittal transverse and dorsal planes and a sagittal short tau inversion recovery STIR sequence were acquired with the shoulder joint in extension. In five dogs postintravenous contrast medium T1-weighted images were obtained and in five dogs MR arthrography was performed in flexion and extension. Each specific soft tissue structure was assigned a visual assessment score of 0-3 and descriptive statistics were calculated. The biceps brachii supraspinatus and teres minor muscles and tendons and the biceps tendon sheath were best seen in the sagittal and transverse planes. The infraspinatus was well-visualized in all planes the subscapularis was best seen in the transverse and dorsal planes and the capsuloligmentous complexes were best seen in the transverse and dorsal planes. Limb extension improved conspicuousness of the medial capsuloligamentous stuctures. Arthrography resulted in greater conspicuousness of the biceps brachii tendon biceps tendon sheath infraspinatus supraspinatus subscapularis medial joint capsule medial glenohumeral ligament and the lateral joint capsule-glenohumeral ligament complex. The major periarticular anatomic structures of the normal canine shoulder were consistently identified using the protocols described in this investigation but arthrography with the joint in extension resulted in the best visualization of all structures.",

We focus on the kinematic topology in which a pair of identical particles is produced with each decaying to two leptons and an invisible particle schematically pp YYjets followed by each Y decaying via Y X N where N is invisible. This topology arises in many SUSY processes such as squark and gluino production and decay not to mention t di-lepton decays. In the example where the final state leptons are all muons our errors on the masses of the particles Y X and N in the decay chain range from 4 GeV for 2000 events after cuts to 13 GeV for 400 events after cuts. Errors for mass differences are much smaller. Our ability to determine masses comes from considering all the kinematic information in the event including the missing momentum in conjunction with the quadratic constraints that arise from the Y X and N mass-shell conditions. Realistic missing momentum and lepton momenta uncertainties are included in the analysis. SISSA 2007.",

Here we use tangle equations to analyze the topological changes associated with Xer recombination at psi. This mathematical method allows computation of all possible topological pathways consistent with the experimental data. We give a rigorous mathematical proof that under reasonable biological assumptions there are only three solutions to the tangle equations. One of the solutions corresponds to a synaptic complex with antiparallel alignment of recombination core sites the other two correspond to parallel alignment of cores. We show that all three solutions can be unified into a single three-dimensional model for Xer recombination. Thus the three distinct mathematical solutions do not necessarily represent distinct three-dimensional pathways and in this case the three distinct tangle solutions are different planar projections of the same three-dimensional configuration.",

Here we sought to characterize responses to desiccation including hydraulic vulnerability xylem anatomical traits and impacts on other stem tissues that contribute to hydraulic functioning. METHODS Larix occidentalis Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus ponderosa all 6 weeks old were imaged using x-ray computed microtomography during desiccation to assess seedling biomechanical responses with concurrently measured hydraulic conductivity ks and water potential to assess vulnerability to xylem embolism formation and other tissue damage. RESULTS In non-stressed samples for all species pith and cortical cells appeared circular and well hydrated but they started to empty and deform with decreasing which resulted in cell tearing and eventual collapse. Despite the severity of this structural damage the vascular cambium remained well hydrated even under the most severe drought. There were significant differences among species in vulnerability to xylem embolism formation with 78 xylem embolism in L. occidentalis by of -2.1 MPa but only 47.7 and 62.1 in P. ponderosa and P. menziesii at -4.27 and -6.73 MPa respectively. CONCLUSIONS Larix occidentalis seedlings appeared to be more susceptible to secondary xylem embolism compared to the other two species but all three maintained hydration of the vascular cambium under severe stress which could facilitate hydraulic recovery by regrowth of xylem when stress is relieved.",

This enables efficient implementation of the proposed algorithms even in parallel. The proposed algorithms can handle refined regions of complicated geometry and do not suffer from concavity restrictions associated with the three-refinement methods currently dominating the literature. Several application examples show the strength of these new algorithms in problems that require fast dynamic remeshing such as computational fluid dynamics and computer graphics. 2011 John Wiley Sons Ltd.",

The advent of new parallel sequencing technologies has opened up a new avenue of transcriptomics with ever deeper and deeper sequencing to identify and quantify each and every transcript in a sample. However this may not be the best usage of the parallel sequencing technology for all transcriptomics experiments. I utilized the Shannon Entropy approach to estimate the information contained within a transcriptomics experiment and tested the ability of shallow RNAseq to capture the majority of this information. This analysis showed that it was possible to capture nearly all of the network or genomic information present in a variety of transcriptomics experiments using a subset of the most abundant 5000 transcripts or less within any given sample. Thus it appears that it should be possible and affordable to conduct large scale factorial analysis with a high degree of replication using parallel sequencing technologies.",

ARMDC subjects showed the greatest weakness 2.5 - 1.0 mean Manual Muscle Test MMT grade for all muscles combined and the only significant progression of loss of strength -0.59 MMT unit decline per decade. Strength loss in ADLO and PF types was about the same 3.7 - 0.7 and 4.0 - 0.7 grades respectively. Quantitative strength measurements in ADLO and PF types were more sensitive than MMTs showing losses of 30-40 strength in muscle groups with MMT grades of 4 or higher. All three types showed greater proximal and lower extremity weakness but usually no difference between flexor and extensor strength. There was a high percentage 44 of mild very slowly progressive scoliosis in ARMDC but spine deformity was unusual in ADLO and PF 11 LGS. Contractures were few slowly progressive and usually mild in severity in all types although more frequent in ARMDC. There also was a low frequency of severe restrictive lung disease in all types 10 but a high percentage of electrocardiogram abnormalities 62-73. The most common electrocardiogram abnormalities were increased RS ratio in V1 and infranodal conduction defects. Intellectual and cognitive functions were within normal limits. Mobility and extremity function reflected the strength differences between the ARMDC and other types of LGS. Eight-five percent of ARMDC individuals relied on a wheelchair for all or part of their mobility and all were unable to complete timed motor performance tests within the 99th percentile range for controls.",

A total of 1624 oligomeric models were submitted by 108 predictor groups for the 30 oligomeric targets in the CASP12 edition. We evaluated the accuracy of oligomeric predictions by comparison to their reference structures at the interface patch and residue contact levels. We find that interface patches are more reliably predicted than the specific residue contacts. Whereas none of the 15 hard oligomeric targets have successful predictions for the residue contacts at the interface six have models with resemblance in the interface patch. Successful predictions of interface patch and contacts exist for all targets suitable for homology modeling with at least one group improving over the best available template for each target. However the participation in protein assembly prediction is low and uneven. Three human groups are closely ranked at the top by overall performance but a server outperforms all other predictors for targets suitable for homology modeling. The state of the art of protein assembly prediction methods is in development and has apparent room for improvement especially for assemblies without templates.",

However to utilize XFEL sources efficiently demands the continuous rapid delivery of a large number of difficult-to-handle microcrystals to the x-ray beam. A recently developed fixed-target system in which crystals of interest are enclosed within a sample holder which is rastered through the x-ray beam is discussed in detail in this Perspective. The fixed target is easy to use maintains sample hydration and can be readily modified to allow a broad range of sample types and different beamline requirements. Recent innovations demonstrate the potential of such microfluidic-based fixed targets to be an all-around workhorse for serial crystallography measurements.

Regardless of instruction all age groups more often looked first to negative versus positive faces no age differences suggesting that initial orienting is driven by bottom-up processes. In contrast biases in more sustained attention-last looks and looking duration-varied by age and could be modified by top-down instruction. On the free-viewing task all age groups exhibited a negativity bias which attenuated with age and remained stable across trials. When told to look only at happy faces directed task all age groups shifted to a positivity bias with linear age-related improvements. This ability to implement the look only at the happy faces instruction however fatigued over time with the decrement stronger for children. Controlling for age individual differences in executive function working memory and inhibitory control had no relation to the free-viewing task however these variables explained substantial variance on the directed task with children and adults higher in executive function showing better skill at looking last and looking longer at happy faces. Greater anxiety predicted more first looks to angry faces on the directed task. These findings advance theory and research on normative development and individual differences in the bias to prioritize negative information including contributions of bottom-up salience and top-down control.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The recD mutants of the Antarctic Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and fail to grow at 4 degrees C. Generally RecD associates with two other proteins RecB and RecC to produce RecBCD enzyme which is involved in homologous recombination and DNA repair in many bacteria including Escherichia coli. However RecD is not essential for DNA repair nor does its deletion cause any growth defects in E. coli. Hence the assessment of the P. syringae RecBCD pathway was imperative. METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS Mutational analysis and genetic complementation studies were used to establish that the individual null-mutations of all three genes recC recB and recD or the deletion of whole recCBD operon of P. syringae lead to growth inhibition at low temperature and sensitivity to UV and mitomycin C. Viability of the mutant cells dropped drastically at 4 degrees C and the mutants accumulated linear chromosomal DNA and shorter DNA fragments in higher amounts compared to 22 degrees C. Additional genetic data using the mutant RecBCD enzymes that were inactivated either in the ATPase active site of RecB RecBK29Q or RecD RecDK229Q or in the nuclease center of RecB RecBD1118A and RecBDelta nuc suggested that while the nuclease activity of RecB is not so critical in vivo the ATP-dependent functions of both RecB and RecD are essential. Surprisingly E. coli recBCD or recBC alone on plasmid could complement the defects of the Delta recCBD strain of P. syringae. CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE All three subunits of the RecBCDPs enzyme are essential for DNA repair and growth of P. syringae at low temperatures 4 degrees C. The RecD requirement is only a function of the RecBCD complex in the bacterium. The RecBCD pathway protects the Antarctic bacterium from cold-induced DNA damages and is critically dependent on the helicase activities of both RecB and RecD subunits but not on the nuclease of RecBCDPs enzyme.",

    "abstract": "The medical community is forced to accelerate the move from opinion-based to evidence-based medicine that is to aim at basing all caring and clinical practice on empiri. A clear-cut epistemology would facilitate this process. In this article we present a comprehensive clinical epidemiological theory which can be used for validity issues in caring science quality of life research controlled clinical trials and compilations of uncontrolled evidence. The theory is based on four distinct stages that can be identified in a study whereof the first is demarcation of the source person-time. A source person-time study base can be identified for any study in all disciplines giving an argument for using this concept as the common reference point for validity issues. Apart from identifying the source person-time recovery of the actually observed person-time collection of data and calculation of an adjusted effect parameter e.g. incidence ratio are additional stages of a study. When the source person-time is demarcated confounding is introduced when the actually observed person-time is recovered misrepresentation in the third stage misclassification and in the fourth analytical alteration of the parameter of effect. The concept of the source person-time can in addition link examination of validity in caring and clinical sciences to observational studies thereby allowing the field to benefit from all theoretical achievements for preventing handling and understanding systematic errors developed in epidemiology. We conclude it is possible to implement a common terminology of validity for all caring and medical sciences. Drawing causal inferences in these disciplines is not mechanical it can never for example be done with statistical inference. Establishing a causal relation always includes an assessment of the magnitude and direction of systematic errors influencing the adjusted effect parameter. From the presented epistemology it follows that differences in validity from a case history to a large randomized placebo-controlled and double-blinded study are quantitative rather than qualitative. This realization in turn opens up for a more refined discussion of when a decision is evidence-based rather than opinion-based.",

    "abstract": "The ants in the subfamily Amblyoponinae are an old relictual group with an unusual suite of morphological and behavioural features. Adult workers pierce the integument of their larvae to imbibe haemolymph earning them the vernacular name dracula ants. We investigate the phylogeny of this group with a data set based on 54 ingroup taxa 23 outgroups and 11 nuclear gene fragments 7.4 kb. We find that the genus Opamyrma has been misplaced in this subfamily it is a member of the leptanilline clade and sister to all other extant Leptanillinae. Transfer of Opamyrma to Leptanillinae renders the Amblyoponinae monophyletic. The enigmatic Afrotropical genus Apomyrma is sister to all other amblyoponines and the latter cleave into two distinct and well-supported clades here termed POA and XMMAS. The POA clade containing Prionopelta Onychomyrmex and Amblyopone is well resolved internally and its structure supports synonymy of the genus Concoctio under Prionopelta syn.n.. The XMMAS clade comprises two well-supported groups i a predominantly Neotropical clade for which we resurrect the genus name Fulakora stat.r. stat.n. with junior synonyms Paraprionopelta syn.n. and Ericapelta syn.n. and ii the remaining taxa or core XMMAS which are manifested in our study as a poorly resolved bush of about a dozen lineages suggesting rapid radiation at the time of their origin. Most of these XMMAS lineages have been assigned to the catch-all genus Stigmatomma but the more distinctive elements have been treated as separate genera Xymmer Mystrium Myopopone and Adetomyrma. Resolution of basal relationships in the core XMMAS clade and reconfiguration of Stigmatomma to restore monophyly of all named genera will require more extensive genetic data and additional morphological analysis. However the genus Bannapone can be synonymized under Stigmatomma syn.n. because it is embedded within a clade that contains S. denticulatum the type species of Stigmatomma. Divergence dating analysis indicates that crown Amblyoponinae arose in the mid-Cretaceous about 107 Ma 95 highest probability density 93-121 Ma. The POA and XMMAS clades have estimated crown ages of 47 and 73 Ma respectively. The initial burst of diversification in the core XMMAS clade occurred in the Late PaleoceneEarly Eocene 50-60 Ma. Ancestral range reconstruction suggests that amblyoponines originated in the Afrotropics and dispersed to the Indo-Malayan region and to the New World. During none of these dispersal events did the ants break out of their cryptobiotic lifestyle.",

The need to accumulate sufficient resources after depletion following fruiting resource budget the efficiency of mass flowering for outcross pollination pollen coupling or the external factors preventing reproduction environmental veto could all synchronize masting. We used seed production data for four species Quercus ilex Quercus humilis Sorbus aucuparia and Pinus albicaulis to parametrize resource budget models of masting. Based on species life-history characteristics we hypothesized that pollen coupling should synchronize reproduction in S. aucuparia and P. albicaulis while in Q. ilex and Q. humilis environmental veto should be a major factor. Pollen coupling was stronger in S. aucuparia and P. albicaulis than in oaks while veto was more frequent in the latter. Yet in all species costs of reproduction were too small to impose a replenishment period. A synchronous environmental veto in the presence of environmental stochasticity was sufficient to produce observed variability and synchrony in reproduction. In the past vetoes like frost events that prevent reproduction have been perceived as negative for plants. In fact they could be selectively favored as a way to create mast seeding.",

We develop numerical linked cluster NLC expansions for the area-law logarithmic entanglement negativity as a function of temperature and other parameters. For one-dimensional models the results of NLC are compared with exact diagonalization on finite systems and are found to agree very well. The NLC results are also obtained for two dimensional XXZ and transverse field Ising models. In all cases we find a sudden onset or sudden death of negativity at a finite temperature above which the negativity is zero. We use perturbation theory to develop a physical picture for this sudden onset or sudden death. The onset of EN or its magnitude are insensitive to classical finite-temperature phase transitions supporting the argument for absence of any role of quantum mechanics at such transitions. On approach to a quantum critical point at T0 negativity shows critical scaling in size and temperature.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy DMD is an X-linked muscle disorder caused by a mutation or deletion in the dystrophin gene. In boys with DMD muscle weakness progresses in a proximal to distal pattern leading to gait abnormalities at all joints in all planes of motion. Longitudinal studies are imperative to quantify changes in gait function due to DMD and are of particular importance when examining the efficacy of treatment interventions. RESEARCH QUESTION The purpose of this study was to examine the sensitivity of the Gait Deviation Index GDI and Movement Analysis Profile Gait Profile Score GPS and Gait Variable Score GVS to quantify the longitudinal ambulatory decline in boys with DMD. A secondary aim was to quantify the effect of corticosteroid CS treatment. METHODS The gait patterns of 75 boys were assessed longitudinally 11 were steroid nave SN and 64 received CS treatment. Joint kinematics were collected using either a VICON 612 or a Motion Analysis Corporation 3-D system. Representative trials were used to compute the GDI GPS and the nine GVS for each boy for each visit. RESULTS At baseline GVS for the boys with DMD revealed abnormalities in all lower extremity joints and in all planes of movement compared to TD peers. GDI and GPS indices verified that the overall quality of gait in boys with DMD decreases at a significant rate with age. Boys who were steroid nave changed at a rate 3 times greater than boys on CS in coronal plane hip motion. SIGNIFICANCE The gait indices of GDI and GPS are able to identify changes in the quality of gait patterns in boys with DMD. Although boys on steroids had greater gait deviations than boys who were SN at baseline the rate of decline in gait quality was slower in boys on CS.",

Identifying critical gaps and central hubs in food systems is of importance in addressing a variety of concerns such as navigating rapid shifts in marketing practices as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic and related food shortages. The constellation of growers and markets can also reinforce opportunities to shift growing and eating policies and practices with attention to addressing racial and income inequities in food system ownership and access. With this research we compare network methods for measuring centrality and sociospatial orientations in food systems using two of Americas most high-producing agricultural counties. Though the counties are adjacent we demonstrate that their community food systems have little overlap in contributing farms and markets. Our findings show that the community food system for Yolo County is tightly interwoven with Bay Area restaurants and farmers markets. The adjacent county Sacramento branded itself as Americas Farm-to-Fork capital in 2012 and possesses network hubs focused more on grocery stores and restaurants. In both counties the most central actors differ and have been involved with the community food system for decades. Such findings have implications beyond the case studies and we conclude with considerations for how our methods could be standardized in the national agricultural census.",

    "abstract": "Data from two large longitudinal studies were used to analyze reciprocal relations between self-esteem and depressive symptoms across the adult life span. Study 1 included 1685 participants aged 18 to 96 years assessed 4 times over a 9-year period. Study 2 included 2479 participants aged 18 to 88 years assessed 3 times over a 4-year period. In both studies cross-lagged regression analyses indicated that low self-esteem predicted subsequent depressive symptoms but depressive symptoms did not predict subsequent levels of self-esteem. This pattern of results replicated across all age groups for both affective-cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression and after controlling for content overlap between the self-esteem and depression scales. The results suggest that low self-esteem operates as a risk factor for depressive symptoms at all phases of the adult life span.",

    "abstract": "CD47 a dont eat me signal for phagocytic cells is expressed on the surface of all human solid tumor cells. Analysis of patient tumor and matched adjacent normal nontumor tissue revealed that CD47 is overexpressed on cancer cells. CD47 mRNA expression levels correlated with a decreased probability of survival for multiple types of cancer. CD47 is a ligand for SIRP a protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. In vitro blockade of CD47 signaling using targeted monoclonal antibodies enabled macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells that were otherwise protected. Administration of anti-CD47 antibodies inhibited tumor growth in orthotopic immunodeficient mouse xenotransplantation models established with patient tumor cells and increased the survival of the mice over time. Anti-CD47 antibody therapy initiated on larger tumors inhibited tumor growth and prevented or treated metastasis but initiation of the therapy on smaller tumors was potentially curative. The safety and efficacy of targeting CD47 was further tested and validated in immune competent hosts using an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model. These results suggest all human solid tumor cells require CD47 expression to suppress phagocytic innate immune surveillance and elimination. These data taken together with similar findings with other human neoplasms show that CD47 is a commonly expressed molecule on all cancers its function to block phagocytosis is known and blockade of its function leads to tumor cell phagocytosis and elimination. CD47 is therefore a validated target for cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Many organisms are able to survive subzero temperatures at which bodily fluids would normally be expected to freeze. These organisms have adapted to these lower temperatures by synthesizing antifreeze proteins AFPs capable of binding to ice which make further growth of ice energetically unfavorable. To date the structures of five AFPs have been determined and they show considerable sequence and structural diversity. The type I AFP reveals a single 37-residue alpha-helical structure. We have studied the behavior of wild-type type I AFP and two inactive mutants Ala17Leu and Thr13SerThr24Ser in normal and supercooled solutions of H2O and deuterium oxide D2O to see if the structure at temperatures below the equilibrium freezing point is different from the structure observed at above freezing temperatures. Analysis of 1D 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra illustrate that all three proteins remain folded as the temperature is lowered and even seem to become more alpha-helical as evidenced by 13Calpha-NMR chemical shift changes. Furthermore 13C-T2 NMR relaxation measurements demonstrate that the rotational correlation times of all three proteins behave in a predictable manner under all temperatures and conditions studied. These data have important implications for the structure of the AFP bound to ice as well as the mechanisms for ice-binding and protein oligomerization.",

This article examines the interaction of three seemingly unrelated policies the Clean Air Act the U.S. corn program and European Union agricultural subsidies. More ethanol production resulting from new regulations associated with the Clean Air Act increases the use of U.S. corn and increases the supply of corn gluten feed an ethanol coproduct. Corn gluten feed is primarily exported to Europe under a loophole in European Union trade barriers. But recent reform of European Union farm policy will lower the price of the European grain for which corn gluten feed is a substitute. This development lowers prices for a major ethanol coproduct and thus makes ethanol itself less profitable just as the demand for the fuel is expanding.

    "abstract": "Over the past 30 yr individual California dairy operations have grown in size however little is known about the distribution and determinants of particulate matter PM concentrations on these dairies. Elevated exposure to PM is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular health effects particularly in occupational settings. The purpose of this study was to quantify the concentrations of PM and all inhalable PM 0-100 m on California dairies. Samplers were placed at various locations e.g. milking parlor grain storage area drylot corral and freestall barns on 13 different dairies to collect PM and all inhalable PM during the 2008 summer months. The PM and all inhalable PM concentrations varied between different areas on a dairy and from dairy to dairy. Geometric mean concentrations for PM and inhalable PM were 24 g m range 2-116 g m and 332 g m range 74-1690 g m. A key variable for explaining variation in PM concentrations with a mixed effects model was regional background ambient concentrations of PM No significant differences were observed in mean concentrations between upwind and downwind fence line concentrations adjusted geometric mean ratio AGMR 0.7 95 CI 0.4-1.3 although significant differences were found between upwind and central location mean values AGMR 0.5 95 CI 0.3-0.8 0.01. These results indicate dairy PM sources and thus elevated occupational exposure. Covariates such as the age of the dairy and number of cows in the freestall barn and drylot corral were important variables in explaining PM concentration variability. Levels of PM were lower compared with dairies in other U.S. states and other countries.",

STUDY DESIGN We developed standard decision models with assumptions derived from primary data and the literature. Telemedicine costs included equipment installation and operation costs. Probabilistic analysis with Monte Carlo simulation was performed to address model uncertainties and to estimate 95 probabilistic confidence intervals PCIs. All costs were adjusted to 2017 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index. RESULTS Our probabilistic analysis estimated the ROI to have a mean value of 2.23 95 PCI -0.7 to 6.0. That is a 1 investment in this telemedicine model would yield a net medical expenditure saving of 1.23. Cost saving was observed for 75 of the hypothetical 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. For the state of California the estimated mean annual net savings was 661 000. CONCLUSIONS Providing telemedicine and making available consultations to rural hospitals providing level I neonatal care are likely to reduce medical expenditures by reducing potentially avoidable transfers of newborns to level III and IV NICUs offsetting all telemedicine-related costs.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has looked at extending the k-Means algorithm to incorporate background information in the form of instance level must-link and cannot-link constraints. We introduce two ways of specifying additional background information in the form of and constraints that operate on all instances but which can be interpreted as conjunctions or disjunctions of instance level constraints and hence are easy to implement. We present complexity results for the feasibility of clustering under each type of constraint individually and several types together. A key finding is that determining whether there is a feasible solution satisfying all constraints is in general NP-complete. Thus an iterative algorithm such as k-Means should not try to find a feasible partitioning at each iteration. This motivates our derivation of a new version of the k-Means algorithm that minimizes the constrained vector quantization error but at each iteration does not attempt to satisfy all constraints. Using standard UCI datasets we find that using constraints improves accuracy as others have reported but we also show that our algorithm reduces the number of iterations until convergence. Finally we illustrate these benefits and our new constraint types on a complex real world object identification problem using the infra-red detector on an Aibo robot. Copyright by SIAM.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric en bloc kidney transplants EBKs from small deceased pediatric donors are associated with increased early graft loss and morbidity. Yet urologic complications post-EBK and their potential impact on graft survival have not been systematically studied. We retrospectively studied urological complications requiring intervention for 225 EBKs performed at our center January 2005 to September 2017 from donors 20 kg into recipients 18 years. Overall ureteral complication incidence after EBK was 9.8 n 22 12 vs 2 for EBK donors 10 vs 10 kg respectively P .031. The most common post-EBK urologic complication was a stricture 55 followed by urine leak 41. In all 95 of all urologic complications occurred early within 5 months posttransplant median 138 days. Urologic complications could be successfully managed nonoperatively in 50 of all cases and had no impact on graft or patient survival. In summary urologic complications after EBK were common associated with lower donor weights occurred early posttransplant and were often amenable to nonoperative treatment without adversely affecting survival. We conclude that the higher urologic complication rate after EBK 1 should not prevent increased utilization of small pediatric donor en bloc kidneys for properly selected recipients and 2 warrants specific discussion with EBK recipients during the preoperative consent process.",

    "abstract": "The United States has experienced an unprecedented decline in violent crime over the last two decades. Throughout this decline however violent crime continued to concentrate in socially and economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods. Using detailed homicide records from 1990 to 2010 this study examines the spatial patterning of violent crime in Chicago to determine whether or not all neighborhoods experienced decreases in violence. We find that while in absolute terms nearly all neighborhoods in the city benefited from reductions in homicide relative inequality in crime between the citys safest and most dangerous neighborhoods actually increased by 10 percent. This increase was driven by a greater rate of decline in the citys safest neighborhoods. This crime gap can be partly attributed to the decreasing association between concentrated disadvantage and homicide in the safest neighborhoods. We also find that the decline did not significantly alter the spatial distribution of crime as homicides remained concentrated in the initially most dangerous neighborhoods and their adjacent areas.",

This study examines the reliability and validity of different FTR measures currently in use. RESEARCH DESIGN We studied 3 definitions 1 original FTR using all deaths 2 FTR-N a nursing sensitive definition that uses only specific complications and deaths and 3 FTR-A another restricted definition of FTR used by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ for analyzing Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project HCUP data. Each FTR measure was applied to 403679 general surgical patients across 1567 hospitals reported in 1999-2000 Medicare MEDPAR data. RESULTS Although FTR used all deaths FTR-N and FTR-A definitions omitted 49 and 42 of deaths respectively. Reliability was better for FTR than FTR-A or FTR-N rho 0.32 vs. 0.18 vs. 0.18 respectively. VALIDITY Hospitals ranked by adjusted mortality were highly correlated with FTR Kendalls tau 0.83 and less correlated with FTR-A tau 0.43 and FTR-N tau 0.41. Adjusting for patient characteristics all FTR measures showed strong associations with bed-to-nurse ratio nursing mix teaching status and hospital size however hospital high technology was not as well associated with FTR-N. CONCLUSIONS For general surgery more limited definitions used by FTR-N and FTR-A omit over 40 of deaths display less reliability and may have more questionable validity than the original FTR measure. We encourage analysts to use the original FTR definition that uses all deaths when analyzing hospital quality of care.",

ANIMALS STUDIED Twenty client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Canine patients diagnosed with KCS were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were randomly selected to receive either Vizoovet or GenTeal drops twice daily in addition to twice daily tacrolimus 0.03 solution. Data were collected from only one eye of each patient and included STT-1 IOP TFBUT and results of objective clinical scoring performed by pet owners. Statistical significance was set at P .05. RESULTS In all 20 dogs 20 eyes were enrolled in this prospective randomized study. Females n 12 60 outnumbered males n 8 40 and all dogs were spayedneutered. Mean age of all dogs was 10.6 3.79 years. In both treatment groups the improvement in STT-1 values over the course of the study was significant P .002. When comparing the STT-1 improvements between groups no significance was found P .78. In both groups the improvement in TFBUT was significant P .0018. When comparing the TFBUT improvements between groups no significance was found P .14. Squinting rubbing ocular discharge and medication administration scores all significantly improved throughout the course of the study however they did not differ significantly between groups. Throughout the study no adverse side effects were noted clinically or by the pet owner in either group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Adjunctive treatment with Vizoovet was as safe and effective as GenTeal drops at improving clinical signs of dry eye in dogs.",

METHODS Women who were scheduled for breast biopsy were approached for participation in this IRB and HIPPA-compliant investigation. A total of 23 women had all views of each modality and represent the cohort studied in this investigation. Image data sets across all modalities were analyzed using 1000 regions of interest per image data set and the anatomical noise power spectrum NPSaf was computed and averaged for each breast image data set. After windowing the total noise power spectrum NPStf to a specific frequency range corresponding to anatomical noise the power-law slope of the NPSaf was computed where NPSaf f- .

For tomosynthesis was 3.06 0.361 and 3.10 0.315 for the craniocaudal CC and medial lateral oblique MLO views respectively. For mammography these values were 3.17 0.226 and 3.30 0.236 for the CC and MLO views respectively. The values of for breast CT were significantly different than those for tomosynthesis and mammography p 0.001 all 12 comparisons. CONCLUSIONS Based on the parameter which is thought to describe anatomical noise in breast images breast CT was shown to have a statistically significant lower than mammography or tomosynthesis.

Most are approximations to true bi-convex shapes e.g. glued spheres sphere-intersections sphero-cylinders and super-ellipsoids and others such as the discrete function representation are computationally expensive. In this paper algorithms are presented for determining if two true bi-convex tablets or a bi-convex tablet and an infinite plane are in contact. A bi-convex tablet has two spherical caps and a cylindrical band. In all ten contact scenarios are examined involving all components of the tablets i.e. caps band and edges. In addition to checking for contact relations for determining the contact location overlap and unit normal vector for the contact are presented for use in discrete element method computer simulations. These algorithms have been validated for single and multiple tablet scenarios a comparing translational and angular velocities of a single bi-convex tablet impacting a flat plane b comparing the fill fractions of bi-convex tablets in a container and c comparing the dynamic angle of repose of bi-convex tablets in a rotating drum. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial genome mitogenome has been extensively used as molecular markers in determining the insect phylogenetic relationships. In order to resolve the relationships among tribes and subtribes of Satyrinae at the mitochondrial genomic level we obtained the complete mitogenome of Aulocera merlina Oberthr 1890 Lepidoptera Nymphalidae Satyrinae with a size of 15259 bp. The mitogenome consisted of 37 typical genes including 13 protein-coding genes PCGs 2 ribosomal RNA genes rRNAs 22 transfer RNA genes tRNAs and an A T-rich region. The gene organization and arrangement were similar to those of all other known Satyrinae mitogenomes. All PCGs were initiated with the canonical codon pattern ATN except for the cox1 gene which used an atypical CGA codon. Nine PCGs used the complete stop codon TAA while the remaining PCGs cox1 cox2 nad4 and nad5 were terminated with a single T nucleotide. The canonical cloverleaf secondary structures were found in all tRNAs except for trnS1 which lacked a dihydrouridine arm. The 448 bp A T-rich region was located between rrnS and trnM and it included the motif ATAGA followed by a 19-bp poly-T stretch and a microsatellite-like TA6 element preceded by the ATTTA motif. The phylogenetic tree inferred using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods generated similar tree topologies revealing well-supported monophyletic groups at the tribe level and recovering the relationship Satyrini Melanitini Amathusiini Elymniini Zetherini. The close relationship between Satyrina and Melanargiina within the Satyrini was widely accepted. Additionally Lethina Parargina and Mycalesina were closely related and collectively formed a sister group to Coenonymphina. Moreover A. merlina was closely related to Oeneis buddha within the Satyrina. These findings will provide valuable information for future studies aiming to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of Satyrinae.",

The rare Jka-b- phenotype is more common in Polynesians. Anti-Jk3 like other Kidd system antibodies is difficult to detect because in vivo production may be absent between provocative episodes and because these antibodies often show weak in vitro reactions. The increasing numbers of Pacific Islanders in the United States could result in more frequent encounters with this rare phenotype.

All-cause mortality through Day 42 was numerically lower in the non-primary ISAVUSULF group than in the primary ISAVUSULF and other AFT groups for patients with IM 20.0 vs. 33.3 and 41.3 respectively or IA-nf 0 vs. 14.8 and 17.8 respectively. All-cause mortality tended to be lower with combination therapy than with monotherapy except for patients with IM receiving primary ISAVUSULF. Of 111 patients receiving ISAVUSULF 14 12.6 reported ADRs of whom three 2.7 developed serious ADRs. There were no drug-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the effectiveness and tolerability of ISAVUSULF in clinical practice. Further research is required to confirm the value of ISAVUSULF combination therapy over monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Population-level research on the implications of retail pharmacy policies to end the sale of tobacco products is scant and the impact of such policies on racialethnic and socioeconomic disparities across neighborhoods in access to tobacco products remains unexplored. METHODS We investigated the association between neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics and tobacco retail density in Rhode Island RI N 240 census tracts. We also investigated whether the CVS Health N 60 policy to end the sale of tobacco products reduces the disparity in the density of tobacco retail across neighborhoods and we conducted a prospective policy analysis to determine whether a similar policy change in all pharmacies in RI N 135 would reduce the disparity in tobacco retail density. RESULTS The results revealed statistically significant associations between neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics and tobacco retail outlet density across RI neighborhoods. The results when excluding the CVS Health locations as well as all pharmacies as tobacco retailers revealed no change in the pattern for this association. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that while a commendable tobacco control policy the CVS Health policy appears to have no impact on the neighborhood racialethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the density of tobacco retailers in RI. Prospective policy analyses showed no impact on this disparity even if all other pharmacies in the state adopted a similar policy. IMPACT Policy efforts aimed at reducing the disparity in access to tobacco products should focus on reducing the density of tobacco outlets in poor and racialethnic neighborhoods.

The ultimate goal of steganalysis is two-fold making a binary classification of a file as stego-bearing or innocent and secondly locating the hidden message with an aim to extracting sterilizing or manipulating it. Almost all steganalysis approaches known as attacks focus on the first of these two issues. In this paper we explore the difficult related problem given that we know an image file contains steganography locate which pixels contain the message. We treat the hidden message location problem as outlier detection using probabilityenergy measures of images motivated by the image restoration community. Pixels contributing the most to the energy calculations of an image are deemed outliers. Typically of the top third of one percent of most energized pixels outliers we find that 87 are stego-bearing in color images and 61 in grayscale images. In all image types only 1 of all pixels are stego-bearing indicating our techniques provides a substantial lift over random guessing.",

METHODS We studied the database of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010. Basic variables metabolic diseases and bone density of different femoral areas were stratified into four subgroups according to different protein intake DPI that is 0.8 0.8-1.0 1.0-1.2 and 1.2 gkgday. RESULTS Significant differences were found among all lumbar area bone mineral density BMD and T-scores p 0.0001. There was an apparent trend between a decreasing BMD in the CKD groups with increasing DPI in all single lumbar spines L1 L2 L3 and L4 and all L spines L1-L4.

However a higher risk of osteoporosis was observed only in the non-CKD group. There was an apparent trend of higher DPI coexisting with lower BMD and T scores in patients with CKD. For osteoporosis reference0.8-1.0 gdaykg lower 0.8 gdaykg or higher DPI 1.2 gdaykg was associated with higher risks in the non-CKD group but not in the CKD group.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Hyper-CVAD is an established regimen for adult ALL that was developed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center MDACC. However results can vary across different institutions given the heterogeneity of patient populations and institutional practices. Moreover while a MDACC study demonstrated that the combination of ponatinib plus hyper-CVAD produced remarkable activity in untreated Ph ALL it remains to be externally validated. We sought to validate those findings in previously untreated adult patients with Ph ALL. METHODS This was a retrospective study analyzing the outcomes of previously untreated adult ALL patients treated with hyper-CVAD with a focus on Ph ALL patients treated with ponatinib plus hyper-CVAD. RESULTS 82 patients were included. The median age was 51 years. The median follow-up was 2.62 years. The 5-year overall survival OS and event-free survival EFS were 39.5 and 28.2 respectively. For Ph ALL patients n 13 receiving ponatinib plus hyper-CVAD 3-year OS and EFS were both 92.3 . Univariate analysis showed a high WBC and poor-risk cytogenetics to be associated with inferior outcomes while CD20 predicted favorable outcomes in B-ALL patients. On multivariate analysis CD20 retained significance for Philadelphia-negative Ph- ALL. For Ph ALL ponatinib was associated with better OS and EFS on univariate and multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Our data supports the use of ponatinib plus hyper-CVAD as a standard of care regimen for Ph ALL. Our outcomes for Ph-ALL and T-cell ALL T-ALL show that advances are still needed in the frontline setting and clinical trial enrollment is recommended.",

    "abstract": "We apply clustering-based redshift inference to all extended sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric catalogue down to magnitude r 22. We map the relationships between colours and redshift without assumption of the sources spectral energy distributions SEDs. We identify and locate star-forming quiescent galaxies and active galactic nuclei as well as colour changes due to spectral features such as the 4000 break redshifting through specific filters. Our mapping is globally in good agreement with colour-redshift tracks computed with SED templates but reveals informative differences such as the need for a lower fraction of M-type stars in certain templates. We compare our clustering-redshift estimates to photometric redshifts and find these two independent estimators to be in good agreement at each limiting magnitude considered. Finally we present the global clustering-redshift distribution of all Sloan extended sources showing objects up to z 0.8. While the overall shape agrees with that inferred from photometric redshifts the clustering-redshift technique results in a smoother distribution with no indication of structure in redshift space suggested by the photometricredshift estimates likely artefacts imprinted by their spectroscopic training set. We also infer a higher fraction of high-redshift objects. The mapping between the four observed colours and redshift can be used to estimate the redshift probability distribution function of individual galaxies. Thiswork is an initial step towards producing a general mapping between redshift and all available observables in the photometric space including brightness size concentration and ellipticity.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing HTS is a powerful tool that enables the simultaneous detection and potential identification of any organisms present in a sample. The growing interest in the application of HTS technologies for routine diagnostics in plant health laboratories is triggering the development of guidelines on how to prepare laboratories for performing HTS testing. This paper describes general and technical recommendations to guide laboratories through the complex process of preparing a laboratory for HTS tests within existing quality assurance systems. From nucleic acid extractions to data analysis and interpretation all of the steps are covered to ensure reliable and reproducible results. These guidelines are relevant for the detection and identification of any plant pest e.g. arthropods bacteria fungi nematodes invasive plants or weeds protozoa viroids viruses and from any type of matrix e.g. pure microbial culture plant tissue soil water regardless of the HTS technology e.g. amplicon sequencing shotgun sequencing and of the application e.g. surveillance programme phytosanitary certification quarantine import control. These guidelines are written in general terms to facilitate the adoption of HTS technologies in plant pest routine diagnostics and enable broader application in all plant health fields including research.

Male-specific stroke genes were associated with integrin integrin-liked kinase actin tight junction Wnt-catenin RhoA fibroblast growth factors FGF granzyme and tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR2 signaling. Female-specific stroke genes were associated with p53 high-mobility group box-1 hypoxia inducible factor HIF1 interleukin IL1 IL6 IL12 IL18 acute-phase response T-helper macrophage and estrogen signaling. Cell death signaling was overrepresented in both genders although the molecules and pathways differed. Gender affects gene expression in the blood of IS patients which likely implies gender differences in immune inflammatory and cell death responses to stroke.",

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SAMPLE 13 dry and 11 canned vegetarian diets for dogs and cats. PROCEDURES Concentrations of CP and AAs were determined for each diet. Values were compared with the Association of American Feed Control Officials AAFCO Dog and Cat Food Nutrient Profiles. Product labels were assessed for compliance with AAFCO regulations. RESULTS CP concentration dry-matter basis ranged from 19.2 to 40.3 median 29.8. Minimum CP concentrations for the specified species and life stage were met by 23 diets the remaining diet passed appropriate AAFCO feeding trials. Six diets did not meet all AA minimums compared with the AAFCO nutrient profiles. Of these 6 diets 1 was below AAFCO minimum requirements in 4 AAs leucine methionine methionine-cystine and taurine 2 were below in 3 AAs methionine methionine-cystine and taurine 2 were below in 2 AAs lysine and tryptophan and 1 was below in 1 AA tryptophan. Only 3 and 8 diets with and without a statement of calorie content as a requirement respectively were compliant with all pet food label regulations established by the AAFCO. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Most diets assessed in this study were not compliant with AAFCO labeling regulations and there were concerns regarding adequacy of AA content. Manufacturers should ensure regulatory compliance and nutritional adequacy of all diets and pets fed commercially available vegetarian diets should be monitored and assessed routinely.",

Although invasive intervention is rarely necessary for mild pericardial inflammation pericardial abscess can be life-threatening. The charts of 27 patients with pericarditis requiring management in the intensive care unit andor invasive intervention at Harborview Medical Center during a 10-year period were reviewed. Six cases of trauma-related pericarditis were identified including three cases of pericardial abscess following torso trauma without initial cardiac or pericardial injury. Pericardial abscess following trauma was associated with the sepsis syndrome and multiple system organ failure MSOF in all patients. Computed tomography and pericardiocentesis were useful diagnostic adjuncts. All patients required thoracotomy for pericardial drainage and pericardiectomy. Successful surgical management of pericardial abscess contributed to the resolution of sepsis multiple end-organ dysfunction and ultimately patient survival in all cases. We conclude that pericardial abscess although rare should be considered a potential occult site of sepsis capable of driving MSOF in trauma patients.

    "abstract": "At the joint between the membrane and hydrophilic arms of the enzyme the structure of the respiratory complex I reveals a tunnel-like Q-chamber for ubiquinone binding and reduction. The narrow entrance of the quinone chamber located in ND1 subunit forms a bottleneck eye of a needle which in all resolved structures was shown to be too small for a bulky quinone to pass through and it was suggested that a conformational change is required to open the channel. The closed bottleneck appears to be a well-established feature of all structures reported so-far both for the so-called open and closed states of the enzyme with no indication of a stable open state of the bottleneck. We propose a squeeze-in mechanism of the bottleneck passage where dynamic thermal conformational fluctuations allow quinone to get in and out. Here using molecular dynamics simulations of the bacterial enzyme we have identified collective conformational changes that open the quinone chamber bottleneck. The model predicts a significant reduction-due to a need for a rare opening of the bottleneck-of the effective bi-molecular rate constant in line with the available kinetic data. We discuss possible reasons for such a tight control of the quinone passage into the binding chamber and mechanistic consequences for the quinone two-electron reduction.",

A critical component of all organs is the vasculature. Herein we discuss general strategies to create vascularized organoids including common source materials and survey previous work using vascularized organoids to recreate specific organ functions and simulate tumor progression. Vascularization is not only an essential component of individual organ function but also responsible for coupling the fate of all organs and their functions. While some success in coupling two or more organs together on a single platform has been demonstrated we argue that the future of vascularized organoid technology lies in creating organoid systems complete with tissue-specific microvasculature and in coupling multiple organs through a dynamic vascular network to create systems that can respond to changing physiological conditions.",

This study reports the PCR-based prevalence of Chlamydiaceae DNA that does not 100 match any avian or mammalian Chlamydiaceae in wild populations of hawks in California Buteo species. In this study multimucosal swab samples n 291 for quantitative PCR qPCR and plasma n 78 for serology were collected from wild hawks. All available plasma samples were negative for antibodies using a C. psittaci-specific elementary body agglutination test EBA n 78. For IgY antibodies all 51 available samples were negative using the indirect immunofluorescent assay. The overall prevalence of Chlamydiaceae DNA detection in wild Buteo species sampled was 1.37 4291 via qPCR-based analysis. Two fledgling Swainsons hawks Buteo swainsoni and two juvenile red-tailed hawks Buteo jamaicensis were positive by qPCR-based assay for an atypical chlamydial sequence that did not 100 match any known C. psittaci genotype. Positive swab samples from these four birds were sequenced based on the ompA gene and compared by high-resolution melt analysis with all known avian and mammalian Chlamydiaceae. The amplicon sequence did not 100 match any known avian chlamydial sequence however it was most similar 98.6 to C. psittaci M56 a genotype that is typically found in muskrats and hares. Culture and full genome sequence analysis of Chlamydia spp. isolated from diseased hawks will be necessary to classify this organism and to better understand its epizootiology and potential health impact on wild Buteo populations in California.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury in neonatal rats results in the death of the majority of the axotomized sensory neurons by 7 d after injury. In adult animals however all sensory neurons survive for at least 4 months after axotomy. How sensory neurons acquire the capacity to survive axonal injury is not known. Here we describe how the expression of the small heat shock protein 27 HSP27 is correlated with neuronal survival after axotomy in vivo and after NGF withdrawal in vitro. The number of HSP27-immunoreactive neurons in the L4 DRG is low at birth and does not change significantly for 21 d after postnatal day 0 P0 sciatic nerve axotomy. In contrast in the adult all axotomized neurons begin to express HSP27. One week after P0 sciatic nerve section the total number of neurons in the L4 DRG is dramatically reduced but all surviving axotomized neurons as identified by c-jun immunoreactivity are immunoreactive for HSP27. In addition terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling reveals that very few HSP27-expressing neurons are dying 48 hr after neonatal axotomy. In vitro a similar correlation exists between HSP27 expression and survival in P0 DRG cultures neurons that express HSP27 preferentially survive NGF withdrawal. Finally overexpression of human HSP27 in neonatal rat sensory and sympathetic neurons significantly increases survival after NGF withdrawal with nearly twice as many neurons surviving at 48 hr. Together these results suggest that HSP27 in sensory neurons plays a role in promoting survival after axotomy or neurotrophin withdrawal.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Carotid intervention in the form of endarterectomy or stenting is the current standard of care for the majority of patients with symptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis. However some randomised controlled trials RCT have demonstrated that women benefited significantly less from intervention than men. It is unclear if this is a true phenomenon or a study sampling artefact as women were severely under-represented in all RCTs of carotid revascularisation. A systematic review is needed to summarise the existing data and to answer the question of whether a women-only trial for symptomatic patients with ipsilateral carotid stenosis is scientifically necessary and ethically permissible. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically search Medline Embase PubMed and the Cochrane libraries for all studies with data from RCTs that included women and compared either endarterectomy with stenting or revascularisation by means of endarterectomy or stenting with medical therapy in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Search dates will be restricted to 1991-2018. Two reviewers will conduct screening search results study selection data extraction and quality assessment. We will include all studies reporting outcomes of interest. Planned subgroup analysis based on revascularisation technique degree of stenosis and timing of intervention from the index event will be conducted with enough data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This research is exempt of ethics approval as no primary data will be collected. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through national and international-level conferences and scientific meetings. The result of this comprehensive review will provide useful information on whether further RCTs are required to study a women-only population with symptomatic carotid disease.

    "abstract": "Heat waves HWs pose a significant threat to California agriculture with potential adverse effects on crop photosynthetic capacity quality and yield all of which contribute to significant economic loss. Lack of heat-resilient cultivars puts perennial crop production under severe threat due to increasing HW frequency duration and intensity. Currently available walnut cultivars are highly sensitive to abiotic stress and germplasm collections provide potential solutions via genotypes native to varied climates. We screened nine English walnut accessions Juglans regia for physiological heat stress resilience and recovery in the USDA-ARS National Clonal Germplasm over 2-years and identified accessions with superior resilience to heat stress. Heat stress impacted photosynthetic capacity in most accessions as evidenced by reductions in net An and maximum Amax assimilation rates quantum efficiency of PSII and changes in stomatal conductance gs. However two accessions exhibited either higher or complete recovery post-irrigation. This aligns with the established practice of using irrigation to mitigate heat stress as it improved recovery for several accessions with A3 and A5 demonstrating the most resilience. One of these two superior accessions is native to one of the hottest and driest habitats of all studied accessions. These same accessions exhibited the highest An under non-stressed conditions and at higher temperatures of 35 to 45C. Higher performance for A3 and A5 under HWs was associated with greater carboxylation rates electron transport rates and Amax. All accessions suffered significant declines in photosynthetic performance at 45C which were the ambient leaf temperatures approached during record-setting heat waves in California during September 2022.",

One important question is to what extent asphericity is common to all CC-SNe. Here we present late-time spectra for a number of CC-SNe from stripped-envelope stars and use them to explore any asphericity generated in the inner part of the exploding star near the site of collapse. A range of oxygen emission-line profiles is observed including a high incidence of double-peaked profiles a distinct signature of an aspherical explosion. Our results suggest that all CC-SNe from stripped-envelope stars are aspherical explosions and that SNe accompanied by GRBs exhibit the highest degree of asphericity.",

Initially our goal was eradication of MRSA from the hospital flora. Our approach was a immediate notification of all MRSA isolates by the microbiology laboratory b strict isolation c cohorting d bathing patients with an iodophor e surveillance cultures of patients and staff f treatment of all colonized persons and g strict isolation on readmission. Control of spread was achieved but eradication was not. In 1987 our strategy was modified in order to establish the least restrictive methods to maintain control of the spread of MRSA. After notification by the microbiology laboratory we now require a contact isolation b surveillance cultures of patients associated with each new case and c contact isolation for all MRSA patients on readmission. Strict isolation and employee culturing are used only during major outbreaks. We have averaged four new cases of MRSA per month over the 7-year period including four major outbreaks. Since 1987 we have averaged only three new cases per month with one major MRSA outbreak. Annual cost savings of greater than 50000 have been realized through the policy modifications. We conclude that the use of contact isolation with some modifications has saved time and money and has successfully controlled the spread of MRSA in our university hospital.",

Our recently published childhood Hodgkin lymphoma HL study identified a genome-wide significant association for another genetic variant rs3781093 in high linkage disequilibrium D1.0 R20.91 with rs3824662. We hypothesize that GATA3 is a pleiotropic locus associated with multiple childhood cancers.jatsp jatspMethods The study was performed by combining 3 cohorts of childhood cancer survivors the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study SJLIFE the original and expansion cohorts of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study CCSS. The CCSS original cohort had SNP array genotyping and imputation and the SJLIFE and CCSS expansion cohort underwent whole-genome sequencing. Associations between the variants mapped to GATA3 and risks of different cancer types were analyzed a specific cancer type was selected as the case group and all other unselected cancer types served as controls then repeated for 13 cancer types. Summary statistics were subsequently analyzed with the ASSET Association analysis for SubSETs method which is powerful for pooling association signals across multiple cancer types when true effects may exist only in a subset and be in opposite directions across cancer types.jatsp jatspResults Genotype data were available for 11623 childhood cancer survivors 5325 from the CCSS original cohort 2428 from the CCSS expansion cohort and 3870 from the SJLIFE all European ancestry were initially considered.

The frequencies of the effect allele C for rs3781093 in ALL cases 17.9 STS cases 17.8 and HL cases 12.5 relative to non-cancer community controls in the SJLIFE 15.6 and non-cancer gnomAD samples 14.9 corroborate this finding. In our combined dataset there were 1380 Hodgkin lymphoma cases 2961 ALL cases and 692 STS cases.jatsp jatspConclusion We discovered a novel variant in the GATA3 locus exhibiting pleiotropy with both tumor-promoting and protective effects suggesting a shared mechanistic pathway involving GATA3 may underlie the carcinogenesis for ALL STS and HL. Conducting systematic searches for childhood cancer pleiotropy represents an important research direction.jatsp jatspCitation Format Cheng Chen Xijun Zhang Qian Dong Heather L.

    "abstract": "The exposure of molecular signals for simian virus 40 SV40 cell entry and nuclear entry has been postulated to involve calcium coordination at two sites on the capsid made of Vp1. The role of calcium-binding site 2 in SV40 infection was examined by analyzing four single mutants of site 2 the Glu160Lys Glu160Arg Glu157Lys E157K and Glu157Arg mutants and an E157K-E330K combination mutant. The last three mutants were nonviable. All mutants replicated viral DNA normally and all except the last two produced particles containing all three capsid proteins and viral DNA. The defect of the site 1-site 2 E157K-E330K double mutant implies that at least one of the sites is required for particle assembly in vivo. The nonviable E157K particles about 10 larger in diameter than the wild type were able to enter cells but did not lead to T-antigen expression. Cell-internalized E157K DNA effectively coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Vp1 antibody but little of the DNA did so with anti-Vp3 antibody and none was detected in anti-importin immunoprecipitate. Yet a substantial amount of Vp3 was present in anti-Vp1 immune complexes suggesting that internalized E157K particles are ineffective at exposing Vp3. Our data show that E157K mutant infection is blocked at a stage prior to the interaction of the Vp3 nuclear localization signal with importins consistent with a role for calcium-binding site 2 in postentry steps leading to the nuclear import of the infecting SV40.",

In other words understanding the meaning of the various forms of written discourse employed in the creation discussion and communication of scientific knowledge is inherent to how science works. The language used in science however sets up a barrier that in order to be overcome requires all students to have a clear understanding of the features of the multimodal informational texts employed in science and the strategies they can use to decode the scientific concepts communicated in informational texts. We argue that all teachers of science must develop a functional understanding of reading comprehension as part of their professional knowledge and skill. After describing our rationale for including knowledge about reading as a professional knowledge base every teacher of science should have we outline the knowledge about language teachers must develop the knowledge about the challenges that reading comprehension of science texts poses for students and the knowledge about instructional strategies science teachers should know to support their students reading comprehension of science texts. Implications regarding the essential role that knowledge about reading should play in the preparation of science teachers are also discussed here.",

Methods Survey study performed at an urban university Level I trauma medical center. Results A total of 80 nurses 39 residents and 45 faculty completed the survey. All groups agreed that meth was a significant problem nationwide and in our emergency department ED. Nurses estimated that 33 of their patients used meth which differed from residents 18 and faculty 15. All agreed that these patients required more effort to care for utilized more hospital resources and were more often violent toward staff. Nurses reported higher prevalence of actual assault by patients using meth 70 than did residents 36 and faculty 47 and total lifetime number of assaults. All agreed that patients using meth appropriated prehospital resources at a higher rate than nonusers had a higher rate of recidivism and longer ED length of stay. Nurses preferred antipsychotics over benzodiazepines for treatment of meth-induced tachycardia and a lower threshold for treatment of associated hypertension than residents and faculty. For treatment of hypertension nurses preferred beta-blockers and hydralazine over benzodiazepines. Conclusion All agreed that meth use is a serious problem in our ED with high resource utilization recidivism and violence against staff. Nurses experienced higher rates of assaults by patients using meth and differed with regard to their disposition and treatment. Treatment guidelines strategies to mitigate violence towards staff and interprofessional education may be beneficial as the stakes of caring for these patients are high and preferences vary between caregivers.",

METHOD Customized 2017 and 2018 Medical School Graduation Questionnaires GQs were analyzed using independent samples t tests for means and chi-square tests for percentages comparing responses of accelerated MD program graduates accelerated pathway AP students from 9 schools with those of non-AP graduates from the same 9 schools and non-AP graduates from all surveyed schools. RESULTS GQ completion rates for the 90 AP students 2573 non-AP students from AP schools and 38116 non-AP students from all schools in 2017 and 2018 were 74.4 82.3 and 83.3 respectively. AP students were as satisfied with the quality of their education and felt as prepared for residency as non-AP students. AP students reported a more positive learning climate than non-AP students from AP schools and from all schools as measured by the student-faculty interaction 15.9 vs 14.4 and 14.3 respectively P .001 for both pairwise comparisons and emotional climate 10.7 vs 9.6 and 9.6 respectively P .004 and .003 respectively scales. AP students had less debt than non-AP students P .001 and more planned to care for underserved populations and practice family medicine than non-AP students from AP schools 55.7 vs 33.9 and 37.7 vs 9.4 P .002 and .001 respectively. Family expectations were a more common influence on career plans for AP students than for non-AP students from AP schools and from all schools 26.2 vs 11.3 and 11.7 respectively P .001 for both pairwise comparisons. CONCLUSIONS These findings support accelerated programs as a potentially important intervention to address workforce shortages and rising student debt without negative impacts on student perception of burnout education quality or residency preparedness.",

Twenty-four purpose bred research dogs Dogs were randomized to be ventilated by cuffed orotracheal tube tight fitting face mask mouth-to-nose breathing or compressions only during CPR n 6 in all groups. Orotracheal tube and face mask ventilation was performed on room air. Chest compressions were performed during the experimental procedure. Arterial blood gases were performed prior to euthanasia baseline at 3 min and at 6 min of CPR. PaO2 and PaCO2 were compared for each time point and each group. There was no difference in PaO2 or PaCO2 between groups at baseline. At 6 min all groups had a significantly higher PaCO2 P 0.005 and the facemask and compression only groups had a significantly lower PaO2 P 0.02 when compared to the orotracheal tube group. There was no difference between the PaO2 of the mouth-to-nose group compared to the orotracheal tube group at 3 or 6 min. Gastric distension regurgitation gas leakage around the mouth and ineffective breaths were all noted in both the face mask and mouth-to-nose group. The results of this study supports that orotracheal intubation is the preferred technique for ventilation during CPR in dogs. When orotracheal intubation is not possible face mask ventilation or mouth-to-nose ventilation would be reasonable alternatives. When oxygen supplementation is available face mask ventilation is likely to be superior. Appropriate training for both face mask and mouth-to-nose ventilation techniques is recommended.",

Mechanisms leading to these positive relationships include mate limitation saturating predation risk and cooperative breeding and foraging. Individuals within these populations may differ in age size or geographic location and thereby structure these populations. Here I study structured population models accounting for positive density-dependence and environmental stochasticity i.e. random fluctuations in the demographic rates of the population. Under an accessibility assumption roughly stochastic fluctuations can lead to populations getting small and large these models are shown to exhibit a dynamical trichotomy i for all initial conditions the population goes asymptotically extinct with probability one ii for all positive initial conditions the population persists and asymptotically exhibits unbounded growth and iii for all positive initial conditions there is a positive probability of asymptotic extinction and a complementary positive probability of unbounded growth. The main results are illustrated with applications to spatially structured populations with an Allee effect and age-structured populations experiencing mate limitation.",

    "abstract": "There has been resistance to COVID-19 public health restrictions partly due to changes and reductions in work resulting in financial stress. Psychological reactance theory posits that such restrictions to personal freedoms result in anger defiance and motivation to restore freedom. In an online study N 301 we manipulated the target of COVID-19 restrictions as impacting self or community. We hypothesized that a greater pandemic-related financial stress would predict greater reactance b the self-focused restriction condition would elicit greater reactance than the community-focused restriction condition c reactance would be greatest for financially-stressed individuals in the self-focused condition and d greater reactance would predict lower adherence to social distancing guidelines. Independent of political orientation and sense of community greater financial stress predicted greater reactance only in the self-focused condition the community-focused condition attenuated this association. Additionally greater reactance was associated with lower social distancing behavior. These findings suggest that economic hardship exacerbates negative responses to continued personal freedom loss. Community-focused COVID-19 health messaging may be better received during continued pandemic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The leaf epidermal anatomy of 15 salt-tolerant plant species belonging to the Amaranthaceae from the Salt Range of Punjab-Pakistan was studied using light microscopy LM. The main purpose of this investigation was to compare the leaf micro-morphologies of the studied taxa which can provide diagnostic characters useful for correct identification of halophytic taxa. Various quantitative and qualitative foliar epidermal features of adaxial and abaxial surfaces including epidermal cell shape anticlinal wall pattern lobes per cell anomocytic anisocytic and paracytic types of stomata and trichome diversity were studied. Eight types of trichomes reported for the halophytes studied i.e. stellate glandular conical capitate non-capitate non-glandular cylindrical and falcate. The shapes of epidermal cells found are pentagonal polygonal irregular wavy and tetragonal. This is the first report on leaf epidermal micromorphology of halophytes of family Amaranthaceae of Salt Range of Punjab. The findings revealed that leaf epidermal features showed adequate variations among genera distinguishing the halophytic taxa of family Amaranthaceae.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS Although results of surgical ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus PDA in the pediatric age group are excellent surgical management of the adult with a PDA may be more problematic. The PDA that presents in adulthood may be calcified and friable rendering simple ligation via a thoracotomy difficult inadequate and hazardous. Patch closure of the ductus arteriosus from either the aortic or pulmonary artery orifice using cardiopulmonary bypass or transient aortic cross-clamping is necessary but increases surgical risk. Furthermore older patients with diseases unrelated to their PDA and patients with Downs syndrome may have higher risks with intubation general anesthesia and surgery. Early results of percutaneous transcatheter occlusion of the PDA with Gianturco coils performed under sedation and local anesthesia are promising. METHODS Six adults with mean age of 39.1 years range 23.1-62.0 years were found to have an isolated PDA with mean minimum diameter of 2.7 mm range 1.0-5.0 mm at cardiac catheterization. All underwent percutaneous transcatheter occlusion of the PDA using Gianturco coils. RESULTS Coil implantation was successful in all patients. There were no complications and all were discharged home within 24 hours. Complete ductal occlusion was seen immediately in 4 of 6 patients 67 while 2 of 6 33 had small residual leaks. However complete occlusion was achieved in all patients by 6 months following the procedure. CONCLUSION Transcatheter occlusion of the PDA using coils is safe and efficacious in adults.",

    "abstract": "Polymerase chain reaction PCR based clonality assays are an important tool to differentiate neoplastic from reactive lymphocyte populations. A recent description of the canine T cell receptor locus identified a large number of formerly unknown genes and determined the locus topology consisting of 8 cassettes with up to 3 variable V genes 2 joining J genes and one constant C gene each. Given that these data were not available when existing canine T cell clonality assays were developed it is likely that they will fail to detect a subset of clonal lymphocyte populations. The objective of this study was to gauge the potential of canine T cell clonality assays to detect all rearranged T cell receptor genes and to develop an improved clonality assay. The primer sequences of existing clonality assays were aligned to the reference sequences of all rearranged genes and genes were scored as to the likelihood of being recognized by a primer. All four assays likely recognized subgroup V2 and V6 genes but 3 out of 4 assays were unlikely to detect subgroup V3 and V7 genes. All assays likely recognized Jx-2 genes but only two assays were likely to detect most Jx-1 genes. Two assays had forward primers located as close as four nucleotides to the junctional region. A new multiplex PCR was designed with all primers combined in a single tube. An alternative primer set allowed identification of variable gene usage through gene specific forward primers. The coverage of all rearranged genes facilitated the detection of multiple clonal rearrangements per neoplastic sample. The new assay detected clonal DNA at a concentration of 5 within polyclonal background but detection thresholds were dependent on the gene usage of clonal rearrangements as well as the position of the clonal peak in respect to the polyclonal background. The new multiplex assay recognized 1212 100 of confirmed neoplastic samples as compared to 212 17 by an existing assay. On a series of 60 diagnostic samples the concordance rate of both assays was 4160 68.3. In 1460 23.3 of the cases the new multiplex assay yielded a clonal result while the existing assay gave a non-clonal result. In 560 8.3 of cases the new assay yielded a non-clonal result while the existing primer set gave a clonal result. These findings suggest that the new multiplex assay has an improved sensitivity over traditional assays and is suited to reduce the rate of false-negative results.",

    "abstract": "Geolocators are small devices that record and store time-stamped light levels that researchers typically use to approximate the latitude and longitude of small birds across the annual cycle. However when geolocators are affixed to leg bands of larger-bodied birds nest incubation by females interrupts the daily pattern of light and darkness. Thus geolocators can provide information on nesting propensity nest success and renesting intensity these demographic parameters are both difficult to measure unobtrusively and are critically important in determining population dynamics of birds especially ducks. Here we deployed 240 geolocators on mottled ducks Anas fulvigula in Louisiana and Texas in 20182019 to evaluate their utility in providing nesting data. During July 2018January 2022 we recovered 16 geolocators from hunter-harvested birds and learned of 6 other unreported recoveries yielding a realized recovery rate of 7.1 9.1 unrealized. Three of the recovered units provided breeding-season data. Two of these clearly indicated a single nest initiation in the early spring of 2019 and one of the units also logged an attempt in spring of 2020. Ducks incubated all three nests for approximately a month suggesting that they all successfully hatched. The final geolocator logged five putative nest attempts over the course of 2 y. In 2019 both attempts were unsuccessful incubated 10 d. In 2020 we documented three attempts spanning 20 February10 June all of which appeared to have failed. For all failed attempts the hen left the nest at dusk or overnight and did not return which is suggestive of mammalian predation. Geolocators successfully provided information on breeding-season activities of mottled ducks and we documented renesting rates following nest depredation. However we achieved a smaller sample size than anticipated three usable returns resulting in an effective cost of 11800 per usable return. Where possible in other species capturing birds immediately prior to the breeding season and improvements to geolocator attachment have the potential to improve recovery rates and increase cost effectiveness of the technique.",

The purpose of this study was to define development of the BMZ in the trachea of growing rhesus monkeys at 1 2 3 and 6 mo of age. We measured immunoreactivity of collagen types I III and V to detect structural changes in the developing BMZ. To detect more dynamic functional components of the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit we evaluated the distribution of perlecan fibroblast growth factor-2 FGF-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 FGFR-1. One-month-old monkeys had a mean collagen BMZ width of 1.5 0.7 m that increased to 4.4 0.4 m in 6-mo-old monkeys. Perlecan was localized in the BMZ of the epithelium at all ages. FGF-2 was strongly expressed in basal cells at 1-3 mo. At 6 mo FGF-2 was expressed throughout the BMZ and weakly in basal cells. FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was expressed by basal cells and cilia and weakly in the nuclei of columnar cells at all time points. These data indicate that development of the BMZ is a postnatal event in the rhesus monkey that involves FGF-2.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND We identified commonly deficient standards across rectal cancer programs that underwent accreditation review by the National Accreditation Program for Rectal Cancer to evaluate for patterns of noncompliance. STUDY DESIGN With the use of the internal database of the American College of Surgeons programs that underwent accreditation review from 2018 to 2020 were evaluated. The occurrence and frequency of noncompliance with the standards using the 2017 standards manual were evaluated. Programs were further stratified based on the year of review annual rectal cancer volume and Commission on Cancer classification. RESULTS A total of 25 programs with annual rectal cancer volume from 14 to more than 200 cases per year underwent accreditation review. Only 2 programs achieved 100 compliance with all standards. Compliance with standards ranged from 48 to 100. The 2 standards with the lowest level of compliance included standard 2.5 and standard 2.11 that require all patients with rectal cancer to be discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting before the initiation of definitive treatment and within 4 weeks after definitive surgical therapy respectively. Patterns of noncompliance persisted when programs were stratified on the basis oof the year of survey annual rectal cancer volume and Commission on Cancer classification. The corrective action process allowed all programs to ultimately become successfully accredited. CONCLUSION During this initial phase of the National Accreditation Program for Rectal Cancer accreditation the majority of programs undergoing review did not achieve 100 compliance and went through a corrective action process. Although the minimal multidisciplinary team meeting attendance requirements were simplified in the 2021 revised standards noncompliance related to presentation of all patients at the multidisciplinary team meeting before and after definitive treatment highlights the need for programs seeking accreditation to implement optimized and standardized workflows to achieve compliance.",

The role of the Hh pathway in precursor B cell preB acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL the most common leukemia in children is unclear however recent reports suggest that Hh signaling is involved in the development of B cell precursors as well as the self-renewal and survival of B cell malignancies.jatsp jatspMXD3 is a transcription factor previously shown in our lab to be a novel member of the Hh pathway Yun Rust Ishimaru Diaz Mol Bio Cell 2007. We have previously shown that MXD3 is expressed in medulloblastoma the most common brain tumor in children and that its knockdown reduces proliferation of human medulloblastoma cell lines Barisone et al. PLoS 2012. In the current study we investigated a possible role for MXD3 in preB ALL cell proliferation. Using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR qRT-PCR we observed high levels of MXD3 mRNA expression in 8 primary preB ALL samples as well as in the preB ALL cell lines Reh and JM1. However MXD3 levels were very low in mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors mouse bone marrow and spleen. Indeed MXD3 levels in the primary ALL cells and cell lines ranged between 13 and 35 fold increase when compared to the normal cells. Immunoblot analysis with anti-MXD3 monoclonal antibodies confirmed that the protein was present in the ALL samples but not in normal cells. We investigated the role of MXD3 in cell proliferation and survival by silencing MXD3 in the Reh cell line. We used lentiviral delivery to knockdown MXD3 using an RNA interference approach. Briefly lentiviruses were produced carrying a short hairpin RNA sequence specific for MXD3 shMXD3 or a negative control sequence shCTRL. Upon transduction by the viral vector MXD3 knockdown was confirmed at both the RNA and protein level. Within 48 hours after transduction MXD3 protein levels were reduced gt90 in cells infected with the shMXD3 virus but not with the control virus. Interestingly MXD3 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation in Reh cells supporting our hypothesis that it may be involved in the maintenance of this malignancy. As a first step toward understanding the mechanisms by which MXD3 exerts its function in leukemia cells we analyzed cell cycle progression and apoptosis levels after knockdown using flow cytometry. We observed no significant differences in the G0G1 S or G2M populations between experimental and control samples. However samples where MXD3 had been knocked down showed higher levels of apoptosis when compared to controls.jatsp jatspTaken together our results suggest that MXD3 is important for preB ALL cell proliferation possibly by acting as an anti-apoptotic factor. Therefore MXD3 may represent a suitable candidate for future efforts in developing targeted therapies against preB ALL.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "In bacterial populations subtle expressional differences may promote ecological specialization through the formation of distinct ecotypes. In a barrier-free habitat this process most likely precedes population divergence and may predict speciation events. To examine this we used four sequenced strains of the bacterium Shewanella baltica OS155 OS185 OS195 and OS223 as models to assess transcriptional variation and ecotype formation within a prokaryotic population. All strains were isolated from different depths throughout a water column of the Baltic Sea occupying different ecological niches characterized by various abiotic parameters. Although the genome sequences are nearly 100 conserved when grown in the laboratory under standardized conditions all strains exhibited different growth rates suggesting significant expressional variation. Using the Ecotype Simulation algorithm all strains were considered to be discrete ecotypes when compared to 32 other S. baltica strains isolated from the same water column suggesting ecological divergence. Next we employed custom microarray slides containing oligonucleotide probes representing the core genome of OS155 OS185 OS195 and OS223 to detect natural transcriptional variation among strains grown under identical conditions. Significant transcriptional variation was noticed among all four strains. Differentially expressed gene profiles seemed to coincide with the metabolic signatures of the environment at the original isolation depth. Transcriptional pattern variations such as the ones highlighted here may be used as indicators of short-term evolution emerging from the formation of bacterial ecotypes. IMPORTANCE Eukaryotic studies have shown considerable transcriptional variation among individuals from the same population. It has been suggested that natural variation in eukaryotic gene expression may have significant evolutionary consequences and may explain large-scale phenotypic divergence of closely related species such as humans and chimpanzees M.-C. King and A. C. Wilson Science 188107-116 1975 httpdx.doi.org10.1126science.1090005 M. F. Oleksiak G. A. Churchill and D. L. Crawford Nat Genet 32261-266 2002 httpdx.doi.org10.1038ng983. However natural variation in gene expression is much less well understood in prokaryotic organisms. In this study we used four sequenced strains of the marine bacterium Shewanella baltica to better understand the natural transcriptional divergence of a stratified prokaryotic population. We found substantial low-magnitude expressional variation among the four S. baltica strains cultivated under identical laboratory conditions. Collectively our results indicate that transcriptional variation is an important factor for ecological speciation.",

Bifenthrin permethrin cyfluthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin were tested in all possible binary combinations across 6 experiments. All mixtures were analyzed for 4-d lethality and 2 of the 6 mixtures permethrin-bifenthrin and permethrin-cyfluthrin were tested for subchronic 10-d lethality and sublethal effects on swimming motility and growth. Mixtures were initially analyzed for interactions using regression analyses and subsequently compared with the additive models of concentration addition and independent action to further characterize mixture responses. Negative interactions antagonistic were significant in 2 of the 6 mixtures tested including cyfluthrin-bifenthrin and cyfluthrin-permethrin but only on the acute 4-d lethality endpoint. In both cases mixture responses fell between the additive models of concentration addition and independent action. All other mixtures were additive across 4-d lethality and bifenthrin-permethrin and cyfluthrin-permethrin were also additive in terms of subchronic 10-d lethality and sublethal responses.

In this same time period the focus of animal welfare science has shifted from concerns over mitigating negative welfare impacts to promoting positive welfare experiences for animals. For instance providing opportunities for animals to exert agency solve problems or acquire rewards are all associated with positive welfare outcomes. Many common age-related changes result in limitations to opportunities for positive welfare experiences either due to pain or other physical cognitive or behavioral limitations. This review aggregates information regarding common age-related physical and behavioral changes across species discusses how age-related changes may limit positive welfare opportunities of aged animals in human care and suggests potential management methods to help promote positive welfare for animals at all life stages in zoos and aquariums.",

Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006 Aina OH et al. Mol. Pharm. 2007. Using this method LLP2A a ligand against activated a4b1 integrin was discovered that targets malignant lymphoma with high affinity and specificity Peng L et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2008. We tested whether childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL cells expressed activated a4b1 integrin and bound to LLP2A using primary leukemia cells and leukemia cells engrafted in NODSCIDIL2Rg null NSG mice. Expression of activated a4b1 integrin was observed in three primary leukemia samples 1 T-ALL 1 precursor B preB ALL and 1 relapsed preB ALL by the rainbow beads color-coded polystyrene bead mixture displaying unique ligands against known receptors such as a4b1 a3b1 avb3 a5b1 integrins Luo J et al. J. Comb. Chem. 2008. To quantify activated a4b1 integrin expression primary leukemia cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using biotinylated LLP2Astreptavidin-PE. Nine samples 7 preB ALL and 2 relapsed preB ALL were analyzed. All samples except for one relapsed preB ALL sample showed expression of activated a4b1 integrin at different levels. In order to determine the specificity of activated a4b1 integrin expression hematopoietic stem cells from three normal bone marrow BM samples were analyzed and showed very low levels of activated a4b1 integrin expression. Furthermore we have identified 32 analogues of LLP2A using three fresh preB ALL samples to screen two LLP2A-focused libraries. Peptide microarrays using a polystyrene slide coated with neutravidin and biotinylated ligands will be prepared with these analogues. We will determine the binding affinity and specificity of these analogues to a series of primary ALL cells. Binding specificity to leukemia cells will be determined by excluding ligands which bind to normal hematopoietic progenitor CD34 cells. The property of the selected ligands will be tested in vivo using NSG mice engrafted with primary ALL cells. Updated results with these new ligands will be presented at the meeting.jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "With longer graft and patient survival recurrent disease is becoming recognized as an increasingly important contributor to long-term graft loss in renal transplant recipients. However patients may present for the first time in end-stage renal disease ESRD leading to uncertainty as to their underlying diagnosis and the risk of recurrence. The purpose of this study was to describe the features of children who presented for the first time in ESRD and to determine the predictive value of investigations in differentiating diseases with and without a recurrence risk. From 799 to 1104 13 children presented to our center in ESRD. Their median age was 13.3 yr 77 were male. The majority were hypertensive 77 and oligoanuric 69. All had proteinuria median urine protein to creatinine ratio Upc 7.0 and 92 had microhematuria. Only seven had small kidneys on ultrasound. All children underwent a serologic work-up and six 46 were biopsied. Of the 13 children seven had a glomerular disease in five the diagnosis was made on biopsy in one on serologic testing and one by family history. Of the remaining six children three had non-glomerular diseases obstructive uropathy in one and primary hyperoxaluria type 1 in two and 3 had an unknown disease. When patients with glomerular diseases were compared with those with non-glomerular diseases the two predictors for glomerular disease were a lower serum albumin p 0.004 and a higher serum bicarbonate level p 0.01. Comparing patients with and without a risk of recurrence there were no differences between the two groups in any of their demographic clinical or biochemical parameters by analysis of variance including serum albumin or proteinuria. In summary the vast majority of children presenting in ESRD have hematuria and proteinuria even with non-glomerular diseases. The significant overlap in clinical features between patients with and without a risk of recurrence emphasizes the need for all children presenting in ESRD to be evaluated extensively so that disease recurrence after transplantation can be anticipated or even prevented.",

OBJECTIVE The objective was to compare the efficacy and acceptability of Sprinkles SP crushable Nutritabs NT and fat-based Nutributter NB 108 kcald which provide 6 16 and 19 vitamins and minerals respectively when used for home fortification of complementary foods. DESIGN Ghanaian infants were randomly assigned to receive SP n 105 NT n 105 or NB n 103 daily from 6 to 12 mo of age. We assessed dietary intake morbidity and compliance weekly. Hemoglobin and plasma ferritin TfR C-reactive protein and zinc were measured at 6 and 12 mo. We used an exit interview to assess acceptability. A randomly selected control group of infants who received no intervention NI n 96 were assessed at 12 mo. RESULTS All supplements were well accepted and the mean percentage of days that supplements were consumed 87 did not differ between groups. At 12 mo all 3 intervention groups had significantly higher ferritin and lower TfR concentrations than did the NI control group. Mean - SD hemoglobin was significantly higher in NT 112 - 14 gL and NB 114 - 14 gL but not in SP 110 - 14 gL infants than in NI infants 106 - 14 gL. The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 31 in the NI control group compared with 10 in the intervention groups combined P 0.0001. CONCLUSION All 3 options for home fortification of complementary foods are effective for reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency in such populations.",

We present Noncespaces a technique that enables web clients to distinguish between trusted and untrusted content to prevent exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities. Using Noncespaces a web application randomizes the the XHTML tags and attributes in each document before delivering it to the client. As long as the attacker is unable to guess the random mapping the client can distinguish between trusted content created by the web application and untrusted content provided by an attacker. To implement Noncespaces with minimal changes to web applications we leverage a popular web application architecture to automatically apply Noncespaces to static content processed through a popular PHP template engine.

METHODS Preretinal membranes were collected during surgical vitrectomies after obtaining consents. The membranes were fixed processed sectioned and protein expression of EMP2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The staining intensity SI and percentage of positive cells PP in membranes were compared by masked observers. Membranes were categorized by their cause and type including inflammatory and traumatic. RESULTS All of the membranes stained positive for EMP2. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy-induced membranes all causes showed greater expression of EMP2 than ERMs with higher SI 1.81 vs. 1.38 P 0.07 and PP 2.08 vs. 1.54 P 0.09. However all the PVR subgroups had similar levels of EMP2 expression without statistically significant differences by Kruskal-Wallis test. Inflammatory PVR had higher expression of EMP2 than ERMs SI of 2.58 vs. 1.38 however this was not statistically significant. No correlation was found between duration of PVR membrane and EMP2 expression. EMP2 was detected by RT-PCR in all samples n 6 tested. CONCLUSIONS All studied ERMs and PVR membranes express EMP2. Levels of EMP2 trended higher in all PVR subgroups than in ERMs especially in inflammatory and traumatic PVR. Future studies are needed to determine the role of EMP2 in the pathogenesis and treatment of various retinal conditions including PVR.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of long-term catheterization of fetal placental vessels. METHODS A midline laparotomy was performed in 4 time-mated pregnant ewes at 125 days gestation term 145 days. Placental vessels were exposed by a small uterine incision. A specially designed catheter was inserted into a placental vessel over a length of 3 cm the distal end of the catheter was tunneled underneath the maternal skin and attached to a subcutaneous port implanted in the maternal flank. All pregnancies were allowed to go to term. RESULTS Ewes and fetuses tolerated the placement of the catheter and port without complications. The catheter remained patent in all cases. All lambs were delivered vaginally at term and did not require resuscitation after birth. No fetal anomalies or growth restriction were noted. CONCLUSION The ovine placental vessel can be accessed long term without complication.",

Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine risk factors associated with CAT and the effect of CAT on all-cause mortality. 942 019 patients with cancer were identified 62 003 6.6 had an incident diagnosis of CAT. Patients with pancreatic brain ovarian and lung cancer had the highest and patients with breast and prostate cancer had the lowest 12-month cumulative incidence of CAT. For most malignancies men those with metastatic disease and more comorbidities and African Americans vs non-Hispanic Whites were at highest risk for CAT. Patients diagnosed with cancer between 2014 and 2017 had a higher risk of CAT compared with those diagnosed between 2005 and 2007. CAT was associated with increased overall mortality for all malignancies HR ranges 1.89 to 4.79. The incidence of CAT increased over time and was driven by an increase in pulmonary embolismdeep vein thrombosis PEDVT. CAT incidence varies based on tumor type and stage and on individual risk factors including gender raceethnicity and comorbidities. For all tumor types CAT is associated with an increased mortality.",

The aim of this study was to assess current standard of care SOC for early ICU exercise programs in major burn centers. We designed a survey investigating exercise RP on the ICU for burn patients with 30 total burned surface area. The survey was composed of 23 questions and submitted electronically via SurveyMonkey to six major pediatric and adult burn centers in Texas and California. All centers responded and reported exercise as part of their RP on the ICU. The characteristics of exercises implemented were not uniform. All centers reported to perform resistive and aerobic exercises but only 83 reported isotonic and isometric exercises. Determination of intensity of exercise varied with 50 of centers using patient tolerance and 17 using vital signs. Frequency of isotonic isometric aerobic and resistive exercise was reported as daily by 80 80 83 and 50 of centers respectively. Duration for all types of exercises was extremely variable. Mobilization was used as a form of exercise by 100 of burn centers. Our results demonstrate that although early RP seem to be integral during burn survivors ICU stay no SOC exists. Moreover early RP are inconsistently administered and large variations exist in frequency intensity duration and type of exercise. Thus future prospective studies investigating the various components of exercise interventions are needed to establish a SOC and determine how and if early exercise benefits the burn survivor.",

    "abstract": "Reductions in cellular oxygen consumption Vo2 and reactive oxygen species ROS production have been proposed as mechanisms underlying the anti-aging effects of calorie restriction CR. Mitochondria are a cells greatest sink for oxygen and also its primary source of ROS. The mitochondrial proton leak pathway is responsible for 20-30 of Vo2 in resting cells. We hypothesized that CR leads to decreased proton leak with consequential decreases in Vo2 ROS production and cellular damage. Here we report the effects of short-term 2-wk 2-mo and medium-term 6-mo CR 40 on rat muscle mitochondrial proton leak ROS production and whole animal Vo2. Whole body Vo2 decreased with CR at all time points whereas mass-adjusted Vo2 was normal until the 6-mo time point when it was 40 lower in CR compared with control rats. At all time points maximal leak-dependent Vo2 was lower in CR rats compared with controls. Proton leak kinetics indicated that mechanisms of adaptation to CR were different between short- and medium-term treatments with the former leading to decreases in protonmotive force Deltap and state 4 Vo2 and the latter to increases in Deltap and decreases in state 4 Vo2. Results from metabolic control analyses of oxidative phosphorylation are consistent with the idea that short- and medium-term responses are distinct. Mitochondrial H2O2 production was lower in all three CR groups compared with controls. Overall this study details the rapid effects of short- and medium-term CR on proton leak ROS production and metabolic control of oxidative phosphorylation. Results indicate that a reduction in mitochondrial Vo2 and ROS production may be a mechanism for the actions of CR.",

These spillover events underlie the importance of detecting known and novel CoVs circulating in reservoir host species and determining CoV prevalence and distribution allowing improved prediction of spillover events or where a human-reservoir interface should be closely monitored. To increase the likelihood of detecting all circulating genera and strains we have modified primers published by Watanabe et al. in 2010 to generate a semi-nested pan-CoV PCR assay. Representatives from the four coronavirus genera -CoVs -CoVs -CoVs and -CoVs were tested and all of the in-house CoVs were detected using this assay. After comparing both assays we found that the updated assay reliably detected viruses in all genera of CoVs with high sensitivity whereas the sensitivity of the original assay was lower. Our updated PCR assay is an important tool to detect monitor and track CoVs to enhance viral surveillance in reservoir hosts.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how honey bee population dynamics the scale and timing of almond bloom and unmarketability of almond honey interact to create misaligned incentives for growers and beekeepers in the California almond pollination services market. We combine economic contract theory with data from the first pollination contract survey to examine the design of pollination contracts. 89.2 of respondents used contracts with minimum colony population requirements suggesting that all colonies are not considered to be equal providers of pollination services. Contracts that involved enforcement every year provided the highest pollination fees on average while those with no enforcement provided the lowest fees. We contribute to the literature regarding pollination services by demonstrating that the number of hives and price per hive present an incomplete picture of almond pollination transactions without information regarding colony strength requirements and enforcement. We also provide a theoretical rationale for why almond pollination agreements have anecdotally become more formal over time as the marginal value of colony strength increases the grower offers the beekeeper stronger incentives to provide high colony strength. California almond production is an extreme case of a crop relying almost solely on managed pollinators but ultimately could reflect the future for many pollinator-dependent crops if pollinator populations continue to decrease while monoculture crop production increases.",

Here we successfully introduced a flexible supercapacitive sensing modality to all-fabric materials for wearable pressure and force sensing using an elastic ionic-electronic interface. Notably an electrospun ionic fabric utilizing nanofibrous structures offers an extraordinarily high pressure-to-capacitance sensitivity 114 nF kPa-1 which is at least 1000 times higher than any existing capacitive sensors and one order of magnitude higher than the previously reported ionic devices with a pressure resolution of 2.4 Pa achieving high levels of noise immunity and signal stability for wearable applications. In addition its fabrication process is fully compatible with existing industrial manufacturing and can lead to cost-effective production for its utility in emerging wearable uses in a foreseeable future.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic focused national attention on food insecurity equity and the role of school meal programs in supporting children families and communities. In doing so the pandemic created a rare policy window-an opportunity to advance a longstanding public health goal of guaranteed access to free school meals for all students. In July 2021 California and Maine became the first states to authorize school meal for all legislation also known as universal free meals. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore perspectives of policymakers state agency officials and advocates on the conditions and mechanisms that facilitated passage of school meal for all legislation in California and Maine. DESIGN A qualitative case study was conducted. PARTICIPANTS Between December 2021 and June 2022 semistructured interviews were conducted with 30 policymakers state agency officials and advocates. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED Interviews were analyzed using principles of content analysis. Key themes are organized using Kingdons multiple streams framework for public policy. RESULTS Eleven key themes were identified. Lessons are drawn from the policy and advocacy strategies used to advance laws in California and Maine. For instance paving the way with incremental policy change tailoring messaging to diverse audiences and organizing at the grassroots and grasstops levels were critical to success of advocacy efforts. CONCLUSIONS Promising practices can guide efforts to expand access to school meals and advance other child nutrition policies in other states and nationally. Moving forward lessons learned from implementation of universal free school meal legislation in California Maine and other early adopters should be documented and shared.",

DNA extraction methods included enzymatic lysis boiling for 30 min followed by enzymatic lysis four cycles of freezing and thawing followed by enzymatic lysis and bead beating followed by enzymatic lysis. The DNA yield and purity for the four methods were evaluated by spectrophotometry and compared. The bead beating with enzymatic lysis technique yielded significantly purer and higher concentrations of extracted DNA compared with other DNA extraction methods. All four methods yielded extraction products for all three organisms that were successfully amplified by polymerase chain reaction PCR for a fragment in the 65-kD heat shock protein gene. Subjectively the PCR amplification products were most abundant for samples extracted by bead beating with enzymatic lysis.",

    "abstract": "Objective In 2017 residents at the Harvard Combined Orthopaedic Residency Program HCORP performed in the 6th percentile on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination OITE compared to other Allopathic programs. The following academic year a focused exam review curriculum was instituted to improve OITE scores. The main objective of this study was to determine whether or not implementation of a resident-led question-based review curriculum would help improve resident performance on the in-training exam. Design This is a retrospective cohort study comparing exam performance between postgraduate year PGY 2 to 5 residents who took the 2017 OITE pre-curriculum cohort to those who took the 2018 OITE post-curriculum cohort. Setting This study enrolled all PGY2-5 residents from the Harvard Combined Orthopaedic Residency Program HCORP located in Boston Massachusetts. The OITE review curriculum was taught at the Brigham and Womens Hospital BWH where HCORPs weekly didactic conference is held. Participants All PGY2-5 residents in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 academic years were enrolled in the study. PGY1 residents did not consistently attend HCORPs weekly didactic conference and therefore were excluded. Forty-nine residents who took the 2017 OITE 2017 cohort were compared to 46 residents who took the 2018 OITE 2018 cohort. Results Residents who participated in the OITE review curriculum placed greater emphasis on the OITE and completed more questions in preparation for the in-training exam p0.001. The 2017 cohort got 64.9 of the questions correct 175.8 of 271 questions compared to 70.2 in the 2018 cohort 188.9 of 269 questions p0.001. The 2017 cohort placed in the 6th percentile among Allopathic programs 157 programs and 22nd percentile among all programs 237 programs. The 2018 cohort placed in the 73rd percentile among Allopathic programs 160 programs and 76th percentile among all programs 238 programs. Conclusions The OITE review curriculum significantly increased the residents mean percentage of questions answered correctly while improving HCORP performance from the 6th to the 73rd percentile among Allopathic orthopaedic programs. Instituting a focused OITE review curriculum is an effective strategy to improving OITE scores.",

This greatly simplifies the equations of motion for space-times of this form such as Robertson-Walker and Schwarzschild.

    "abstract": "In this work intermolecular distance was integrated into the docking of protein-protein complexes. To develop an efficient docking procedure 22 enzyme-inhibitor targets and 15 antibody-antigen targets were taken from a benchmark set. A three-step approach was adopted which included global sampling by FTDOCK filtering by intermolecular distance and ranking by a composite scoring function. For the enzyme-inhibitor targets the composite scoring function consists of geometry and energy terms. In the set composed of the approximately 100 highest ranked candidates for each target correct complexes were identified for all of the 22 enzyme-inhibitor targets. This docking strategy also succeeded on the four test targets of which three are CAPRI targets with the same receptor but different binding modes. Interestingly all three binding modes were correctly predicted. For the antibody-antigen targets CDR and physical energy were also used in the filtering process and informatics terms were added to the scoring function. The composite score had successful prediction for 13 of the 15 antibody-antigen targets.",

    "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in reciprocal social interaction deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication and a restricted repertoire of activities or interests. We performed a magnetic resonance imaging study to better define the neuropathology of autistic spectrum disorders. Here we report findings on the amygdala and the hippocampal formation. Borders of the amygdala hippocampus and cerebrum were defined and their volumes were measured in male children 7.5-18.5 years of age in four diagnostic groups autism with mental retardation autism without mental retardation Asperger syndrome and age-matched typically developing controls. Although there were no differences between groups in terms of total cerebral volume children with autism 7.5-12.5 years of age had larger right and left amygdala volumes than control children. There were no differences in amygdala volume between the adolescent groups 12.75-18.5 years of age. Interestingly the amygdala in typically developing children increases substantially in volume from 7.5 to 18.5 years of age. Thus the amygdala in children with autism is initially larger but does not undergo the age-related increase observed in typically developing children. Children with autism with and without mental retardation also had a larger right hippocampal volume than typically developing controls even after controlling for total cerebral volume. Children with autism but without mental retardation also had a larger left hippocampal volume relative to controls. These cross-sectional findings indicate an abnormal program of early amygdala development in autism and an abnormal pattern of hippocampal development that persists through adolescence. The cause of amygdala and hippocampal abnormalities in autism is currently unknown.",

Diet quality is a direct input to health is often used as a proxy for well-being and is an outcome variable for a wide variety of economic interventions. For the population as a whole we find significant improvements across all levels of diet quality. Further we find improvements for both low-income and higher-income individuals alike. Counterfactual distributions of dietary quality are constructed to investigate the extent to which observed improvements can be attributed to changes in the nutritional content of foods and to changes in population characteristics. We find that 63 of the improvement for all adults can be attributed to changes in food formulation and demographics. Changes in food formulation account for a substantially larger percentage of the dietary improvement within the lower-income population 19.6 vs. the higher-income population 6.4. The Author 2013.",

    "abstract": "Nebular-phase spectra of SN 2006aj discovered in coincidence with XRF 060218 were obtained with Keck in 2006 July and VLT in 2006 September. At the latter epoch spectropolarimetry was also attempted yielding a polarization upper limit of 2. The spectra show strong OI and Mg I emission lines as expected in Type Ic supernovae but weak Ca n lines. The Fe II lines that were strong in SN 1998bw are much weaker in SN 2006aj consistent with its lower luminosity. The outer velocity of the line-emitting region is 8000 km s-1 in July and 7400 km s-1 in September consistent with the relatively low expansion kinetic energy of SN 2006aj. All lines have similar width and their profiles indicate that no major asymmetries are present in the ejecta at velocities below v 8000 km s-1 except perhaps in the innermost part. The spectra were modeled with a non-LTE code. The mass of 56Ni required to power the emission is 0.20 M confirming earlier results based on the light curve. The oxygen mass is 1.5 M again much less than in SN 1998bw but 0.7 M larger than the value derived from the early-time modeling. The ejected mass below 8000 km s-1 is 2 M confirming that SN 2006aj was only about twice as massive and energetic as the normal Type Ic SN 19941. The presence of a dense inner core containing 1 M of mostly oxygen and carbon is inferred as in all broad-lined SNe Ic. This core which may be disklike is too deep to influence the early light curve and too small to affect the late polarization spectrum. 2007. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.",

We present a KeckEchelle Spectrograph and Imager longslit spectroscopy for 27 isolated galaxies in this regime 20 quiescent galaxies and 7 star-forming galaxies. We measure emission line strengths as a function of radius and place galaxies on the Baldwin Phillips Terlevich BPT diagram. Remarkably 16 of 20 quiescent galaxies in our sample host central active galactic nucleus AGN- like line ratios. Only five of these quiescent galaxies were identified as AGN-like in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey due to a lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that many of the quiescent galaxies in our sample have spatially extended emission across the non-star-forming regions of BPT-space. While quenched galaxies in denser environments in this mass range often show no evidence for AGN activity a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies in isolation host AGNs despite their overall passive appearances.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND A century of studies have described particular aspects of relatively few mosquito species in southern Africa mostly those species involved with disease transmission specifically malaria and arboviruses. Patterns of community composition such as mosquito abundance and species diversity are often useful measures for medical entomologists to guide broader insights and projections regarding disease dynamics and potential introduction spread or maintenance of globally spreading pathogens. However little research has addressed these indicators in southern Africa. RESULTS We collected 7882 mosquitoes from net and light traps at 11 localities comprising 66 species in 8 genera. We collected an additional 8 species using supplementary collection techniques such as larval sampling sweep-netting and indoor pyrethrum knockdown catches. Highest diversity and species richness was found in the Okavango Delta of Botswana and in South Africas Kruger National Park while the lowest diversity and abundances were in the extreme southern tip of South Africa and in semi-desert Kalahari close to the South Africa border with Botswana. Species composition was more similar between proximal localities than distant ones Linear model P-value 0.005. Multiple arbovirus vector species were detected in all localities we surveyed proportion of vector mosquito numbers were 0.5 in all locations except Shingwedzi. Their proportions were highest 90 in Vilankulo and Kogelberg. CONCLUSIONS Multiple known arbovirus vector species were found in all study sites whereas anopheline human malaria vector species in only some sites. The combination of net traps and light traps effectively sampled mosquito species attracted to carbon-dioxide or light accounting for 89 of the 74 species collected. The 11 remaining species were collected using supplementary collection techniques mentioned above. The diversity of species weas highest in savanna type habitats whereas low diversities were found in the drier Kalahari sands regions and the southern Cape fynbos regions.",

The characterization of this reaction and the atomic rearrangement in the intermediates and products at quantum mechanical level were performed for the two reaction paths found previously i direct dehydroxylation through the octahedral hole cross mechanism or between contiguous hydroxyl groups on-site mechanism and ii two-step dehydroxylation assisted by apical oxygens for each of the two steps. New intermediates were found and determined structurally. The structural variations found for all intermediates and transition states are in agreement with experimental results. The formation of these structures indicates that the dehydroxylation process is much more complex than a first-order reaction and can explain the wide range of temperatures for completing the reaction and these results can be extrapolated to the dehydroxylation of other dioctahedral 21 phyllosilicates.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates comprehensive operation and experimentation of an all-optical packet switching router with optical label swapping and reamplification and reshaping 2R regeneration capable of multihop operation and Internet protocol IP-client interoperability. In particular the experiment demonstrates successful packet switching and transport up to 11 hops with 10-9 bit-error rate and error-free up to four hops. Furthermore this paper demonstrates the optical label switching OLS core router and edge routers working together to support IP-client-to-IP-cIient packet transport and switching across the optical label switching network. The edge router generates an optical label based on the IP header content of the packet and generates an optical label encoded packet which subsequently ingresses into the OLS network. The optical label switching router OLSR forwards the packet with all-optical label swapping at each hop with 2R regeneration. The 2R regeneration leads to an experimentally measured negative penalty and a successful experimental demonstration of multihop cascaded OLSR operation with the edge routers interfacing with IP clients. The successful IP-client-to-IP-client packet forwarding via the edge routers and the cascaded multihop OLSR with all-optical label swapping indicate the viability of OLS in the scalable and transparent IP-over-optical Internet.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether the cumulative effects of head impacts from a season of high school football produce magnetic resonance imaging MRI measureable changes in the brain in the absence of clinically diagnosed concussion. Players from a local high school football team were instrumented with the Head Impact Telemetry System HITS during all practices and games. All players received pre- and postseason MRI including diffusion tensor imaging DTI. Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing ImPACT was also conducted. Total impacts and risk-weighted cumulative exposure RWE including linear RWELinear rotational RWERotational and combined components RWECP were computed from the sensor data. Fractional linear planar and spherical anisotropies FA CL CP and CS respectively as well as mean diffusivity MD were used to determine total number of abnormal white matter voxels defined as 2 standard deviations above or below the group mean. Delta post-preseason ImPACT scores for each individual were computed and compared to the DTI measures using Spearmans rank correlation coefficient. None of the players analyzed experienced clinical concussion N24. Regression analysis revealed a statistically significant linear relationship between RWECP and FA. Secondary analyses demonstrated additional statistically significant linear associations between RWE RWECP and RWELinear and all DTI measures. There was also a strong correlation between DTI measures and change in Verbal Memory subscore of the ImPACT. We demonstrate that a single season of football can produce brain MRI changes in the absence of clinical concussion. Similar brain MRI changes have been previously associated with mild traumatic brain injury.",

    "abstract": "As the worlds most ubiquitous carnivore domestic dogs maintain unique proximity to human populations. Partly because dogs potentially serve as hosts of zoonotic diseases determinants of canine health are increasingly the focus of interdisciplinary research. Emerging perspectives suggest that dogs health may vary as a function of their owners wealth and financial resources a correlation that could potentially inform public health programs and conservation efforts. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between household wealth and the health of domestic dogs n 208 among indigenous Mayangna communities in the Bosaws Biosphere Reserve Nicaragua. The dogs were evaluated using serum biochemistry complete blood count and physical exam findings. Using these data a principal components analysis PCA determined the presence of four syndromes 1 decreased body condition score BCS hypoalbuminemia 2 lymphocytosis eosinophilia 3 segmented neutrophilia and 4 lymphadenopathy tick infestation hyperglobulinemia. An inventory of possessions indexed household wealth. For all four syndromes household wealth was a weak and uninformative predictor of the dogs health. The few differences seen among dogs from households with different degrees of wealth likely reflect that nearly all dogs had marginal health and all households were relatively poor. Results from this study imply that owners wealth may have diverse effects on canine health in rural settings.",

    "abstract": "The structure of CuAsTe glasses is investigated using a combination of 65Cu Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR and Raman spectroscopy. A comparison of 65Cu NMR spectra from a series of glasses and two reference crystalline phases CuInTe2 and CuGaTe2 reveals that Cu in all glasses invariably adopts a tetrahedral coordination with Te. This assignment is consistent with the presence of a sharp CuTe4 tetrahedral mode in all CuAsTe Raman spectra. The Raman spectra of CuAsTe and GeAsTe glasses of identical compositions suggest that the short range order of As and Te is the same in both systems. 125Te NMR results corroborate this hypothesis. However the breach in chemical order commonly observed in GeAsTe does not appear to occur in CuAsTe. The variation in glass transition temperature with composition shows identical trends for CuAsTe and GeAsTe glasses however the density trends for these two systems show dramatic differences. Such trends are partly controlled by the difference in chemical order in these telluride glasses.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Readmissions are common after coronary artery bypass grafting CABG surgery and account for a significant percentage of hospital healthcare costs. Readmission rates also vary widely between hospitals but the reasons for this variation have not been studied previously. METHODS AND RESULTS We linked 2009 California CABG clinical registry data to hospital discharge data for 2009 and 2010 to identify 30-day readmissions for all patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Both standard and hierarchical logistic models were developed to predict readmission risk and explore sources of hospital readmission variation. Among 11 823 patients discharged alive after isolated CABG in 2009 1565 13.2 patients were readmitted within 30 days of surgery. Heart failure and postoperative infections were the most frequent reasons for readmission 15.3 and 12.9 respectively. Multiple patient risk factors including age sex and lower zip code-level median household income were significant predictors of readmission all adjusted odds ratios 1.0 P0.05. The readmission rates among the 119 hospitals performing CABG varied from 0 to 26.9. Compared with hospitals in lower quartiles for readmission hospitals in higher quartiles had a significantly higher readmission rates due to circulatory diseases infections complications for surgical and medical care and digestive diseases all P0.05. In a hierarchical model including several hospital characteristics hospital-level variables did not predict readmission risk all P0.05 with an intraclass correlation of 0.004 for hospitals. CONCLUSIONS California hospitals performing CABG surgery vary widely in 30-day readmission rates. Patient demographic and clinical risk factors rather than measured hospital characteristics accounted for most of the observed hospital-level variation in CABG readmissions.",

The current study tested the basis for knowledge-action dissociations in a card-sorting task in which children typically correctly answer questions about sorting rules while sorting cards incorrectly. When questions and sorting measures were more closely equated for the amount of conflict that needed to be resolved for a correct response children showed no systematic dissociation between knowledge and action.

It provides polynomial-time embedding of arbitrary linear programs and integer programs in such slim transportation programs and in bipartite biflow programs. It resolves several standing problems on 3-way transportation polytopes. It demonstrates that the range of values an entry can attain in any slim 3-way contingency table with specified 2-margins can contain arbitrary gaps suggesting that disclosure of fc-margins of d-tables for 2 k d is confidential. Our construction also provides a powerful tool in studying concrete questions about transportation polytopes and contingency tables remarkably it enables to automatically recover the famous real-feasible integer-infeasible 6 x 4 x 3 transportation polytope of M.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Femoral fractures are often catastrophic in large animals. Radiographic diagnosis is limited by patient size and feasibility especially in ambulatory settings. Ultrasonography is widely available and may provide an alternative to radiography for definitive diagnosis. ANIMALS 12 large animals 6 horses 5 cattle and 1 elephant. PROCEDURES Retrospective analysis of large animal patients diagnosed with femoral fracture by use of femoropelvic ultrasonography 2000 to 2019. RESULTS 5 of 12 cases were 1 year of age. The remaining 7 cases were 2 to 33 years of age median 13 years. All patients developed severe acute lameness after falling n 4 limb entrapment 2 dystocia 1 vehicular collision 1 ipsilateral full limb casting 1 or unknown events 3. All were non-weight-bearing or lame at the walk including 2 recumbent cattle. Ten cases showed upper limb swelling that was variable in location and 3 had nonspecific upper limb crepitus. Ultrasonography revealed evidence of diaphyseal n 6 greater trochanteric 2 capital physeal 2 and distal femoral 2 fractures. Fracture movement during limb manipulation or weight shifting was sonographically visualized in 5 animals. Radiography confirmed fractures in 3 of 8 animals 2 bovines with distal femoral fractures detected on standing projections and 1 capital physeal fracture that required ventrodorsal projections under general anesthesia. All animals were euthanized 11 or slaughtered 1 bovine. Postmortem examination confirmed ultrasonographic findings in 10 of 10 necropsied animals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Femoral fractures were not localized nor confirmed in any case prior to ultrasonography. Study findings supported the use of ultrasonography for rapid patient-side diagnosis prognostication and decision-making in suspect cases.",

Whether all men with prostate cancer require immediate treatment or whether men with tumors of low malignant potential are being overtreated with potentially harmful therapies is a subject of much debate. Results from a randomized trial that compared watchful waiting and active therapy showed all-cause and disease-specific survival advantages with radical therapy but the study group was mixed in terms of disease risk the optimum treatment strategy for men with low risk features remains unclear. Multiple centers are gaining experience with active surveillance and delayed intervention with curative intent for men with prostate tumors of potentially low clinical risk. This Review describes the background studies behind the rationale for active surveillance thoughts on selection criteria for candidates and some early reported outcomes for active surveillance cohorts. The psychosocial impact of active surveillance on patients is discussed as well as contemporary methods for disease monitoring.",

    "abstract": "OBJECT Symptomatic sellar arachnoid cysts ACs have typically been treated via the transsphenoidal route. After sellar cyst wall fenestration some authors have advocated cyst wall resection and increasing communication between the AC and suprasellar subarachnoid space SAS. This study is a report of the authors experience using a simplified approach to reinforce a defective diaphragma sellae or unseen arachnoid diverticulum by deliberately not enlarging the AC-SAS communication and obliterating the cyst cavity with adipose tissue followed by skull base reconstruction. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients who underwent an endonasal transsphenoidal obliteration of symptomatic ACs with a fat graft and skull base repair. RESULTS Between July 1998 and September 2010 8 patients with a sellar AC were identified 6 women and 2 men mean age 57 years. Clinical presentation included headache pituitary dysfunction and visual dysfunction 4 patients each group. Maximal cyst diameter averaged 22 mm range 15-32 mm. In all cases the sellar communication to the SAS was deliberately not enlarged. The endoscope was used for visualization in 8 of 9 procedures. Postoperatively headache improved in all 4 patients vision in all 4 patients and partial resolution of endocrine dysfunction hyperprolactinemia andor recurrent hyponatremia occurred in 3 75 of 4 patients. No new endocrinopathy CSF leak meningitis or neurological deficits occurred. Two patients experienced cyst reaccumulation 1 symptomatic recurrence was treated with reoperation at 43 months postsurgery and 1 asymptomatic partial recurrence continued to be monitored at 29 months postsurgery. CONCLUSIONS Sellar ACs can be effectively treated using endonasal fenestration and obliteration with fat with resultant reversal of presenting symptoms in the majority of patients. This simplified technique of AC cavity obliteration without enlarging communication to the SAS has a low risk of CSF leakage and in most cases appears to effectively disrupt cyst progression although longer follow-up is required to monitor for cyst recurrence.",

In this retrospective longitudinal study 12007-12022 five dogs with a median age of 2.8 years received post-operative 3D conformal conventional fractionated radiotherapy CFRT with 2-4 fields parallel-opposed with or without two hinge-angle fields for an incompletely resected nephroblastoma. Clinical findings prior to surgery included one or more of the following pelvic limb paresis 5 faecal incontinence 2 flaccid tail 1 non-ambulatory 2 and deep pain loss 1. All masses were located between T11 and L3 and surgically removed via hemilaminectomy. Dogs received 45-50 Gray Gy in 18-20 fractions and no dogs received chemotherapy post-radiation. At analysis all dogs were deceased with none lost to follow-up. The median overall survival OS from first treatment to death of any cause was 3.4 years 1234 days 95 CI 68 days-upper limit not reached range 68-3607 days.

    "abstract": "Despite its occurrence in most vertebrate species the function of the hypophysial pars tuberalis PT remains obscure. Recent immunocytochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of hormone-containing cells in the few species studied. In the present study the secretory cell composition of the PT was characterized in a variety of mammals using immunocytochemistry. Species studies were the mouse rat guinea pig rabbit sheep rhesus monkey baboon and human. Antisera were chosen on the basis of their ability to identify a distinct cell population in the pars distalis. A total of 21 antisera were used to identify GH PRL ACTH beta-endorphin LH FSH and TSH. Gonadotropes were identified in the PT of all eight species and were the predominant immunoreactive cell type in the human baboon rhesus monkey sheep guinea pig rabbit and mouse. Thyrotropes were detected in all species except the sheep. They were the predominant cell type in the rat but were less common than gonadotropes in other species. No other secretory cell types were found with the exception of occasional somatotropes and mammotropes in some human specimens and small clusters of opiocorticotropes in the guinea pig. Thus the general pattern in the mammalian PT is the presence of gonadotropes and thyrotropes and the absence of other pituitary cell types. In the human baboon and rat all PT parenchymal cells can be identified immunocytochemically. However in the rhesus monkey sheep guinea pig rabbit and mouse the majority of PT cells do not react with any antisera and thus their function is unknown. Follicles are common in the PT of most mammalian species however the luminal contents do not react with antisera to adenohypophysial hormones.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recent clinical trials in adults and children have shown that uncomplicated acute appendicitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics alone. As treatment strategies for acute appendicitis diverge accurate preoperative diagnosis of complicated appendicitis and appendiceal perforation has become increasingly important for clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVE To examine diagnostic performance of ultrasound for detecting perforated appendicitis in a single institution using a standardized technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective single-center study we evaluated 113 ultrasounds from pediatric patients who underwent appendectomy between November 2014 and December 2015. All ultrasounds were performed using a standardized US protocol including still and cine images of all four abdominal quadrants with more targeted evaluation of the right lower quadrant RLQ using graded compression technique. We compared US findings to intraoperative diagnosis of non-perforated or perforated acute appendicitis. RESULTS The standardized image protocol generated a reproducible set of ultrasound images in all cases. The most common primary appendiceal finding on US in perforated appendicitis was appendix wall thickening 3 mm 54 171314 and most common secondary finding was echogenic mesenteric fat 75 237314. Thinning of the appendix wall and loculated fluid collection in the right lower quadrant were both highly specific 90 for perforation. CONCLUSION The diagnostic performance of ultrasound using a standardized US technique was similar to that reported in prior studies for detecting perforated appendicitis. Despite low sensitivity individual ultrasound findings and overall diagnostic impression of evidence of appendix perforation remain highly specific.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Twenty-five dogs 15 dogs in imaging subgroup with IHPSS. METHODS Clinical signs hematologic and biochemical parameters were recorded before and 3 months after PTCE. All dogs received the same medical treatment and underwent PTCE. In the imaging subgroup ultrasonography hepatic portal scintigraphy and computed tomography-angiography were performed pre-PTCE and post-PTCE. RESULTS All evaluated bloodwork values improved by at least 50 of their initial value by 3 months post-PTCE. Liver volume increased after PTCE P .001 but remained lower than normal in 1115 dogs. Hepatic arterial fraction decreased after PTCE P .029 consistent with increased portal blood flow to the liver. Twenty-four of 25 dogs were available for reevaluation at 3 months and all abnormal clinical signs had resolved in 2224 dogs. CONCLUSION PTCE appears promising as a treatment for IHPSS as clinical signs resolved in most cases bloodwork abnormalities often normalized and the procedure was performed safely with minimal complications. PTCE increased hepatic portal perfusion and liver volume in most dogs. These promising results justify a future randomized clinical trial comparing PTCE other attenuation options and medical management alone.",

To address this gap the authors examined the reliability of BP taken at primary care visits and recorded in an EMR with those taken at a research study visit at which standard protocols were used to measure BP among all adults as well as by sex and age. Systolic BP SBP averaged 3.7 17.3 points and diastolic BP DBP was 2.8 10.6 points lower in the EMR than in the study visit across age and sex groups with all differences statistically significant. For this cohort of patients with a diagnosis of hypertension there was moderate correlation between BP measurements taken in clinic and at research. However BP control for individuals as defined by an SBP 140 mm Hg and DBP 90 mm Hg differed by almost 25. Known variability of BP and clinic procedures for measuring and recording BP may account for these differences.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Injury to the renal artery is a rare but serious concern in patients suffering blunt trauma. Complications of renovascular injury include prolonged hospitalization kidney loss and death. There remains considerable controversy regarding the optimal treatment of blunt renal artery injury. METHODS We describe the management of a 39-year-old woman following blunt polytrauma who underwent a multidisciplinary collaborative procedure with open splenectomy and endovascular repair of an occluded renal artery. A literature review of the past 25 years follows including all publications describing endovascular treatment for blunt renal artery injury. RESULTS The literature search identified 27 patients with blunt renal artery injury treated by endovascular means. All patients were treated with angioplasty and stenting none were treated with angioplasty alone. One patient 4 required nephrectomy for hypertension and 89 of patients were reported to be in good condition at their last contact with the healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS The optimal treatment of blunt injury to the renal artery is unknown but endovascular therapy is a feasible and reasonable choice. Further study is warranted to delineate the appropriate role for endovascular treatment as a component of a multidisciplinary approach to the care of trauma patients with blunt renal artery injury.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of resuscitative emergency room thoracotomy ERT particularly in blunt injury has been questioned. Wide application of the procedure may not be cost effective. The risk of exposure and lethal infection to medical personnel during ERT is considerable. For the past decade the policy at this institution has been to perform ERT on all moribund patients sustaining penetrating torso injury and all patients sustaining blunt injury with any evidence of cardiac electrical activity. To evaluate whether such a liberal policy is currently justified the charts of all patients undergoing ERT over a 4-year period were reviewed. One hundred twelve patients underwent ERT 24 21 sustained penetrating injury 88 79 blunt injury. The overall survival rate was 1.8. Penetrating injury had a 4.2 survival and blunt injury 1.1. No patients with CPR initiated at the scene and required throughout transport survived. In those patients with both blood pressure and spontaneous respirations present in the field survival rate was 11.8. Survival rate in patients manifesting sinus rhythm or ventricular fibrillation upon arrival at the ER was 6.4. No survivors were noted among patients coming to the hospital with an idioventricular rhythm or asystole. The total hospital charges for patients undergoing ERT exceeded reimbursement by 59565. Screening for HIV and hepatitis could be documented in only two patients both were negative. Liberal performance of ERT has dismal results incurs monetary loss and affords a greater potential for exposure to lethal infection. Emergency room thoracotomy is justified only when vital signs or a resuscitatible cardiac rhythm are present in the field or ER and deteriorate shortly before thoracotomy.ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS",

    "abstract": "Orthologous regions in barley rice sorghum and wheat were studied by bacterial artificial chromosome sequence analysis. General microcolinearity was observed for the four shared genes in this region. However three genic rearrangements were observed. First the rice region contains a cluster of 48 predicted small nucleolar RNA genes but the comparable region from sorghum contains no homologous loci. Second gene 2 was inverted in the barley lineage by an apparent unequal recombination after the ancestors of barley and wheat diverged 11-15 million years ago mya. Third gene 4 underwent direct tandem duplication in a common ancestor of barley and wheat 29-41 mya. All four of the shared genes show the same synonymous substitution rate but nonsynonymous substitution rates show significant variations between genes 4a and 4b suggesting that gene 4b was largely released from the strong purifying selection that acts on gene 4a in both barley and wheat. Intergenic retrotransposon blocks many of them organized as nested insertions mostly account for the lower gene density of the barley and wheat regions. All but two of the retrotransposons were found in the regions between genes while all but 2 of the 51 inverted repeat transposable elements were found as insertions in genic regions and outside the retrotransposon blocks.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Age has been shown to be a primary determinant of survival following isolated traumatic brain injury TBI. We have previously reported that patients or 65 years who survived mild TBI have decreased functional outcome at 6 months compared with younger patients. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the effect of age on outcome at 1 year in all patients surviving isolated TBI. METHODS The Western Trauma Association multicenter prospective study included all patients sustaining isolated TBI defined as Abbreviated Injury Scale score for Head or 3 with an Abbreviated Injury Scale score in any other body area or 1. Outcome data included discharge disposition Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1 dead to 5 full recovery and modified Functional Independence Measure FIM score measuring feeding expression and locomotion 1 total dependence to 4 total independence for each component at discharge and 1 year. RESULTS In all 295 patients were enrolled with a follow-up of 82 resulting in 241 study patients. An additional five patients died from non-TBI causes and were excluded. The mean and median times for the last follow-up in the 236 remaining patients were 307 and 357 days respectively. Patients were divided into four age ranges 18 to 29 years n 66 30 to 44 years n 54 45 to 59 years n 50 and or 60 years n 65. More severe TBIs as measured by admitting Glasgow Coma Scale GCS were observed in the youngest group compared with all others but there were no differences in mean GCS between the remaining three groups. There were no differences in neurosurgical intervention between the groups. Age was a major determinant in the outcome at discharge and last follow-up. Patients over 60 years discharged with a GOS or 4 were less likely to improve at 1 year than all other groups 37 versus 63 to 85 p or 0.05. Patients between 18 and 29 years of age had the lowest mean Glasgow Outcome Scale and discharge FIM scores which correlated with the low admission GCS. Despite the increased severity of TBI this group had the best FIM score at 1 year. In contrast patients older than 60 years had the least improvement and had a significantly lower final FIM score at 1 year compared with all other groups. CONCLUSION Older patients following isolated TBI have poorer functional status at discharge and make less improvement at 1 year compared with all other patients. These worse outcomes occur despite what appears to be less severe TBI as measured by a higher GCS upon admission. Differences in outcome begin to appear even in patients between 45 and 59 years. Further investigations with more detailed outcome instruments are required to better understand the qualitative limitations of a patients recovery and to devise strategies to maximize functional improvement following TBI. Age is an exceedingly important parameter affecting recovery from isolated TBI.",

    "abstract": "Theories of attention hypothesize the existence of an attentional template that contains target features in working or long-term memory. It is often assumed that the template contents are veridical but recent studies have found that this is not true when the distractor set is linearly separable from the target e.g. all distractors are yellower than an orange-colored target. In such cases the target representation in memory shifts away from distractor features Navalpakkam Itti 2007 and develops a sharper boundary with distractors Geng DiQuattro Helm 2017. These changes in the target template are presumed to increase the target-to-distractor psychological distinctiveness and lead to better attentional selection but it remains unclear what characteristics of the distractor context produce shifting versus sharpening. Here we tested the hypothesis that the template representation shifts whenever the distractor set i.e. all of the distractors is linearly separable from the target but asymmetrical sharpening occurs only when linearly separable distractors are highly target-similar. Our results were consistent suggesting that template shifting and asymmetrical sharpening are 2 mechanisms that increase the representational distinctiveness of targets from expected distractors and improve visual search performance.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To describe using spectral domain optical coherence tomography SD-OCT digital slit-lamp biomicroscopy and external photography changes in the ophidian cuticle spectacle and cornea during ecdysis. ANIMALS STUDIED Four normal royal pythons Python regius. PROCEDURES Snakes were assessed once daily throughout a complete shed cycle using nasal axial and temporal SD-OCT images digital slit-lamp biomicroscopy and external photography. RESULTS Spectral domain optical coherence tomography SD-OCT images reliably showed the spectacular cuticle and stroma subcuticular space SCS cornea anterior chamber iris and Schlemms canal. When visible the subspectacular space SSS was more distended peripherally than axially. Ocular surface changes throughout ecdysis were relatively conserved among snakes at all three regions imaged. From baseline 7 days following completion of a full cycle the spectacle gradually thickened before separating into superficial cuticular and deep hyper-reflective stromal components thereby creating the SCS. During spectacular separation the stroma regained original reflectivity and multiple hyper-reflective foci likely fragments from the cuticular-stromal interface were noted within the SCS. The cornea was relatively unchanged in character or thickness throughout all stages of ecdysis. Slit-lamp images did not permit observation of these changes. CONCLUSIONS Spectral domain optical coherence tomography SD-OCT provided excellent high-resolution images of the snake anterior segment and especially the cuticle spectacle and cornea of manually restrained normal snakes at all stages of ecdysis and warrants investigation in snakes with anterior segment disease. The peripheral spectacle may be the preferred entry point for diagnostic or therapeutic injections into the SSS and for initiating spectacular surgery.",

    "abstract": "The prosocial hormone oxytocin OXT has become a new target for research on the etiology and treatment of autism spectrum disorder ASD a condition characterized by deficits in social function. However it remains unknown whether there are alterations in OXT receptor OXTR levels in the ASD brain. This study quantified the density of OXTR and of the structurally related vasopressin 1a receptor AVPR1a in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with ASD and typically developing individuals. We analyzed two regions known to contain OXTR across all primates studied to date the nucleus basalis of Meynert NBM which mediates visual attention and the superior colliculus which controls gaze direction. In the NBM specimens we also analyzed the neighboring ventral pallidum VP and the external segment of the globus pallidus. In the superior colliculus specimens we also analyzed the adjacent periaqueductal gray. We detected dense OXTR binding in the human NBM and VP and moderate to low OXTR binding in the human globus pallidus superior colliculus and periaqueductal gray. AVPR1a binding was negligible across all five regions in all specimens. Compared to controls ASD specimens exhibited significantly higher OXTR binding in the NBM and significantly lower OXTR binding in the VP an area in the mesolimbic reward pathway. There was no effect of ASD on OXTR binding in the globus pallidus superior colliculus or periaqueductal gray. We also found a significant negative correlation between age and OXTR binding in the VP across all specimens. Further analysis revealed a peak in OXTR binding in the VP in early childhood of typically developing individuals which was absent in ASD. This pattern suggests a possible early life critical period which is lacking in ASD where this important reward area becomes maximally sensitive to OXT binding. These results provide unique neurobiological insight into human social development and the social symptoms of ASD.",

This retrospective study reviews the clinical signs radiographic findings and outcome after surgical resection of SACs in 14 dogs. Plain vertebral column radiographs and myelography were done in all dogs. Computed tomography CT was done in 7 dogs and magnetic resonance MR imaging in 3 dogs. Affected dogs were between 1 and 12 years of age and 8 of 14 were Rottweilers. Abnormalities detected on neurological examination depended on the location of the SAC. Five dogs had bilobed or multiple SACs. SACs were located in the cervical vertebral column in 11 dogs and in the thoracic vertebral column in 4 dogs. All dogs had dorsally or dorsolaterally located SACs. Two dogs also had additional ventrally located SACs. Spinal cord compression secondary to intervertebral disc extrusion or protrusion was demonstrated at the site of the SACs in 2 dogs. Surgical resection of the SACs was completed in all dogs. Eleven dogs were available for follow-up. Five weeks postoperatively 7 dogs improved in neurological function with some residual ataxia and paresis in 6 of these dogs. Neurological function had deteriorated in 4 dogs. It was concluded from this study that Rottweilers have a higher incidence of SACs than other breeds of dog. Furthermore bilobed or multiple SACs can occur commonly and myelography effectively localized SACs in dogs. Surgical resection of SACs resulted in improvement in neurological function in the majority of treated dogs.",

We characterized the virulence profiles of K. pneumoniae isolates from necropsied SSOs evaluated killing of marine mammal K. pneumoniae following in vitro exposure to California sea lion CSL Zalophanus californianus whole blood and serum and characterized lesion patterns associated with Klebsiella spp. infection in SSOs. Four of 15 SSO K. pneumoniae isolates were HMV and all were recovered from SSOs that stranded during 2005. Many K. pneumoniae infections were associated with moderate to severe pathology as a cause of death or sequela.

    "abstract": "We studied seven programs that engage youth from 10 to 18 years old in wildfire risk reduction in their communities in the United States through in-depth interviews to examine the nature and role of community-school partnerships in resource-focused environmental education. While the programs use a variety of strategies from Scout badge to summer school they exhibit several common dimensions they all engage youth in community projects they all arise from partnerships between resource agencies community organizations and educators they all began when people familiar with both wildfire and youth education saw an opportunity to improve the community and educate youth through action and all partners are able to contribute to the common program yet retain their individual identity as they meet their own mission-based goals. We use themes and quotes to illustrate these common dimensions for establishing community-school partnerships that could build action competence through environment-based education projects.",

We review all investigations published in English that met specific methodological standards including the use of comparison samples coding blind to group membership and adequate levels of interrater reliability. After discussing in detail the pros and cons of the home-movie methodology we review the results of all empirical studies conducted to date. We then present a summary of the features found consistently across studies that differentiate autism from typical development and mental retardation in the first 2 years of life. How family home movies can contribute to our understanding of the regression phenomenon is also addressed. Finally the results are interpreted from both a theoretical and clinical point of view.",

When the universe is created near the Planck scale all the available states in the theory are excited by strong interactions and cosmological particle production. The heavy states are described in the low energy theory as a gas of electrically and magnetically charged black holes. This gas of black holes quickly captures the moduli which appear in the relation between black hole masses and charges and slows them down with their vevs typically close to the Planck scale. From there the modulus may slowly roll into a valley with a positive vacuum energy where inflation may begin. The black hole gas will redshift away in the course of cosmic expansion as inflation evicts the black holes out of the horizon. 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Utility All-Terrain Vehicles ATVs are commonly used on farms for agricultural activities such as carrying implements applying fertilizers and transportation. Among all agricultural ATV incidents on farms rollover crushes are the leading cause of fatalities. Crush Protection Devices CPDs are passive safety structures that potentially decrease the severity of injuries and the number of deaths in agricultural ATV rollover incidents. However there are contradictions in the results of previous studies regarding the effectiveness of CPDs in protecting the operator in rollover incidents. The effectiveness of CPDs should be evaluated experimentally with an autonomous ATV allowing repeatable and systematic rollover tests. This study aims at developing three automatic control systems on an ATV for future rollover simulations 1 Global Positioning System GPS- based navigation system that allows autonomous steering 2 remote cruise control module for keeping consistent riding speeds and 3 remote braking system for safety in future unmanned ATV tests.The performance of each system was examined by operating the autonomous ATV in an outdoor testing terrain. The term autonomy in this study refers to the autonomous steering system along with the remotely controlled speed and braking systems. Results showed that the developed systems performed within the acceptable range for conducting future rollover tests accurately and safely. Application of the autonomous ATV expects to deliver repeatable results in rollover simulations and thus increases the reliability of CPD evaluation.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Risk adjustment is an important component of quality assessment in surgical health care. However data collection places an additional burden on physicians. There is also concern that outcomes can be gamed depending on the information recorded for each patient. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a number of machine-collected data elements could perform as well as a traditional full-risk adjustment model that includes other physician-assessed and physician-recorded data elements. DESIGN SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS All general surgery patients from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from January 1 2005 to December 31 2010 were included. Separate multivariate logistic regressions were performed using either all 66 preoperative risk variables or only 25 objective variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC of each regression using objective preoperative risk variables was compared with its corresponding regression with all preoperative variables. Subset analyses were performed among patients who received certain operations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality or any surgical complication captured by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program both inpatient and within 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS Data from a total of 745 053 patients were included. More than 15.8 of patients had at least 1 complication and the mortality rate was 2.8. When examining inpatient mortality the AUC was 0.9104 with all 66 variables vs 0.8918 with all 25 objective variables. The difference in AUC comparing models with all variables with objective variables ranged from -0.0073 to 0.1944 for mortality and 0.0198 to 0.0687 for complications. In models predicting mortality the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair pancreatic resection colectomy and appendectomy. In models predicting complications the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with pancreatic resection laparoscopic cholecystectomy colectomy and appendectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rigorous risk-adjusted surgical quality assessment can be performed solely with objective variables. By leveraging data already routinely collected for patient care this approach allows for wider adoption of quality assessment systems in health care. Identifying data elements that can be automatically collected can make future improvements to surgical outcomes and quality analyses.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether battery longevity is comparable for CRT-ICDs from different manufacturers in a contemporary cohort of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS All the CRT-ICDs implanted at our institution from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010 were included in this analysis. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected on all patients using the electronic medical record. Detailed device information was collected on all patients from scanned device printouts obtained during routine follow-up. The primary endpoint was device replacement for battery reaching the elective replacement indicator ERI. A total of 646 patients age 69 13 years implanted with CRT-ICDs Boston Scientific 173 Medtronic 416 and St Jude Medical 57 were included in this analysis. During 2.7 1.5 years follow-up 113 17 devices had reached ERI Boston scientific 4 Medtronic 25 and St Jude Medical 7 P 0.001. The 4-year survival rate of device battery was significantly worse for Medtronic devices compared with devices from other manufacturers 94 for Boston scientific 67 for Medtronic and 92 for St Jude Medical P 0.001. The difference in battery longevity by manufacturer was independent of pacing burden lead parameters and burden of ICD therapy. CONCLUSION There are significant discrepancies in CRT-ICD battery longevity by manufacturer. These data have important implications on clinical practice and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Integrated health care delivery systems with their comprehensive and integrated electronic medical records EMR are well-poised to conduct research that leverages the detailed clinical data within the EMRs. However information regarding the representativeness of these clinical populations is limited and thus the generalizability of research findings is uncertain. METHODS Using data from the population-based California Cancer Registry we compared age-adjusted distributions of patient and neighborhood characteristics for three groups of breast cancer patients 1 those diagnosed within Kaiser Permanente Northern California KPNC 2 non-KPNC patients from NCI-designated cancer centers and 3 those from all other hospitals. RESULTS KPNC patients represented 32 N 36109 cancer center patients represented 7 N 7805 and all other hospitals represented 61 N 68330 of the total breast cancer patients from this geographic area during 1996-2009. Compared with cases from all other hospitals KPNC had slightly fewer non-Hispanic Whites 70.6 versus 74.4 but more Blacks 8.1 versus 5.0 slightly more patients in the 50-69 age range and fewer in the younger and older age groups a slightly lower proportion of in situ but higher proportion of stage I disease 41.6 versus 38.9 were slightly less likely to reside in the lowest 4.2 versus 6.5 and highest 36.2 versus 39.0 socioeconomic status neighborhoods and more likely to live in suburban metropolitan areas and neighborhoods with more racialethnic minorities. Cancer center patients differed substantially from patients from KPNC and all other hospitals on all characteristics assessed. All differences were statistically significant p .001. CONCLUSIONS Although much of clinical research discoveries are based in academic medical centers patients from large integrated medical centers are likely more representative of the underlying population providing support for the generalizability of cancer research based on electronic data from these centers.",

    "abstract": "A total of 66 transgenic rice cell lines were produced by simultaneously transforming rice callus with nine different plasmidsgenes. PCR analysis indicated that the co-transformation frequency of each gene was about 70. All the cell lines carried at least three genes and 11 cell lines carried all nine genes. Thirty-two fertile transgenic plants R0 were generated from the transgenic cell lines and seeds of 32 transgenic R1 lines and 5 R2 lines were harvested and analyzed for gene inheritance and protein expression. Progeny segregation analysis indicated that the multiple transgenes were integrated into the same locus of the rice genome resulting in a 31 segregation ratio of the transgenes. Expression analysis of all nine transgenes revealed that the transgenes were expressed in all generations R0 R1 and R2 and about half of the transgenes from each line were expressed. The expression of one transgene appears to have no effect on the expression of another transgene. Among the 66 cell lines six lines 9.1 expressed seven or eight transgenes out of the nine transformed genes. All together our results showed that multiple genes could be delivered into rice cells simultaneously and cell lines expressing multiple genes could be generated. The results and procedures reported here should be useful in designing multi-plasmid transformation experiments such as those required for plant metabolic engineering.",

In the context of this discussion a novel hetero-nanostructure array based on quantum-confined and visible light-active ironIII oxide nanostructures and their surface modification with tungstenVI oxide is introduced. The heterostructure architecture is designed to combine the functionality of the consituent phases to address the primary requirements for electrodes enabling the efficient generation of hydrogen using solar energy visible light activity chemical stability appropriate bandedge characteristics and potential for low-cost fabrication.

Such comparisons however are potentially confounded by two key effects different brew temperatures necessarily change the extraction dynamics and potentially alter the resulting brew strength and different consumption temperatures are well known to affect perceived flavor and taste. Here we performed a systematic study of how extraction temperature affects the sensory qualities of full immersion coffee. The investigation used a 3 3 3 factorial design with coffee from three different origins representing different post-harvest methods washed honey-processed and wet-hulled each roasted to three different levels light medium and dark and each brewed at three different temperatures 4 C 22 C and 92 C. All coffees were brewed to equilibrium then diluted to precisely 2 total dissolved solids TDS and served at the same cold temperature 4 C. We find that four attributes exhibited statistically significant variations with brew temperature for all origins and roast levels tested with bitter taste sour taste and rubber flavor all higher in hot brewed coffees and floral flavor higher in cold brewed coffee. However there were strong interactions with origin and roast with several additional attributes significantly impacted by temperature for specific origins and roast levels.

Following a previously described UEMA protocol 55 children with BPBP and 51 normal children control group were studied. Kinematic data of selected ADLs were collected before surgery. UEMA was used to measure statistically significant differences between children with BPBP and control subjects for all planes of shoulder motion in all activities tested. The authors conclude that UEMA can discriminate between children with BPBP and control subjects during selected ADLs and suggest that UEMA can also be used to measure the effects of surgical interventions in children with BPBP.",

    "abstract": "In recent years the use of non-invasive host and environmental samples for the detection and monitoring of equine respiratory pathogens has shown promise and a high overall agreement with the gold standard of nasal secretions. The present study looked at comparing nose wipes stall sponges and air samples with nasal swabs collected from 27 horses involved in an equine influenza EI outbreak. The outbreak involved 5 clinical 6 subclinical and 16 uninfected horses. Samples sets were collected at the onset of the index case and retested every 2-3 days thereafter until all horses tested qPCR-negative for EI virus EIV. Nose wipes and stall sponges identified EIV in all clinical cases and air samples identified EIV in 45 clinical horses. The overall agreement with all nasal swabs collected from clinical cases was 89 for nose wipes 78 for stall sponges and 44 for air samples. Due to the shorter shedding time in subclinical cases nose wipes and stall sponges detected EIV in 56 and 46 subclinical horses respectively. Only one single air sample tested qPCR-positive for EIV in a subclinical shedder. When compared to the gold standard of nasal secretions in subclinically infected horses the overall agreement was 54 for stall sponges 50 for air samples and 45 for nose wipes. The collection of non-invasive contact and environmental samples is a promising alternative to nasal swabs for the detection of EIV in clinically and subclinically infected horses. However they should always be considered as a second-choice sample type to the more accurate nasal swabs and used to test refractory horses or large populations during outbreaks. Further the pooling of identical or different samples collected from the same horse for the qPCR testing of EIV increases the accuracy of detecting EIV especially in subclinically infected horses.",

    "abstract": "Identification of differentially expressed DE genes across two conditions is a common task with microarray. Most existing approaches accomplish this goal by examining each gene separately based on a model and then control the false discovery rate over all genes. We took a different approach that employs a uniform platform to simultaneously depict the dynamics of the gene trajectories for all genes and select differently expressed genes. A new Functional Principal Component FPC approach is developed for time-course microarray data to borrow strength across genes. The approach is flexible as the temporal trajectory of the gene expressions is modeled nonparametrically through a set of orthogonal basis functions and often fewer basis functions are needed to capture the shape of the gene expression trajectory than existing nonparametric methods. These basis functions are estimated from the data reflecting major modes of variation in the data. The correlation structure of the gene expressions over time is also incorporated without any parametric assumptions and estimated from all genes such that the information across other genes can be shared to infer one individual gene. Estimation of the parameters is carried out by an efficient hybrid EM algorithm. The performance of the proposed method across different scenarios was compared favorably in simulation to two-way mixed-effects ANOVA and the EDGE method using B-spline basis function. Application to the real data on C. elegans developmental stages also suggested that FPC analysis combined with hybrid EM algorithm provides a computationally fast and efficient method for identifying DE genes based on time-course microarray data. 2010 The Authors.",

Study of 162 individuals identified 134 HLA class I alleles 41 HLA-A 60 HLA-B and 33 HLA-C. Common to all populations are three HLA-C alleles C1C0701 C1C0702 and C2C0602 but no HLA-A or -B Unexpectedly no novel HLA class I was identified in these previously unstudied and anthropologically distinctive populations. In contrast of 227 KIR detected 22 are present in all seven populations and 28 are novel. A high diversity of HLA A-C-B haplotypes was observed. In six populations most haplotypes are represented just once. But in the Hadza a majority of haplotypes occur more than once with 2 having high frequencies and 10 having intermediate frequencies. The centromeric cen part of the KIR locus exhibits an even balance between cenA and cenB in all seven populations. The telomeric tel part has an even balance of telA to telB in East Africa but this changes across the continent to where telB is vestigial in West Africa. All four KIR ligands A311 Bw4 C1 and C2 are present in six of the populations. HLA haplotypes of the Iraqw and Hadza encode two KIR ligands whereas the other populations have an even balance between haplotypes encoding one and two KIR ligands. Individuals in these African populations have a mean of 6.8-8.4 different interactions between KIR and HLA class I compared with 2.9-6.5 for non-Africans.",

    "abstract": "Crush Protection Device CPD could potentially decrease the severity of injuries and the number of fatalities in agricultural All-Terrain Vehicle ATV rollover crushes. CPD is a passive safety structure that protects the operator in ATV rollover incidents. The effectiveness of CPDs should be evaluated experimentally with an autonomous ATV in order to conduct repeatable and accurate rollover tests. The long-term goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of CPD in experimental ATV rollover accidents using an autonomous ATV which includes speed brake and steering control systems. This study aims to implement a Global Positioning System GPS based navigation that allows an autonomous ATV to follow a virtual path in the field. The system was designed and installed on a 4x4 Honda FourTrax Rancher ATV that is equipped with an electric power steering EPS. The autonomous steering system requires three major components 1 an accurate positioning system 2 a high-level controller equipped with the path-following feature and 3 a low-level controller that provides physical steering of the ATV handlebar. The position data was obtained by a Real-Time Kinematic RTK Global Navigation Satellite System GNSS system. The high-level controller was built based on the estimation algorithm Extended Kalman Filter EKF which allows centimeter accuracy in position. The proportional integral derivative PID controller with feedback was utilized in the low-level servo controller to precisely turn the EPS motor on the ATVs steering shaft. The performance of the GPS-based steering system was examined by calculating the position error of the autonomous ATV operating on a virtual path. By applying an accurate steering control system repeatable rollover simulations are expected in future field tests.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Blood typing before transfusion minimizes the risk of transfusion reactions and prevents immunization of the recipient against incompatible RBC antigens. The major RBC antigens that warrant identification before packed RBC or whole blood transfusions in horses are Ca and Aa. Standard blood-typing protocols are time-consuming 2.5-3.0 hours and impractical in emergency settings. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine whether equine RBCs could be typed for Ca and Aa antigens using sera from horses with RBC antibodies in a modified rapid 15 minute blood-typing protocol. METHODS Serum was obtained from a horse with anti-Ca antibodies and from another horse with anti-Aa antibodies. The presence of agglutinating antibodies was confirmed with antibody screening. Venous blood samples collected in citrate-phosphate-dextrose were obtained from 21 horses of various breeds. Samples were blood typed in the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital Hematology Laboratory using standard methodology. Washed RBCs from each of the 21 horses were incubated individually with anti-Ca and anti-Aa sera at dilutions of 14 18 and 116 for 15 and 30 minutes at room temperature and 37 degrees C. RESULTS Of the 21 horses 13 were identified as AaCa four were AaCa- two were Aa-Ca and two were Aa-Ca-. All 17 Aa-positive horses had a positive agglutination reaction at all dilutions of anti-Aa serum incubation times and temperatures while all Aa-negative horses were negative. Each Ca-positive horse had a positive agglutination reaction at all incubation time points and temperatures up to the 116 dilution of the anti-Ca serum. All Ca-negative horses were negative at all times temperatures and dilutions of anti-Ca serum. Use of the modified protocol on 26 hospitalized horses resulted in accurate typing based on complete antibody screens. CONCLUSIONS These results support the hypothesis that equine RBCs can be blood typed using a rapid 15 minute protocol at room temperature for the presence of Ca and Aa antigens using equine-derived antisera. This technique may be beneficial for pretransfusion testing of equine patients in an emergency setting.",

To determine gaps in and opportunities for recruitment of women and minority groups in the pipeline for I-6 residency we quantified rates of progression at each training level and trends over time. METHODS We obtained 2015 to 2019 medical student I-6 applicant and I-6 resident gender and raceethnicity demographic data from the American Association of Medical Colleges and Electronic Residency Application Service public databases and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Books. We performed 2 Fisher exact and Cochran-Armitage tests for trend to compare 2015 and 2019. RESULTS Our cross-sectional analysis found increased representation of women and all non-White racesethnicities except Native American at each training level from 2015 to 2019 P .001 for all. The greatest trends in increases were seen in the proportions of women 28 vs 22 P .46 and AsianPacific Islander 25 vs 15 P .08 applicants. There was also an increase in the proportions of women 28 vs 24 P .024 and White 61 vs 58 P .007 I-6 residents with a trend for AsianPacific Islanders 20 vs 17 P .08. The proportions of Hispanic 5 and BlackAfrican American 2 I-6 residents in 2019 remained low. CONCLUSIONS I-6 residency matriculation is not representative of medical student demographics and spotlights a need to foster early interest in cardiothoracic surgery among all groups underrepresented in medicine while ensuring that we mitigate bias in residency recruitment.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 infection is still a mystery in terms of its long-term effect on health and its consequences on hematological disorders. Prior studies including ours have shown the abnormal changes in hematopoietic cells in COVID-19 patients. In this article we are presenting 2 cases of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL with a previous history of COVID-19 infection. The first case describes a 22-month-old boy presenting with lymphadenopathy neutropenia and anemia with concurrent COVID-19 infection without any evidence of a hematolymphoid neoplasm as per bone marrow and lymph node biopsy. However he presented after 2 months with bone marrow biopsy confirming B-ALL. The second case is that of a 4-year-old girl presenting with B-ALL who has had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection 5 months before this current presentation. Both the cases had complete resolution of COVID-19 infection during the time of presentation with acute leukemia. There were notably 2 rare findings along the course of the patients illnesses. First the unusual plasmacytosis in the marrow during active COVID-19 infection in the first patient and the second is predilection of development of B-ALL following COVID-19. In both the cases the fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH studies showed pathologic alteration of the RUNX1 gene. Overall there are no literature to support a causal association between acute B-ALL and COVID-19. The diagnosis of B-ALL in these patients after COVID-19 infection may be totally unrelated. However if we consider Greaves proposed 2-hit model for childhood acute leukemia that an infectious agent can precipitate development of B-ALL in a genetically susceptible individual. Alteration of the RUNX1 gene in both the patients opens a door for further exploration of the second-hit hypothesis regarding an infectious agent precipitating development of B-ALL in a genetically susceptible individual.",

This technique is particularly useful for the generation of large libraries of randomly mutagenized genes which are required for the optimization of enzymes by directed evolution. We subjected the gene coding for the protease subtilisin to six consecutive rounds of PCR at three different levels of mutagenicity. The resulting 18 populations were cloned using our PCR multimerization protocol and the mutation frequencies were determined by DNA sequencing. The resulting data demonstrate that the mutation frequency during PCR can be controlled by adding varying concentrations of manganese chloride to the reaction mixture. We observed a bias in the type of base pair changes with A and T being mutated much more frequently than C and G. We determined the fraction of active clones in all populations and found that its natural logarithm is proportional to the average mutation frequency of the populations. These data reveal that a fraction of about 0.27 of all possible mutations leads to the inactivation of the subtilisin gene which provides a measure for its structural plasticity.",

LC analysis is compared with the potential of gas chromatography and its advantages are discussed. Solid-phase extraction appeared not to be a suitable for all compounds. The method allows the determination of benzothiazole derivatives without further clean-up down to contents of about 5 g l-1 with recovery rates exceeding 90 for all compounds. Dissolved organic carbon contents of up to 900 mg l-1 did neither interfere with extraction nor with chromatographic separation. 1994.",

    "abstract": "The atypoid mygalomorphs include spiders from three described families that build a diverse array of entrance web constructs including funnel-and-sheet webs purse webs trapdoors turrets and silken collars. Molecular phylogenetic analyses have generally supported the monophyly of Atypoidea but prior studies have not sampled all relevant taxa. Here we generated a dataset of ultraconserved element loci for all described atypoid genera including taxa Mecicobothrium and Hexurella key to understanding familial monophyly divergence times and patterns of entrance web evolution. We show that the conserved regions of the arachnid UCE probe set target exons such that it should be possible to combine UCE and transcriptome datasets in arachnids. We also show that different UCE probes sometimes target the same protein and under the matching parameters used here show that UCE alignments sometimes include non-orthologs. Using multiple curated phylogenomic matrices we recover a monophyletic Atypoidea and reveal that the family Mecicobothriidae comprises four separate and divergent lineages. Fossil-calibrated divergence time analyses suggest ancient Triassic or older origins for several relictual atypoid lineages with late Cretaceousearly Tertiary divergences within some genera indicating a high potential for cryptic species diversity. The ancestral entrance web construct for atypoids and all mygalomorphs is reconstructed as a funnel-and-sheet web.",

    "abstract": "In leukemia a distinct subpopulation of cancer-initiating cells called leukemia stem cells LSCs is believed to drive population expansion and tumor growth. Failing to eliminate LSCs may result in disease relapse regardless of the amount of non-LSCs destroyed. The first step in targeting and eliminating LSCs is to identify and characterize them. Acute precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL cells derived from patients were incubated with fluorescent glucose analog 2-N-7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1 3-diazol-4-yl Amino-2-Deoxyglucose NBDG and sorted based on NBDG uptake. Cell subpopulations defined by glucose uptake were then serially transplanted into mice and evaluated for leukemia initiating capacity. Gene expression profiles of these cells were characterized using RNA-Sequencing RNA-Seq. A distinct population of NBDG-low cells was identified in patient B-ALL samples. These cells are a small population 1.92 of the entire leukemia population have lower HLA expression and are smaller in size 4.0 to 7.0 m than the rest of the leukemia population. All mice transplanted with NBDG-low cells developed leukemia between 5 and 14 weeks while those transplanted with NBDG-high cells did not develop leukemia p 0.0001-0.002. Serial transplantation of the NBDG-low mouse model resulted in successful leukemia development. NBDG-medium NBDG-med populations also developed leukemia. Interestingly comprehensive molecular characterization of NBDG-low and NBDG-med cells from patient-derived xenograft PDX models using RNA-Seq revealed a distinct profile of 2162 differentially-expressed transcripts DETs p0.05 with 70.6 down-regulated in NBDG-low cells. Hierarchical clustering of DETs showed distinct segregation of NBDG-low from NBDG-med and NBDG-high groups with marked transcription expression alterations in the NBDG-low group consistent with cancer survival. In conclusion A unique subpopulation of cells with low glucose uptake NBDG-low in B-ALL was discovered. These cells despite their quiescence characteristics once transplanted in mice showed potent leukemia initiating capacity. Although NBDG-med cells also initiated leukemia gene expression profiling revealed a distinct signature that clearly distinguishes NBDG-low cells from NBDG-med and the rest of the leukemia populations. These results suggest that NBDG-low cells may represent quiescent LSCs. These cells can be activated in the appropriate environment in vivo showing leukemia initiating capacity. Our study provides insight into the biologic mechanisms of B-ALL initiation and survival.",

    "abstract": "Trophic cascades mean runaway consumption downward dominance through the food chain with autotrophs being particularly vulnerable. Standing crop and coverage of the plant community are reduced wholesale when one or a few species of potent herbivores are not suppressed. Primary carnivores or diseases by suppressing herbivores switch the substrate from open to well-occupied by plants. In true trophic cascades pervasive top-down influence combines with the always strong bottom-up influence through the food chain to produce acute intertwining between population community and ecosystem processes. True trophic cascades imply keystone species taxa with such top-down dominance that their removal causes precipitous changes in the system. The authors premise is that true cascades in the community sense are a relatively unusual sort of food web mechanics. Over the full range of ecological communites evidence is that these cascades are restricted to fairly low-diversity places where great influence can issue from one or a few species. Most examples of true trophic cascades have algae at the base and are aquatic. The author demonstrates the vulnerability of the turf of some algal ecosystems emphasises that not all algal ecosystems cascade examines reticulate webs in high-diversity systems and considers the architecture depicted in true trophic cascades reminiscent of a ladder with trophic webs. -from Author",

These two systems involve gels which are mixtures composed of a polymer network permeated by water. The fluid mechanics of these systems is essential to their biological function and structure. Their mathematical descriptions must account for the mechanics of the polymer the water and the interaction between these two phases. This review focuses on multiphase flow models because this framework is natural for including the relative motion between the phases the exchange of material between phases and the additional stresses within the network that arise from nonspecific chemical interactions and the action of molecular motors. These models have been successful in accounting for how different forces are generated and transmitted to achieve cell motion and biofilm growth and they have demonstrated how emergent structures develop though the interactions of the two phases. A short description of multiphase flow models of tumor growth is included to highlight the flexibility of the model in describing diverse biological applications.",

Specifically the model updates for all the tasks are transmitted and superimposed concurrently over a non-orthogonal uplink fading channel and the model aggregations of all the tasks are reconstructed at the ES through a modified version of the turbo compressed sensing algorithm Turbo-CS that overcomes inter-task interference. Both convergence analysis and numerical results show that the OA-FMTL framework can significantly improve the system efficiency in terms of reducing the number of channel uses without causing substantial learning performance degradation.",

SAMPLE Medical records from 381 dogs with histologically confirmed oral tumors that underwent preoperative screening were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Thoracic metastasis was diagnosed in 4.9 0.9 odontogenic 6.5 nonodontogenic of oral tumors. Oral malignant melanoma and multilobular osteochondrosarcoma were most at risk. Abdominal metastasis was diagnosed in 2 of oral tumors 0 odontogenic 3.1 nonodontogenic and cytologically confirmed in 2 cases 0.6 2295 of all abdominal ultrasounds AUS 5.5 236 of all AUS that had cytology. Both cases had oral malignant melanoma. Incidental disease was diagnosed in 53.1 and 81.3 of thoracic and abdominal screenings respectively. Major findings were more common in AUS 7.8 compared to thoracic screening 1.9. The prevalence of incidental findings was similar for odontogenic and nonodontogenic tumors. Both metastasis and major findings were diagnosed more commonly with thoracic CT compared to radiographs. Metastasis or a major finding of prognostic significance was diagnosed in at least 1 test in 27.8 of patients that had head CT lymph node cytology thoracic screening and AUS n 115. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Major incidental findings were more commonly detected with AUS and were diagnosed in 1 in every 12 patients. However metastatic disease was most commonly detected with thoracic screening. When all 4 screening tests are performed there is an approximately 1 in 4 chance of diagnosing metastasis or major significant disease regardless of tumor type.",

All were localized at diagnosis head 4 lower extremities 4 trunk 2 with a mean diameter of 4.5 cm. Mean follow-up was 6 years. Six patients were in complete remission 1 after a relapse 2 died of metastatic disease 1 was alive with metastasis. Histologically 8 tumors showed spindle cells with a focal or diffuse storiform pattern 2 tumors had scattered aggregates of epithelioid cells. Two tumors displayed a prominent epithelioid component. Cellular pleomorphism high mitotic rate with atypical mitoses were found in all tumors necrosis in 6 and vascular invasion in 2. CD68 and desmin were positive in 2 cases each smooth muscle actin in 4 and S100 in 1. Five tumors in 1st and 1 in 2nd complete remission were superficial 1 showed a spindle cell morphology with epithelioid foci 3 had necrosis 5 were grade 3 and 1 was grade 2. Three metastatic tumors 2 in the dura 1 in the leg displayed either a prominent epithelioid morphology 2 or scattered aggregates of epithelioid cells 1 with a myxoid background in 1. All were grade 3 and showed foci of necrosis. In summary UHGPS is rare in children and frequently located in the head. A more favorable outcome is associated with superficial location.

We impose steric constraints by assuming that the system is represented on a cubic lattice. We also assume incompressibility i.e. all sites of the lattice are occupied. This model which we refer to as the Hydrophobic Dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann Langevin HDPBL model leads to a system of two equations whose solutions give the water dipole salt and hydrophobic molecule densities all of them in the presence of the others in a self-consistent way. We use those to study the organization of the ions cosolvent and solvent molecules around proteins. In particular peaks of densities are expected to reveal simultaneously the presence of compatible binding sites of different kinds on a protein.

Similar ESAS-r and PDSS scores were shown at all predefined disease time points except following an SRM biopsy and at last follow-up where AS-treated patients with a biopsy-proven malignancy had significantly worse PDSS 11.4 vs. 6.1 P 0.035 and 13.2 vs. 5.4 P 0.004 respectively. At last follow-up multivariable linear models demonstrated that a biopsy-proven malignancy B 2.630 95 CI 0.024-5.236 P 0.048 and AS strategy B 6.499 95 CI 2.340-10.658 P 0.002 were associated with worse PDSS in all patients and in those who underwent a biopsy respectively. CONCLUSIONS Offering standardized psychological supportive care may be required for patients younger than 70 years on AS for SRM especially for those with a biopsy-proven tumor.",

However biological interpretations of metabolic regulation in these datasets are hindered by inherent limits of pathway enrichment statistics. We have developed ChemRICH a statistical enrichment approach that is based on chemical similarity rather than sparse biochemical knowledge annotations. ChemRICH utilizes structure similarity and chemical ontologies to map all known metabolites and name metabolic modules. Unlike pathway mapping this strategy yields study-specific non-overlapping sets of all identified metabolites. Subsequent enrichment statistics is superior to pathway enrichments because ChemRICH sets have a self-contained size where p-values do not rely on the size of a background database. We demonstrate ChemRICHs efficiency on a public metabolomics data set discerning the development of type 1 diabetes in a non-obese diabetic mouse model.

Treatments included water only 31 honey-water solution floral and extra-floral nectars from five different plants excised stems from Fagopyrum esculentum Lobularia maritima Phacelia tanacetifolia Anethum graveolens and Vicia faba honeydew from Coccus hesperidum and Homalodisca vitripennis formally H. coagulata a commercially available food supplement Eliminade and citrus foliage. Additionally the sugar composition of each food resource was determined using HPLC and whole flower extracts. Honey-water and F. esculentum nectar significantly increased longevity of male and female G. ashmeadi G. triguttatus and G. fasciatus up to 1860 1323 and 1459 respectively when compared with water. For both sexes and all three parasitoid species survival on citrus foliage H. vitripennis excrement and P. tanacetifolia flowers was equivalent to that on water only. The longevity of G. ashmeadi and G. triguttatus was up to 539 higher on Eliminade compared with water only however there was no significant effect of Eliminade on survival of G. fasciatus. Coccus hesperidum honeydew increased survival times up to 665 for all mymarid species compared with citrus foliage alone. HPLC analysis indicated that food resources most beneficial to Gonatocerus parasitoids possessed a high proportion of glucose up to 44 and fructose up to 53 suggesting that sucrose may not be as important for parasitoid survival. Citrus and P. tanacetifolia flowers contained favorable proportions of glucose and fructose but the inability of Gonatocerus spp. to benefit from this may be related to flower morphology which could prevent access to nectar. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

To determine the incidence of serious morbidity and mortality associated with falls in this patient population the authors surveyed the 135 patient members of the International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Association and an age and gender matched control group. Eighty-one percent of the fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva population suffered a fall resulting in injury compared with 44 of the controls. Sixty-seven percent of the falls initiated a painful flareup of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva leading to permanent loss of movement in almost all patients. Fifty-four percent of all falls suffered by the fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva group led to permanent disability compared with 4 of all falls in the control group. Although trauma to the head was a common site of injury in both groups the injury profile in the fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva group included traumatic brain injuries intracranial hemorrhage and death whereas the control group suffered mostly minor soft tissue lacerations. Deficiencies in coordinate gait and protective function likely accounted for the severity of injuries especially to the head in the fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva population. Precautions are recommended that are intended to minimize the risk of injury without compromising a patients functional level and independence. These recommendations include limitation of high risk activities protective head gear safety improvements in living environments and augmentation of stabilizing and protective functions.",

All formats were based on the use of haptenenzyme conjugates enzyme tracers. Direct coating and precoating with goat anti-mouse antibodies or protein A were used. The formats using precoating steps turned out to be the most sensitive.

    "abstract": "Re-introduction programs for endangered animals operate under the hope that protected habitats can sustain viable populations that rely little on humans. The goal of these programs is to supply animals with the resources and skills they need to succeed in the modern wild. However predicting the set of skills necessary to respond to unpredictable selection events is difficult and efforts sometimes fail as animals respond inappropriately to environmental variation because they lack behavioral flexibility. Population resilience to environmental change may be enhanced if all members of a population do not exhibit the same response when selection pressures change. In many species individual animals express behavioral types that exhibit alternative responses to the same stimuli. Yet when animals are prepared for release to the wild there is rarely consideration of consistent behavioral variation between individuals. Since experience influences both behavioral and physiological responses to varied stimuli and can shape the future behavioral type of captive animals pre-release environmental enrichment may be successful in facilitating the expression of varied behavioral types in populations slated for release. This approach to environmental enrichment requires a departure from a one size fits all strategy and may also involve exposure to increased challenge and competition. In addition there is a need for empirical evidence to better understand the role of environmental enrichment and behavioral types on post-release success. The zoo environment provides an excellent arena for examining the development and expression of behavioral types and for taking a novel functional approach to environmental enrichment research that may prove to be very important to re-introduction efforts. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We report the first-in-human case series using this unique device. STUDY DESIGN We conducted a prospective single-center first-in-human pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and safety of creating an intestinal anastomosis using the Magnamosis device. Adult patients requiring any intestinal anastomosis to restore bowel continuity were eligible for inclusion. For each procedure 1 Harrison Ring was placed in the lumen of each intestinal segment. The rings were brought together and mated and left to form a side to side functional end to end anastomosis. Device movement was monitored with serial x-rays until it was passed in the stool. Patients were monitored for adverse effects with routine clinic appointments as well as questionnaires. RESULTS Five patients have undergone small bowel anastomosis with the Magnamosis device. All 5 patients had severe systemic disease and underwent complex open urinary reconstruction procedures with the device used to restore small bowel continuity after isolation of an ileal segment. All devices passed without obstruction or pain. No patients have had any complications related to their anastomosis including anastomotic leaks bleeding or stricture at median follow-up of 13 months. CONCLUSIONS In this initial case series from the first-in-human trial of the Magnamosis device the device was successfully placed and effectively formed a side to side functional end to end small bowel anastomosis in all 5 patients. No patients have had any anastomotic complications at intermediate follow-up.",

ELISA kits are commonly used to measure hormones however few ELISA kits are multiplex not all species-specific ELISA kits are commercially available and ELISA kits typically require a significant volume of biological fluids. Pigs resemble humans in digestive physiology making them an excellent model in preclinical research of nutrition and metabolism. In this study we developed and validated a simple liquidliquid extraction procedure and LC-MSMS method for the simultaneous quantification of insulin cortisol glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1 7-37 and 7-36 acyl and des-acyl ghrelin and carboxylated osteocalcin in pig serum. The proposed method is specific highly sensitive LOQ in ngmL and pgmL reasonably accurate more than 76.2 of all quality control samples within 20 error from nominal values and precise intra-day CV 10 and inter-day CV 23.1. The recoveries of all analytes and corresponding internal standards ranged from 83.7 to 116.0. The method also requires a low serum volume of 50100 L which is invaluable when sample volume is limited. These methods could be easily extended for use in other mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Surgical morbidity and mortality MM for patients with disseminated malignancy DMa is high and some have questioned the role of surgery. Therefore we sought to characterize temporal trends in MM among DMa patients hypothesizing that surgical intervention would remain prevalent. METHODS We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2006-2010. Excluding patients undergoing a primary hepatic operation we identified 21755 patients with DMa. Parametric andor nonparametric statistics and logistic regression were used to evaluate temporal trends and predictors of MM. RESULTS The prevalence of surgical intervention for DMa declined slightly over the time period from 1.9-1.6 of all procedures P 0.01. Among DMa patients the most frequent operations performed were bowel resection other gastrointestinal procedures and multivisceral resections these all showed small statistically significant decreases over time P 0.01. The rate of emergency operations also decreased P 0.01. In contrast the rate of preoperative independent functional status rose whereas the rate of preoperative weight loss and sepsis decreased P 0.01. Rates of 30-d morbidity 33.7 versus 26.6 serious morbidity 19.8 versus 14.2 and mortality 10.4 versus 9.3 all decreased over the study period P 0.05. Multivariate analysis identified standard predictors e.g. impaired functional status preoperative weight loss preoperative sepsis and hypoalbuminemia of worse 30-d MM. CONCLUSIONS Thirty-day morbidity serious morbidity and mortality have decreased incrementally for patients with DMa undergoing surgical intervention but surgical intervention remains prevalent. These data further highlight the importance of careful patient selection and goal-directed therapy in patients with incurable malignancy.",

Physicians specialty was recoded as otolaryngology all surgical specialties and all specialties combined. Physician offices with all- or partial-EMR system adoption were then compared to offices without EMR systems with respect to year geographic region urban setting office setting practice type practice ownership employment status and revenues from Medicare Medicaid private insurance and patient payment. RESULTS Upon univariate analysis EMR use was significantly higher among otolaryngology practices located in metropolitan areas and practices run or owned by larger groups of practitioners. Sources of patient revenue did not correlate with the likelihood of EMR use. Multivariate analysis revealed that EMR use by otolaryngologists was significantly associated with group practices and offices owned by institutions. Similar associations were observed with surgical specialties combined in addition to a higher EMR usage in practices with more than 25 of total revenue from private insurance. CONCLUSIONS EMR utilization by otolaryngology practices appears similar to that of other specialties and is more likely in metropolitan areas and larger practice settings. Despite the announcement of incentive programs under Medicare and Medicaid in 2009 EMR usage was not dependent on the percentage of physicians total revenue from these sources.",

All cats were treated with megavoltage radiation therapy to a total dose ranging from 22 to 48 Gy median dose 42 Gy. All cats were prescribed at least 6 months of multiagent chemotherapy. The median progression-free interval for all cats was 945 days 31 months. Two cats did not achieve clinical remission. Of 17 cats evaluable for relapse 10 58.8 were progression free during the entire follow-up period. Four cats 23.5 suffered local recurrence while three 17.6 experienced distant relapse. The median survival time was 955 days 31.4 months. The only variable found to have a significant negative impact on survival was destruction of the cribriform plate before therapy P 0.002. The long progression free and survival times reported here indicate that cats with stage I nasal lymphoma treated with aggressive local and systemic therapy can have a favorable outcome when compared with other anatomic forms of lymphoma. Despite strong clinical responses to the multimodality therapy used the fact that three 17.6 cats relapsed distantly supports the recommendation that treatment with radiation therapy alone is insufficient until further prospective studies can be performed.",

    "abstract": "Livestock grazing in North American rangelands has the capacity both to promote and control the spread of undesirable plant species. Within California annual grasslands desirable forage peaks in spring and supports considerable livestock grazing. However spring grazing appears to promote the invasion and spread of two late-season and unpalatable non-native annual grasses Aegilops triuncialis and Elymus caput-medusae. We tested the hypothesis that grazing reduces the leaf area and water use of early-spring annuals thus increasing residual soil water availability for the late-season species. We used grazing-exclosure experiments to examine the interactive effects of simulated grazing i.e. clipping and competition on soil moisture availability and on physiological phenological and demographic responses. When compared to unclipped controls spring clipping significantly increased late-season volumetric soil moisture by 1324 in the top 7 cm of soil and 811 in the top 20 cm of soil p 0.05 all sites which supported significantly higher rates of stomatal conductance 73100 increase in both late-season invading species p 0.01 all sites. Flowering was significantly delayed in clipped plots for both invader species suggesting these species experienced a longer growing period p 0.0001 in all cases. In competition plots the effects of clipping on the demographic response depended on neighborhood composition. When invaders were grown together no significant effect of clipping on survival or reproduction was detected in either invader. However when growing in mixtures with early-spring forage annuals or native species clipping increased survival and reproductive output in late-season invader species by 3-fold. We suggest that strategies for arresting or reversing the dominance of these late-season invasive annuals must recognize the influence of current biomass management strategies on late-season resource availability.",

Purchased foods such as rice and tinned fish became important energy and protein sources for all groups in Gavien. In comparison with intakes in the home areas mothers and children in Gavien had higher intakes of most nutrients except for those from the Grass Country who had lower protein and niacin intakes after resettlement. Dietary quality improved with resettlement because the traditional diet in lowland Papua New Guinea is monotonous and staple foods are low in nutrient density.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND A resurgence of aminoglycoside use has followed the recent increase of multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens and is often needed even in the treatment of dialysis-dependent patients however studies evaluating the treatment of gram-negative infections with aminoglycosides including the optimal dose in the setting of dialysis are limited. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the current patterns of aminoglycoside use including microbiologic and clinical indications and identify risk factors associated with mortality in dialysis-dependent patients receiving aminoglycosides. METHODS Utilization clinical and microbiologic data were collected retrospectively over a 2-year period July 2008-June 2010 for adults with a diagnosis of renal failure requiring dialysis and aminoglycoside therapy. Binary logistic and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS Ninety-five consecutive aminoglycoside courses in 88 patients met inclusion criteria for evaluation. A wide variety of clinical and microbiologic indications were documented. The average duration of aminoglycoside therapy was 5.2 days range 1-42 the average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 13.5 days 1-60 and the all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 36.5. Factors associated with all-cause 30-day mortality were gram-negative rod GNR bacteremia OR 28.6 p 0.035 advanced age OR 8.5 p 0.030 recent admission OR 33.4 p 0.038 and inadequate empiric therapy OR 14.9 p 0.024. Intravenous catheter removal was protective of all-cause 30-day mortality OR 0.01 p 0.005. A first pre-dialysis plasma concentration relative to the minimum inhibitory concentration CpMIC 6 mgL gentamicintobramycin was associated with an increased risk of mortality p 0.026 upon subgroup analysis of dialysis-dependent patients with GNR bloodstream infections. CONCLUSIONS Outcomes among dialysis-dependent patients who received aminoglycosides were below expectations. Various risk factors for mortality were identified including retention of the catheter inadequate empiric therapy and a CpMIC 6 mgL. Improved approaches to dosing of aminoglycosides in dialysis-dependent patients including more aggressive dosing practices should be urgently explored in attempts to maximize favorable patient outcomes.",

Intracranial extraskeletal chondrosarcomas are more rare often arising from the meninges at the falx tentorium or cerebral convexity. They are generally characterized as classical or mesenchymal with the latter associated with worse outcomes. We present our institutional series of falcine and parasagittal chondrosarcomas along with a review of the literature. Although skull base chondrosarcomas pose significant challenges due to their invasive biology and proximity to vital brainstem structures and cranial nerves intracranial extraskeletal chondrosarcomas are generally associated with a good prognosis. Our review of the literature identified 29 patients with falcine and parasagittal chondrosarcomas. There were six recurrences five among patients with the mesenchymal subtype and one in a patient with the classical subtype. All deaths occurred in patients with the mesenchymal subtype. Management of skull base chondrosarcomas is controversial but extraskeletal intracranial tumors can generally be managed by surgical resection alone. Treatment should be tailored to the biology of the tumor with radiation therapy reserved for patients with the mesenchymal subtype.",

METHODS Seventeen patients mean age 8.2 years underwent catheterization and coil occlusion of a PDA mean minimum diameter 1.9 mm. A nitinol snare was used to deliver and position the coil in the ductus. RESULTS A single Gianturco coil was placed successfully in all patients resulting in complete ductal occlusion documented by aortic angiography. Color echocardiography documented a trivial residual shunt in one patient who had no audible cardiac murmurs following the procedure. There was no hemodynamic or echocardiographic evidence of left pulmonary artery obstruction. There were no complications and all patients were discharged within 24 hr following the procedure. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous coil occlusion of the PDA is safe and effective. Snare-controlled coil delivery eliminates the risk of coil dislodgement and optimizes coil position.",

Animals - 6 mixed-breed dogs weighing between 23 and 50 kg. Procedure - Continuous ECG were recorded prior to and following IV administration of saline 0.9 NaCl solution and 0.02 0.04 and 0.06 mg of atropinekg of body weight. Heart rate and HRV within sympathetic and parasympathetic domains were determined using customized software and responses to treatments were compared. Each dog received all treatments with 2 days between treatments. Results - HR increased and HRV within the parasympathetic domain decreased after all atropine treatments compared with pretreatment values. Heart rate was significantly higher after administration of 0.06 mg of atropinekg than after 0.02 mgkg but was not different from HR after administration of 0.04 mgkg. Five of 6 dogs given the 0.04 or 0.06 mgkg dose attained HR 135 beatsmin but only 1 of 6 dogs given the 0.02 mgkg dose attained a HR 135 beatsmin. Heart rate variability within the parasympathetic domain decreased significantly from pretreatment values after all atropine treatments. Atropine doses of 0.04 and 0.06 mgkg induced significantly lower HRV than did the 0.02 mgkg dose but HRV after the higher doses were not different from each other. HRV within the sympathetic domain after any treatment did not change from pretreatment values. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - IV administration of 0.04 or 0.06 mg of atropinekg increased HR and induced complete parasympathetic blockade in clinically normal large-breed adult dogs.",

    "abstract": "In this study subtypes distribution and number of mast cells were investigated within mucosa and submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract of 24 cats with inflammatory bowel disease IBD in comparison to 11 control cats. Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed transmural gastrointestinal biopsies from stomach duodenum jejunum ileum and colon were examined. Mast cells were phenotyped and quantified based on their chymase and tryptase content by applying a combined enzyme-histochemical and immunohistochemical double-labeling technique and on their heparin content by a metachromatic staining method kresylecht-violet MCKEV. Mast cells containing both chymase and tryptase were not found in any of the samples examined. Furthermore in the stomach neither chymase MCC nor tryptase MCT bearing mast cells were detected. In cats with lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis or enterocolitis elevated numbers of MCT or MCC were identified in comparison to controls mainly located in the inflamed segments. The highest quantity of MCC was found in cats with eosinophilic gastroenterocolitis or enterocolitis in comparison to other IBD forms but only minor numbers of MCT were detected in these cases. In cats with fibrosing enteropathy FE a decrease of MCC and mast cells containing heparin was detected in affected segments while increased numbers of MCT were detected in all locations. The elevation in the number of MCT was higher in unaffected areas than in fibrotic regions. Regarding all IBD cases higher counts of MCC were found especially in the inflamed locations whereas in unaffected segments increased numbers of MCT were detected. The clear predominance of MCC and MCT within the mucosa and of MCKEV within the submucosa of all cats examined possibly represents differences of the cytokine milieu within the intestinal layers. In FE mast cells are possibly pivotal for the containment of the inflammatory process because of their antiinflammatory properties. The results of this study indicate that mast cells and their mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of different IBD forms in cats.",

    "abstract": "For monitoring of concussion brain function organ condition and other medical applications what is needed is a non-invasive method of monitoring tissue metabolism. MRI-based functional imaging technology detects changes in blood oxygenation a correlate of neural activity and thus may offer a prediction of prognosis in cases of concussion and other cerebral traumas. Yet potential relationships between perturbations to cerebral metabolism and patient outcomes cannot be effectively exploited clinically because we lack a practical low-cost non-invasive means to monitor cerebral oxygenation and metabolism in the emergency department operating room or medical facilities. We have developed a device to optically assay the redox state of Cytochrome-C-Oxidase CCO the mitochondrial enzyme responsible for the last step of the electron transport chain. Changes in CCO redox reflect changes in respiratory flux and thus changes in the rate of oxidative adenosine triphosphate ATP synthesis. In other words changes in CCO reflect brain cells metabolic activity more directly than the traditional blood oxygenation measurement methods. To non-invasively measure changes in CCO as well as blood oxygenation we have developed a Super-Continuum Infrared Spectroscopy of Cytochrome-C-Oxidase SCISCCO system that uses an all-fiber integrated super-continuum light source to simultaneously measure both of the new CCO and the traditional blood oxygenation markers of neural metabolism. The SCISCCO system is validated by confirming the near-infrared spectrum of CCO in vitro. To demonstrate in vivo feasibility the measured responses of oxygenation and CCO responses to acute ischemia e.g. blood pressure tests in human participants are compared to data from the literature. Furthermore we show that the new devices measurements of oxygenated HbO and deoxygenated HbR hemoglobin in response to breath hold challenges are principled and consistent with previously reported findings. The validated SCISCCO system is finally applied to measure cerebral oxygenation and the redox state of CCO in participants during an attention test protocol. Twenty-five healthy adults completed an attention task that included nine 60-second periods of attention task interleaved with 60-s periods of resting baseline. It has been well established that the frontal lobe of the human brain is active during tasks of attention. We therefore predicted that attention task should elicit an increase in HbO concentration accompanied by a decrease in redox state of CCO e.g. ratio of oxidized CCO to reduced CCO in frontal lobe brain regions as measured with the SCISCCO system. Our findings are consistent with our predictions HbO concentration increases while CCO concentration decreases during the attention blocks relative to the resting baseline thereby indicating an increase in oxidative metabolism of the frontal lobe brain regions of interest. Our systematic multi-method approach thus validates the new device as well as the validity of the metabolic biomarkers that it measures. The SCISCCO system could be a new tool for monitoring brain and organ metabolism which could be invaluable for screening concussion patients or use in an operating or emergency room to gauge patients organ response to treatments.",

    "abstract": "The potential for differences between genetic paternity and paternity inferred from behavioral observation has long been recognized. These differences are associated with the challenge for females of seeking both genetic and material benefits this challenge is less severe in species with polygynous non-resource-based mating systems such as leks than in those with resource-based systems. We present the first study of paternity patterns in a non-resource-based species that does not form true leks. We compared paternity inferred from observed mating behavior to genetically assigned paternity in the Satin Bowerbird Ptilonorhynchus violaceus using eight microsatellite markers. Mating behavior was observed and recorded via automated video-cameras positioned at all bowers 29-34 bowers each year in the study site throughout each mating season. We obtained blood samples and identified mothers for 11 chicks in 9 nests. For all chicks the most likely genetic father had been observed to mate with the mother in the year the chick was sampled. All most likely genetic fathers were assigned with high confidence and all were bower-holding males. These results demonstrate that genetic paternity can be inferred from observed mating behavior with reasonable confidence in Satin Bowerbirds. Observed male mating-success is therefore a reliable predictor of reproductive success and this suggests that high skew in observed male mating-success translates directly to high skew in reproductive success.

    "abstract": "Despite the clinically significant impact of executive dysfunction on the outcomes of adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorders ASD we lack a clear understanding of its prevalence profile and development. To address this gap we administered the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery to a cross-sectional Intelligence Quotient IQ case-matched cohort with ASD n 66 and typical development TD n 66 ages 12-22. We used a general linear model framework to examine group differences in task performance and their associations with age. Latent profile analysis LPA was used to identify subgroups of individuals with similar cognitive profiles. Compared to IQ case-matched controls ASD demonstrated poorer performance on inhibitory control P 0.001 cognitive flexibility P 0.001 episodic memory P 0.02 and processing speed P 0.001 components of Fluid Cognition but not on vocabulary or word reading components of Crystallized Cognition. There was a significant positive association between age and Crystallized and Fluid Cognition in both groups. For Fluid but not Crystallized Cognition ASD performed more poorly than TD at all ages. A four-group LPA model based on subtest scores best fit the data. Eighty percent of ASD belonged to two groups that exhibited relatively stronger Crystallized versus Fluid Cognition. Attention deficits were not associated with Toolbox subtest scores but were lowest in the group with the lowest proportion of autistic participants. Adaptive functioning was poorer in the groups with the greatest proportion of autistic participants. Autistic persons are especially impaired on Fluid Cognition and this more flexible form of thinking remains poorer in the ASD group through adolescence. LAY SUMMARY A set of brief tests of cognitive functioning called the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery was administered to adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorders ASD n 66 and typical development TD n 66 ages 12-22 years. Compared to TD ASD showed poorer performance in inhibiting responses acting flexibly memorizing events and processing information quickly Fluid Cognition. Groups did not differ on vocabulary or word reading Crystallized Cognition. Crystallized and Fluid Cognition increased with age in both groups but the ASD group showed lower Fluid but not Crystallized Cognition than TD at all ages. A categorization analysis including all participants showed that most participants with ASD fell into one of two categories a group characterized by poor performance across all tasks or a group characterized by relatively stronger Crystallized compared to Fluid Cognition. Adaptive functioning was poorer for participants in these groups which consisted of mostly individuals with ASD while ADHD symptoms were lowest in the group with the greatest proportion of TD participants.",

SNPs and deletions causing a truncation of the 3c gene product were found in almost all isolates from the diseased tissues of the eight cats suffering from FIP whereas most but not all fecal isolates from these same cats had intact 3c genes. Other accessory and structural genes appeared normal in both fecal and lesional viruses. Deliterious mutations in the 3c gene were unique to each cat indicating that they did not originate in one cat and were subsequently passed horizontally to the others. Compartmentalization of the parental and mutant forms was not absolute virus of lesional type was sometimes found in feces of affected cats and virus identical to fecal type was occasionally identified in diseased tissues. Although 3c gene mutants in this study were not horizontally transmitted the parental fecal virus was readily transmitted by contact from a cat that died of FIP to its housemate. There was a high rate of mutability in all structural and accessory genes both within and between cats leading to minor genetic variants. More than one variant could be identified in both diseased tissues and feces of the same cat. Laboratory cats inoculated with a mixture of two closely related variants from the same FIP cat developed disease from one or the other variant but not both. Significant genetic drift existed between isolates from geographically distinct regions of the Western US.",

    "abstract": "Lovastatin an inhibitor of protein prenylation was reported to inhibit DNA synthesis and induce apoptosis in cultured cells. This report describes the morphological consequences of lovastatin treatment. Lovastatin 50 microM induced mesangial cell rounding and disassembly of actin stress fibers within 24 to 48 h. After 48 to 72 h of lovastatin treatment the cells detached from the substratum and underwent apoptotic cell death as evidenced by condensed nuclear chromatin nuclear fragmentation cell blebbing and decrease in cell size. Time lapse cinematography revealed that lovastatin caused cell rounding by either inhibiting cytokinesis or cell spreading following cytokinesis. Lovastatin-induced cell rounding detachment and apoptosis were dependent upon cell proliferation. These effects were prevented by serum deprivation to inhibit cell proliferation or by plating cells at densities which resulted in contact inhibition of cell growth. Lovastatin-induced mesangial cell rounding and apoptosis were also prevented by the inclusion of the isoprenoids all-trans-farnesol or all-trans-geranylgeraniol in the incubation medium. These results indicate that the effects of lovastatin were mediated by inhibition of protein isoprenylation because exogenous all-trans-geranylgeraniol can be used only in protein prenylation. The small GTP-binding protein RhoA which may be important for cell spreading and cytokinesis accumulated in the cytosol following treatment with lovastatin suggestive of its inactivation. This effect was also prevented by the inclusion of either farnesol or geranylgeraniol in the incubation medium. Thus lovastatin-induced apoptosis in mesangial cells occurs by interfering with prenylation dependent mitotic and post-mitotic events.",

The emphasis is on analysis of details of models and how well the models compete with experimental structures. Performance of contributing research groups is measured in terms of backbone accuracy all-atom local geometry and the ability to estimate local errors in models. Separate analyses for all participating groups and automatic servers were carried out. Compared with the last CASP two years ago there have been significant improvements in a number of areas particularly the accuracy of protein backbone atoms accuracy of sequence alignment between models and available structures increased accuracy over that which can be obtained from simple copying of a closest template and accuracy of modeling of sub-structures not present in the closest template. These advancements are likely associated with more effective strategies to build non-template regions of the targets ab initio better algorithms to combine information from multiple templates enhanced refinement methods and better methods for estimating model accuracy.",

SUBJECTS AND METHODS The American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6657 Trial prospectively enrolled women with 3 cm invasive breast cancer receiving NACT. Preoperative measurements of residual disease included longest diameter by mammography MRI and clinical examination and functional volume on MRI. The accuracy of preoperative measurements for detecting pathologic CR and the association with final pathology size were assessed for all lesions separately for single masses and nonmass enhancements NMEs multiple masses and lesions without ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS. RESULTS In the 138 women with all four preoperative measures longest diameter by MRI showed the highest accuracy for detecting pathologic CR for all lesions and NME AUC 0.76 and 0.84 respectively. There was little difference across preoperative measurements in the accuracy of detecting pathologic CR for single masses AUC 0.69-0.72. Longest diameter by MRI and longest diameter by clinical examination showed moderate ability for detecting pathologic CR for multiple masses AUC 0.78 and 0.74 and longest diameter by MRI and longest diameter by mammography showed moderate ability for detecting pathologic CR for tumors without DCIS AUC 0.74 and 0.71. In subjects with residual disease longest diameter by MRI exhibited the strongest association with pathology size for all lesions and single masses r 0.33 and 0.47. Associations between preoperative measures and pathology results were not significantly influenced by tumor subtype or mammographic density. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that measurement of longest diameter by MRI is more accurate than by mammography and clinical examination for preoperative assessment of tumor residua after NACT and may improve surgical planning.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8 belongs to a heterogenous group of vision and life-threatening neurodegenerative diseases neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis NCL. Effective therapy is limited to a single drug for treatment of ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 necessitating animal disease models to facilitate further therapeutic development. Murine models are advantageous for therapeutic development due to easy genetic manipulation and rapid breeding however appropriate genetic models need to be identified and characterized before being used for therapy testing. To date murine models of ocular disease associated with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8 have only been characterized in motor neuron degeneration mice. METHODS Cln8-- mice were produced by CRISPRCas9 genome editing through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. Ophthalmic examination optical coherence tomography electroretinography and ocular histology was performed on Cln8-- mice and controls at 16 weeks of age. Quantification of all retinal layers retinal pigmented epithelium and the choriocapillaris was performed using images acquired with ocular coherence tomography and planimetry of histologic sections. Necropsy was performed to investigate concurrent systemic abnormalities. Clinical correlation with human patients with CLN8-associated retinopathy is provided. RESULTS Retinal degeneration characterized by retinal pigment epithelium mottling scattered drusen and retinal vascular attenuation was noted in all Cln8-- mice. Loss of inner and outer photoreceptor segment demarcation was noted on optical coherence tomography with significant thinning of the whole retina P1e-9 outer nuclear layer P1e-9 and combined photoreceptor segments P1e-9. A global reduction in scotopic and photopic electroretinographic waveforms was noted in all Cln8-- mice. Slight thickening of the inner plexiform layer P0.02 and inner nuclear layer P0.004 with significant thinning of the whole retina P0.03 outer nuclear layer P0.01 and outer photoreceptor segments P0.001 was appreciated on histologic sections. Scattered lipid vacuoles were noted in splenic red pulp of all Cln8-- mice though no gross systemic abnormalities were detected on necropsy. Retinal findings are consistent with those seen in patients with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8. CONCLUSIONS This study provides detailed clinical characterization of retinopathy in adult Cln8-- mice. Findings suggest that Cln8-- mice may provide a useful murine model for development of novel therapeutics needed for treating ocular disease in patients with ceroid lipofuscinosis type 8.",

We have previously identified ionotropic glutamate receptor-like genes GLRs in Arabidopsis thaliana an organism that lacks a nervous system. Upon the completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequencing project a large family of GLR genes has been uncovered. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis divides the AtGLR gene family into three clades and is used as the basis for the recently established nomenclature for the AtGLR gene family. We performed a phylogenetic analysis with extensive annotations of the iGluR gene family which includes all 20 Arabidopsis GLR genes the entire iGluR family from rat except NR3 and two prokaryotic iGluRs Synechocystis GluR0 and Anabaena GluR. Our analysis supports the division of the AtGLR gene family into three clades and identifies potential functionally important amino acid residues that are conserved in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic iGluRs as well as those that are only conserved in AtGLRs. To begin to investigate whether the three AtGLR clades represent different functional classes we performed the first comprehensive mRNA expression analysis of the entire AtGLR gene family. On the basis of RT-PCR all AtGLRs are expressed genes. The three AtGLR clades do not show distinct clade-specific organ expression patterns. All 20 AtGLR genes are expressed in the root. Among them five of the nine clade-II genes are root-specific in 8-week-old Arabidopsis plants.",

We characterize global trends in dietary quality by estimating micronutrient density of the food supply prevalence of inadequate intake of 14 micronutrients and average prevalence of inadequate intake of these micronutrients for all countries between 1961 and 2011. Over this 50-year period the estimated prevalence of inadequate intakes of micronutrients has declined in all regions due to increased total production of food andor micronutrient density. This decline has been particularly strong in East and Southeast Asia and weaker in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where dietary micronutrient density has declined over this 50-year period. At the global level micronutrients with the lowest levels of adequate estimated intake are calcium iron vitamin A and zinc but there are strong differences between countries and regions. Fortification has reduced the estimated prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intakes in all low-income regions except South Asia. The food supply in many countries is still far below energy requirements which suggests a need to increase the availability and accessibility of nutritious foods. Countries where the food energy supply is adequate show a very large variation in dietary quality and in many of these countries people would benefit from more diverse diets with a greater proportion of micronutrient-dense foods.

    "abstract": "Metabolomics provides a valuable strategy for describing and annotating the structures compositions and functions of mammalian milk. Detailed analyses of the complex components of milk have revealed an unexpected diversity of glycans consisting of oligosaccharides glycoproteins and glycolipids all of which help shape the intestinal environment and in particular the intestinal microbiome of breastfed babies. Using complete and partial ensembles of glycan mixtures the holistic principles of metabolomics analytics were leveraged for microbial screening studies. The complex glycans of human milk proved to be highly selective in their ability to support the growth of only a very rare group of enteric bacteria. These studies led to the conclusion that a signature achievement of breast milk is the development of a unique milk-oriented intestinal microbiota that results from a functional overlap of stereospecific glycan biosynthesis in maternal mammary epithelia with equally stereospecific glycosidase enzymes encoded within the genome of the commensal bacteria. Clinical evidence in support of that hypothesis has now been generated by the simultaneous administration and quantitation of the entire repertoire of glycans in the milk going in and the feces coming out of human infants. These platforms of systems biology combining separation technologies coupled to highly accurate and sensitive mass spectrometry with exhaustive library development and computational tools provide a model for success in understanding biological processes. Metabolomics is now extending that understanding of the infant microbiota and its phenotype to the role of complex glycans in the microbiota of all ages. The relentless selective pressure on the process of lactation within the mammary epithelial cell over millennia of evolution has been to nourish protect and support the survival of the mother infant pair. The principles that have emerged to nourish infants provide a guiding model for diet and health of all humans. The tools of metabolomics are proving successful in revealing the mechanisms behind milks genius.",

Of the 34 variants that have been identified in KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase KIT 27 have only been reported in a single individual or family and thus not all are routinely offered for genetic testing. Therefore to enable proper use of marker-assisted selection determining breed specificity for these alleles is warranted. Screening 19 unregistered all-white Shetland ponies for 16 white patterning markers identified 14 individuals whose phenotype could not be explained by testing results. In evaluating other known dominant white variants 14 horses were heterozygous for W13. W13 was previously only reported in two quarter horses and a family of Australian miniature horses. Genotyping known white spotting variants in 30 owner-reported white animals 25 Miniature Horses and five Shetland ponies identified two additional W13N American Miniature Horses. The estimated allele frequency of W13 in the American Miniature Horse was 0.0063 79 NN 1 W13N and the allele was not detected in a random sample n 59 of Shetland ponies. No homozygous W13 individuals were identified and W13N ponies had a similar all-white coat with pink skin phenotype regardless of the other white spotting variants present demonstrating that W13 results in a Mendelian inherited dominant white phenotype and homozygosity is likely lethal. These findings document the presence of W13 in the American Miniature Horse and Shetland pony populations at a low frequency and illustrate the importance of testing for this variant in additional breeds.",

However little is known about cumulative exposure or windows of susceptibility to greenness exposure. Using inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models IPWMSM we estimated effects of greenness exposure from birth through adolescence on executive function and behavior. We analyzed data of 908 children from Project Viva enrolled at birth in 1999-2002 and followed up until early adolescence. In mid-childhood median 7.7 years and early adolescence 13.1 years executive function and behavior were assessed using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire SDQ. Greenness was measured at birth early childhood mid-childhood and early adolescence using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. We used inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models to estimate effects of interventions that ensure maximum greenness exposure versus minimum through all intervals and that ensure maximum greenness only in early childhood vs. minimum through all intervals. Results of the effects of maximum vs. minimum greenness at all timepoints did not suggest associations with mid-childhood outcomes. Estimates of maximum greenness only in early childhood vs. minimum suggested a beneficial association with mid-childhood SDQ -3.21 99 CI -6.710.29 mother-rated -4.02 99 CI -7.87-0.17 teacher-rated. No associations were observed with early adolescent outcomes. Our results for persistent maximum greenness exposure on behavior were not conclusive with confidence intervals containing the null. The results for maximum greenness only in early childhood may shed light on sensitive periods of greenness exposure for behavior regulation.",

    "abstract": "A previous polymorphism survey of the type 2 diabetes gene CAPN10 identified a segment showing an excess of polymorphism levels in all population samples coinciding with localized breakdown of linkage disequilibrium LD in a sample of Hausa from Cameroon but not in non-African samples. This raised the possibility that a recombination hotspot is present in all populations and we had insufficient power to detect it in the non-African data. To test this possibility we estimated the crossover rate by sperm typing in five non-African men these estimates were consistent with the LD decay in the non-African but not in the Hausa data. Moreover resequencing the orthologous region in a sample of Western chimpanzees did not show either an excess of polymorphism level or rapid LD decay suggesting that the processes underlying the patterns observed in humans operated only on the human lineage. These results suggest that a hotspot of recombination has recently arisen in humans and has reached higher frequency in the Hausa than in non-Africans or that there is no elevation in crossover rate in any human population and the observed variation results from long-standing balancing selection.",

Benzene is found to non-dissociatively adsorb at 300 K with the ring plane parallel to the surface at all coverages. Pyridine is adsorbed in a similar configuration at low coverages but at higher coverages the majority of the molecules are bound through the N atom and stand proud of the surface. Near-complete H-D exchange occurs in benzene at all coverages but only for the low coverage phase of pyridine. It is proposed that the very incomplete exchange observed at saturation coverage is due to the inaccessibility of the 345 ring positions in -bonded pyridine. 1987.",

    "abstract": "The role of factors such as frequency contraction duration and active time in the adaptation to chronic low-frequency electrical stimulation CLFS is widely disputed. In this study we explore the ability of contraction duration 0.6 6 60 and 600 sec to induce a fast-to-slow shift in engineered muscle while using a stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and keeping active time constant at 60. We found that all contraction durations induced similar slowing of time-to-peak tension. Despite similar increases in total myosin heavy MHC levels with stimulation increasing contraction duration resulted in progressive decreases in total fast myosin. With contraction durations of 60 and 600 sec MHC IIx levels decreased and MHC IIa levels increased. All contraction durations resulted in fast-to-slow shifts in TnT and TnC but increased both fast and slow TnI levels. Half-relaxation slowed to a greater extent with contraction durations of 60 and 600 sec despite similar changes in the calcium sequestering proteins calsequestrin and parvalbumin and the calcium uptake protein SERCA. All CLFS groups resulted in greater fatigue resistance than control. Similar increases in GLUT4 mitochondrial enzymes SDH and ATPsynthase the fatty acid transporter CPT-1 and the metabolic regulators PGC-1 and MEF2 were found with all contraction durations. However the mitochondrial enzymes cytochrome C and citrate synthase were increased to greater levels with contraction durations of 60 and 600 sec. These results demonstrate that contraction duration plays a pivotal role in dictating the level of CLFS-induced contractile and metabolic adaptations in tissue-engineered skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "The responses of neurons in monkey extrastriate areas MT middle temporal and MST medial superior temporal and the initial metrics of saccadic and pursuit eye movements have previously been shown to be better predicted by vector averaging or winner-take-all models depending on the stimulus conditions. To investigate the potential influences of attention on the neuronal activity we measured the responses of single MT and MST neurons under identical stimulus conditions when one of two moving stimuli was the target for a pursuit eye movement. We found the greatest attentional modulation across neurons when two stimuli moved through the receptive field RF of the neuron and the stimulus motion was initiated at least 450 ms before reaching the center of the RF. These conditions were the same as those in which a winner-take-all model better predicted both the eye movements and the underlying neuronal activity. The modulation was almost always an increase of activity and it was about equally frequent in MT and MST. A modulation of 50 was observed in approximately 41 of MT neurons and 27 of MST neurons. Responses to all directions of motion were modulated so that the direction tuning curves in the attended and unattended conditions were similar. Changes in the background activity with target selection were small and unlikely to account for the observed attentional modulation. In contrast there was little change in the neuronal response with attention when the stimulus reached the RF center 150 ms after motion onset which was also the condition in which the vector average model better predicted the initial eye movements and the activity of the neurons. These results are consistent with a competition model of attention in which top-down attention acts on the activity of one of two competing populations of neurons activated by the bottom-up input from peripheral stimuli. They suggest that there is a minimal separation of the populations necessary before attention can act on one population similar to that required to produce a winner-take-all mode of behavior in pursuit initiation. The present experiments also suggest that it takes several hundred milliseconds to develop this top-down attention effect.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the merger histories of isolated dwarf galaxies based on a suite of 15 highresolution cosmological zoom-in simulations all with masses of Mhalo 1010M and M 105 - 107M at z 0 from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. The stellar populations of these dwarf galaxies at z 0 are formed essentially entirely in situ over 90 per cent of the stellar mass is formed in the main progenitor in all but two cases and all 15 of the galaxies have 70 per cent of their stellar mass formed in situ. Virtually all galaxy mergers occur prior to z 3 meaning that accreted stellar populations are ancient. On average our simulated dwarfs undergo five galaxy mergers in their lifetimes with typical pre-merger galaxy mass ratios that are less than 110. This merger frequency is generally comparable to what has been found in dissipationless simulations when coupled with abundance matching. Two of the simulated dwarfs have a luminous satellite companion at z 0. These ultra-faint dwarfs lie at or below current detectability thresholds but are intriguing targets for nextgeneration facilities. The small contribution of accreted stars makes it extremely difficult to discern the effects of mergers in the vast majority of dwarfs either photometrically or using resolved-star colour-magnitude diagrams CMDs. The important implication for near-field cosmology is that star formation histories SFHs of comparably massive galaxies derived from resolved CMDs should trace the build-up of stellar mass in one main system across cosmic time as opposed to reflecting the contributions of many individual SFHs of merged dwarfs.",

    "abstract": "The exponential rise in molecular and genomic data has generated a vast array of therapeutic targets. Oligonucleotide-based technologies to down regulate these molecular targets have promising therapeutic efficacy. However there is relatively limited success in translating this into effective in vivo cancer therapeutics. The primary challenge is the lack of effective cancer cell-targeted delivery methods particularly for a systemic disease such as leukemia. We developed a novel leukemia-targeting compound composed of a monoclonal antibody directly conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide ASO. Our compound uses an ASO that specifically targets the transcription factor MAX dimerization protein 3 MXD3 which was previously identified to be critical for precursor B cell preB acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL cell survival. The MXD3 ASO was conjugated to an anti-CD22 antibody CD22 Ab that specifically targets most preB ALL. We demonstrated that the CD22 Ab-ASO conjugate treatment showed MXD3 protein knockdown and leukemia cell apoptosis in vitro. We also demonstrated that the conjugate treatment showed cytotoxicity in normal B cells but not in other hematopoietic cells including hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore the conjugate treatment at the lowest dose tested 0.2mgkg Ab for 6 doses - twice a week for 3 weeks more than doubled the mouse survival time in both Reh median survival time 20.5 vs. 42.5 days p0.001 and primary preB ALL median survival time 29.3 vs. 63 days p0.001 xenograft models. Our conjugate that uses CD22 Ab to target the novel molecule MXD3 which is highly expressed in preB ALL cells appears to be a promising novel therapeutic approach.",

In this study we evaluated the chemotherapeutic efficacy of 5 novel phospho-NSAIDs each of which includes in addition to the NSAID moiety a diethylphosphate linked through a butane moiety. All 5 compounds inhibited the growth of human breast colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines with micromolar potency. In vivo investigations confirmed the antitumor activity of phospho-aspirin PA and phospho-sulindac PS in inhibiting tumor growth in established human xenograft models in which cell proliferation was suppressed and apoptosis enhanced in the absence of detectable animal toxicity. Notably all of the phospho-NSAIDs tested induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in cultured cells with PA and PS inducing detectable levels of oxidative stress in vivo that were associated positively with apoptosis and negatively with proliferation. Potentially explaining these effects all of the phospho-NSAIDs tested also inhibited the thioredoxin system and the redox sensitive transcription factor NF-B. Taken together our findings show the strong anticancer efficacy and promising safety of phospho-NSAIDs in preclinical models of breast colon and pancreatic cancer suggesting further evaluation as anticancer agents.",

A classical biological control program against H. vitripennis was initiated in 2004 aiming to introduce the exotic egg parasitoid Gonatocerus ashmeadi Girault Hymenoptera Mymaridae to the Society Islands archipelago. Prior to any release two risks were assessed a continued uncontrolled H. vitripennis spread and proliferation in French Polynesia and b non-target impacts by G. ashmeadi on indigenous French Polynesian cicadellids. The primary risk of H. vitripennis is its potential to vector the lethal plant bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. While the presence of X. fastidiosa in French Polynesia has not yet been demonstrated the presence of uncontrolled H. vitripennis greatly elevates the risk of a disease outbreak and thus represents a major threat for numerous plant species. Assessing the risk of G. ashmeadi introduction for native cicadellids first required an inventory of the Cicadellidae of the Society Islands resulting in at least 14 cicadellid species nine not previously recorded. The risk to these species of attack by G. ashmeadi was assessed using four criteria 1 their phylogenetic relationships to known hosts of G. ashmeadi and their similarity in 2 body size 3 egg laying biology and 4 ecology. All indigenous cicadellid species found were considered to be at low risk of attack because they differed greatly from all known hosts for G. ashmeadi 1 none of the indigenous species are in the tribe Proconiini 2 all were very small and when possible to determine 3 lay tiny single eggs which 4 are deposited on the undersides of leaves of trees. These results persuaded the French Polynesian Government that the benefits of establishing G. ashmeadi for H. vitripennis control outweighed the serious potential risks associated with either delaying release or not releasing G. ashmeadi in French Polynesia. Releases of G. ashmeadi in Tahiti began in May 2005. 2007 Taylor Francis.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To investigate the variety of cases that are performed by newly graduated fellowship-trained orthopedic hand surgeons. METHODS All cases submitted by board-eligible orthopedic surgeons taking part II of their board examination between 2004 and 2013 were obtained from the database of the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery ABOS. Each case was then categorized based on the fellowship training of the treating surgeon and whether it was a hand surgery case. Each hand surgery case was then further categorized into 1 of the 8 surgical categories used by the ABOS to determine eligibility for the Subspecialty Certificate in Orthopaedic Surgery of the Hand SCOSH. RESULTS During our study period 6854 orthopedic surgeons submitted 858146 cases to the ABOS. Fellowship-trained hand surgeons made up 13 of all surgeons and 24 of all submitted cases were hand surgery cases. Based on the cases submitted 44 of hand surgeons were not on track to become eligible for the SCOSH. The most common reason for not reaching eligibility was failure to meet the minimum requirements in 1 of either the congenital the skin and wound problems the contracture and joint stiffness the microvascular or the tumor categories. CONCLUSIONS A large proportion of fellowship-trained orthopedic hand surgeons are not on track to meet the minimum eligibility requirements for the ABOS SCOSH during their part II case collections. Their case profile is not sufficiently diverse to be considered an active hand surgery practice for the purpose of SCOSH eligibility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study highlights 1 possible reason why over one-third of young hand surgeons do not obtain their subspecialty certification.",

The herd of 133 females was divided for mating into 4 groups and mated with different bulls. The disease was observed in the offspring of 5 cows from only 1 group over a period of 6 years. These cows had all mated with the same bull during that period. All affected calves were unable to suckle showed intention tremors involuntary movements of the ears depression and blindness. Some calves were recumbent and others showed wide-based stance and inability to walk. At necropsy all affected calves had similar lesions consisting of hydranencephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia. Histologically the cavities were surrounded by normal-looking nervous tissue. The occurrence of the disease in the offspring of only 1 out of 6 bulls in different years the similar lesions in all 7 calves affected and the negative serology and immunohistochemistry for Bovine virus diarrhea virus and Bluetongue virus highly suggest that the disease is hereditary.",

ANIMALS 28 sick foals without sepsis 21 foals with sepsis and 21 healthy foals. PROCEDURES Total RNA was extracted from blood samples and converted into complementary DNA cDNA. Gene expression was measured for the molecular markers by use of real-time PCR assay and final quantitation was performed with the comparative threshold cycle method. RESULTS Samples from all foals yielded transcription for all markers. Expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta was significantly lower and that of IL-8 significantly greater in the sick-nonseptic and septic groups compared with the healthy group. No significant difference in expression of IL-1beta IL-6 and PCT was found between the healthy group and the 2 sick groups. Expression of IL-10 was significantly greater in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The cytokine profile in foals with sepsis may suggest an immunosuppressive state. Expression of IL-10 may be a marker for identification of foals with a guarded prognosis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND In many low-income settings despite improvements in sanitation and hygiene groundwater sources used for drinking may be contaminated with enteric pathogens such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia which remain important causes of childhood morbidity. In this study we examined the contribution of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium and Giardia found in groundwater sources used for drinking to the total burden of diarrheal disease among children 5 in rural India. METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS We studied a population of 3385 children 5 years of age in 100 communities of Puri District Odisha India. We developed a coupled quantitative microbial risk assessment QMRA and susceptible-infected-recovered SIR population model based on observed levels of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in improved groundwater sources used for drinking and compared the QMRA-SIR estimates with independently measured all-cause i.e. all fecal-oral enteric pathogens and exposure pathways child diarrhea prevalence rates observed in the study population during two monsoon seasons 2012 and 2013. We used site specific and regional studies to inform assumptions about the human pathogenicity of the Cryptosporidium and Giardia species present in local groundwater. In all three human pathogenicity scenarios evaluated the mean daily risk of Cryptosporidium or Giardia infection 0.06-1.53 far exceeded the tolerable daily risk of infection from drinking water in the US 0.0001. Depending on which protozoa species were present median estimates of daily child diarrhea prevalence due to either Cryptosporidium or Giardia infection from drinking water was as high as 6.5 or as low as 1 and accounted for at least 2.9 and as much as 65.8 of the all-cause diarrhea disease burden measured in children 5 during the study period. Cryptosporidium tended to account for a greater share of estimated waterborne protozoa infections causing diarrhea than did Giardia. Diarrhea prevalence estimates for waterborne Cryptosporidium infection appeared to be most sensitive to assumptions about the probability of infection from ingesting a single parasite i.e. the rate parameter in dose-response model while Giardia infection was most sensitive to assumptions about the viability of parasites detected in groundwater samples. CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE Protozoa in groundwater drinking sources in rural India even at low concentrations especially for Cryptosporidium may account for a significant portion of child diarrhea morbidity in settings were tubewells are used for drinking water and should be more systematically monitored. Preventing diarrheal disease burdens in Puri District and similar settings will benefit from ensuring water is microbiologically safe for consumption and consistent and effective household water treatment is practiced.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The lifetime risk and expected cost of trauma care would be valuable for health policy planners but this information is currently unavailable. The cumulative incidence rates methodology based on a cross-sectional population analysis offers an alternative approach to prohibitively costly prospective cohort studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development OSHPD database was performed for 2008. Trauma admissions were identified by ICD-9 primary diagnosis codes 800-959 with certain exclusions. Cumulative incidence rates were calculated as the cumulative summation of incidence risks sequentially across age groups. RESULTS A total of 2.2 million admissions were identified with mean age of 63.8 y 49.6 men 82.8 Whites 5.7 Blacks 11.3 Hispanics and 3.1 Asians. The cumulative incidence rate for patients older than age 85 y was 1119 per 10000 people with the majority of risk in the elderly compared with 24325 per 10000 people for all-cause hospitalizations. The rates were 946 for men 1079 for women 999 for non-Hispanic Whites 568 for Blacks 577 for Hispanics and 395 for Asians per 10000 population. The cumulative expected hospital charge was 6538 compared with 81257 for all-cause hospitalizations. CONCLUSION The cumulative lifetime risk of traumainjury requiring hospitalization for a person living to age 85 y in California is 11.2 accounting for 4.6 of expected lifetime hospitalizations but accounting for 8.0 of expected lifetime hospital expenditures. Risk of trauma is significant in the elderly. The total expenditure for all trauma hospitalizations in California was 7.62 billion in 2008.",

However many families in the United States do not apply for FRPM and many eligible students do not eat school meals possibly due to stigma. METHODS This study is a secondary qualitative analysis derived from a mixed-methods study. Interviews were conducted with 66 parents in California and Maine during the 2021-2022 school year when school meals were free for all students nationwide through a universal free school meals UFSM policy. Approximately half 56 of parents had children who previously qualified for FRPM based on household income and completed a school meal application or were directly certified for free school meals in prior school years. Interviews examined parents self-reported FRPM application stigma perceived child school meal stigma and opinions on UFSM. Thematic analysis was used to systematically code and analyze all qualitative data. RESULTS Major themes included parent stigma associated with school meal applications parents perception of child stigma when participating in school meals and UFSMs ability to reduce stigma for parents and children. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH POLICY PRACTICE AND EQUITY Statewide and federal UFSM policies may reduce stigma for both parents and children. CONCLUSIONS While not all parents reported feeling stigmatized when completing FRPM applications most parents perceived that children experience school meal stigma. Parents believed that UFSM policies reduced stigma for families and children.",

We hypothesize that implementation challenges extend beyond surgical skills training and initial REBOA use should not be expected to mirror published success. METHODS All REBOA placements from January 2016 to February 2017 at a level 1 trauma center were reviewed for opportunities for improvement. From September 2016 to February 2017 all patients meeting highest trauma activation criteria were reviewed against our REBOA algorithm to identify patients meeting criteria for REBOA placement but not undergoing the procedure. RESULTS REBOA was introduced at our institution in September 2015 with the first placement in January 2016. Trauma surgery emergency department and operating room staff underwent training. Nine patients had REBOA placed with six survivors. One patient underwent an unsuccessful REBOA attempt and died. Four patients had complications from REBOA. Eight additional patients met indications but did not undergo REBOA. CONCLUSIONS Successful REBOA use requires more than teaching surgeons indications and techniques. For a successful REBOA program system factors must be addressed. System processes must ensure equipment and procedures are standardized and familiar to all involved. Complications should be expected.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis a major public health problem is becoming increasingly prevalent with the aging of the world population. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength which predisposes the individual to an increased risk of fractures of the hip spine and other skeletal sites. The clinical consequences and economic burden of this disease call for measures to assess individuals who are at high risk to allow for appropriate intervention. Many risk factors are associated with osteoporotic fracture including low peak bone mass hormonal factors the use of certain drugs eg glucocorticoids cigarette smoking low physical activity low intake of calcium and vitamin D race small body size and a personal or a family history of fracture. All of these factors should be taken into account when assessing the risk of fracture and determining whether further treatment is required. Because osteoporotic fracture risk is higher in older women than in older men all postmenopausal women should be evaluated for signs of osteoporosis during routine physical examinations. Radiologic laboratory assessments of bone mineral density generally should be reserved for patients at highest risk including all women over the age of 65 younger postmenopausal women with risk factors and all postmenopausal women with a history of fractures. The evaluation of biochemical markers of bone turnover has been useful in clinical research. However the predictive factor of these measurements is not defined clearly and these findings should not be used as a replacement for bone density testing. Together clinical assessment of osteoporotic risk factors and objective measures of bone mineral density can help to identify patients who will benefit from intervention and thus can potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporosis-associated fractures in this population.",

METHODS This study determined the phenotype and genotype of AMR extended-spectrum -lactamase ESBL production and virulence factors of A. hydrophila Salmonella spp. and V. cholerae isolated from hybrid red tilapia and cultivation water in Thailand. Standard culture methods such as USFDAs BAM or ISO procedures were used for the original isolation with all isolates confirmed by biochemical tests serotyping and species-specific gene detection based on PCR. RESULTS A total of 278 isolates consisting of 15 A. hydrophila 188 Salmonella spp. and 75 V. cholerae isolates were retrieved from a previous study. All isolates of A. hydrophila and Salmonella isolates were resistance to at least one antimicrobial with 26.7 and 72.3 of the isolates being multidrug resistant MDR respectively. All A. hydrophila isolates were resistant to ampicillin 100 followed by oxytetracycline 26.7 tetracycline 26.7 trimethoprim 26.7 and oxolinic acid 20.0. The predominant resistance genes in A. hydrophila were mcr-3 20.0 followed by 13.3 of isolates having floR qnrS sul1 sul2 and dfrA1. Salmonella isolates also exhibited a high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin 79.3 oxolinic acid 75.5 oxytetracycline 71.8 chloramphenicol 62.8 and florfenicol 55.3. The most common resistance genes in these Salmonella isolates were qnrS 65.4 tetA 64.9 bla TEM 63.8 and floR 55.9. All V. cholerae isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested while the most common resistance gene was sul1 12.0. One isolate of A. hydrophila was positive for int1 while all isolates of Salmonella and V. cholerae isolates were negative for integrons and int SXT. None of the bacterial isolates in this study were producing ESBL. The occurrence of mcr-3 20.0 in these isolates from tilapia aquaculture may signify a serious occupational and consumer health risk given that colistin is a last resort antimicrobial for treatment of Gram-negative bacteria infections. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this study on AMR bacteria in hybrid red tilapia suggest that aquaculture as practiced in Thailand can select for ubiquitous AMR pathogens mobile genetic elements and an emerging reservoir of mcr and colistin-resistant bacteria. Resistant and pathogenic bacteria such as resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline or MDR Salmonella circulating in aquaculture together highlight the public health concerns and foodborne risks of zoonotic pathogens in humans from cultured freshwater fish.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Hospital length of stay LOS is utilized to estimate resource utilization and quality of care. In burns the LOS estimation is 1day per percent total body surface area burn 1dayTBSA. Our purpose was to evaluate the 1dayTBSA burn rule and develop simple accurate formulas to predict LOS. METHODS The American Burn Association National Burn Repository NBR from 2000 to 2013 was utilized to collate data on patients 18 years. We divided 106543 records in half utilizing one set to develop a model training set and the other to test the model test set. We calculated the difference between observed and predicted LOS for all patients and then examined the effect of inhalation injury and age using a linear regression model containing TBSA age inhalation injury and all two-way interactions. We compared predictive performance of the linear regression model to the 1dayTBSA rule. Finally we developed and validated three simple formulas to more accurately predict LOS than the 1day TBSA rule. RESULTS LOS was significantly associated with patient age TBSA inhalation injury and all two-way interactions. For patients 40 years without inhalation injury the main effect of TBSA was 0.71. For each decade increase in age LOS increased by 0.74daysTBSA burn inhalation injury added 1.70days. LOS was highly variable among patients with similar burn size age and inhalation injury due to concomitant trauma complications and comorbidities. We developed 3 formulas to estimate patient LOS 1 inhalation injury present regardless of age 2 no inhalation injury and 40 years old 3 no inhalation injury and 40 years old. CONCLUSIONS Traditional LOS estimates of 1dayTBSA burn rule is biased underestimating LOS particularly for patients 40 years with inhalation injury. The following formulas applied at admission can accurately estimate hospital LOS improve prediction over 1dayTBSA and provide results comparable to complicated models.",

    "abstract": "Achromatopsia is a congenital autosomal recessively inherited disorder characterized by a lack of color discrimination low visual acuity 0.2 photophobia and nystagmus. Mutations in the genes for CNGA3 CNGB3 and GNAT2 have been associated with this disorder. Here we analyzed the spectrum and prevalence of CNGB3 gene mutations in a cohort of 341 independent patients with achromatopsia. In 163 patients CNGB3 mutations could be identified. A total of 105 achromats carried apparent homozygous mutations 44 were compound double heterozygotes and 14 patients had only a single mutant allele. The derived CNGB3 mutation spectrum comprises 28 different mutations including 12 nonsense mutations eight insertions andor deletions five putative splice site mutations and three missense mutations. Thus the majority of mutations in the CNGB3 gene result in significantly altered andor truncated polypeptides. Several mutations were found recurrently in particular a 1 bp deletion c.1148delC which accounts for over 70 of all CNGB3 mutant alleles. In conclusion mutations in the CNGB3 gene are responsible for approximately 50 of all patients with achromatopsia. This indicates that the CNGB3ACHM3 locus on chromosome 8q21 is the major locus for achromatopsia in patients of European origin or descent.",

To facilitate appropriate outcome assessment of this expanding population the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function NIH Toolbox was developed with particular attention paid to the cultural and linguistic needs of English- and Spanish-speaking HispanicsLatinos. METHODS A Cultural Working Group ensured that all included measures were appropriate for use with HispanicsLatinos in both English and Spanish. In addition a Spanish Language Working Group assessed all English-language NIH Toolbox measures for translatability. RESULTS Measures were translated following the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy FACIT translation methodology for instances where language interpretation could impact scores or a modified version thereof for more simplified translations. The Spanish versions of the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery language measures i.e. Picture Vocabulary Test Oral Reading Recognition Test were developed independently of their English counterparts. CONCLUSIONS The Spanish-language version of the NIH Toolbox provides a much-needed set of tools that can be selected as appropriate to complement existing protocols being conducted with the growing HispanicLatino population in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Cellobiohydrolases are crucial for cellulose breakdown but their efficiency on crystalline cellulose is hampered by limited access to single chain ends to initiate hydrolysis. As a result they depend on enzymes like lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases LPMOs which directly target the crystalline cellulose surface. This study investigated how LPMO pretreatment affected the productive binding capacity of a Trichoderma longibrachiatum cellobiohydrolase TlCBHI on crystalline cellulose by applying an amperometric cellobiose dehydrogenase biosensor. After the 24-hour of LPMO pretreatment the productive binding capacity of TlCBHI significantly increased in all reactions. However with a shorter 5-hour LPMO pretreatment minimal to no effect on productive binding capacity was observed. Of note all LPMO reactions were inactivated around this time point. This delayed LPMO effect suggests that the improved binding capacity for cellulases does not directly result from cellulose chain cleavage by LPMOs but rather from the cellulose decrystallization following the oxidative cleavage.",

The resulted fluorocarbon agents were then copolymerized with styrene. The structures of the vegetable oil based agents were characterized by FT-IR and NMR. By evaluating water contact angle and time of water disappearance on cotton fabrics as well as whiteness and breaking strength of cotton fabrics that were treated by these agents optimum fabric finishing conditions were explored. The cotton fabrics finished with the vegetable oil-based fluorocarbon agents showed excellent water repellency while other properties of the cotton fabrics declined to certain level. The linseed oil-based tetrafluoropropanol water repellent agent displayed the highest water repellency among all modified oils. All the treated fabrics exhibited good durability of water repellency.

Among preschool children average consumption from all food groups except vegetables was adequate. Most adults stated that their diet had improved since moving to the U.S. Dietary change was characterized by increased consumption of both basic and new foods especially among nonmigrants with considerable retention of traditional foods. There was no correlation between degree of change in traditional foods and degree of change in basic or new foods. Dietary change was thus a function of two or more independent trends. Different socioeconomic factors were related to the three components of dietary change. Bilingual children influenced adoption of new foods. Length of residence in the U.S. was not related to degree of dietary change. More migrants than nonmigrants held traditional beliefs proscribing certain foods during illness pregnancy or lactation. 1984 Taylor Francis Group LLC. All rights reserved.",

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 6 client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Medical records of dogs with a diagnosis of IC that were subsequently treated by thoracoscopic TDL and SPP and that had not undergone previous surgical treatment were reviewed. Thoracoscopic TDL was performed via a 3-portal technique with the patient in lateral recumbency. Subphrenic pericardiectomy was subsequently performed via a 3-portal technique with the patient in dorsal recumbency. If visualization during SPP was suboptimal 1-lung ventilation was used to ensure that pericardial resection was close to the phrenic nerves bilaterally but without risk of iatrogenic nerve injury. RESULTS All TDL and SPP procedures were completed successfully in a median surgical time of 177 minutes range 135 to 210 minutes. All 6 dogs showed resolution of clinical signs of chylothorax with no recurrence during a median follow-up period of 39 months range 19 to 60 months. Final postoperative thoracic radiographic evaluation was performed at a median of 14.5 months range 7 to 25 months. Complete resolution of pleural effusion occurred in all but 1 dog. In 1 dog a small volume of pleural effusion was persistent at a 7-month postoperative radiographic follow-up but was not associated with clinical signs and did not require thoracocentesis at any time during the dogs 25-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE From this limited series of patients results suggested that a minimally invasive TDL-SPP combined surgical technique for management of IC in dogs may be associated with a similarly successful outcome as has been reported for open surgical TDL-SPP.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to design and test a new high-resolution hybrid depth of interaction DOI detector for a dedicated breast PETCT scanner. Two detectors have been designed and built. The completed detectors are based on a 14 14 array of 1.5 1.5 20 mm3 unpolished lutetium orthosilicate scintillation crystals with each element coated in a 50 m layer of reflective material. The detector is read out from both ends using a position-sensitive photomultiplier tube PSPMT and a large active area 20 20 mm2 avalanche photodiode APD to enable acquisition of DOI information. Nuclear instrumentation modules were used to characterize the detectors performances in terms of timing intrinsic spatial resolution ISR and energy resolution as well as DOI resolution with a dual-ended readout configuration. Measurements with the APD were performed at a temperature of 10 C. All crystals were identified at all depths even though the signal amplitude from the PSPMT decreases with depth away from it. We measured a timing resolution of 2.4 ns and an average energy resolution of 19. The mean ISR was measured to be 1.2 mm for crystals in the central row of the array for detectors in the face-to-face position. Two off-center positions were measured corresponding to 26 and 51 oblique photon incidence and the mean ISR at these positions was 1.5 and 1.7 mm respectively. The average DOI resolution across all crystals and depths was measured to be 2.9 mm including the beam width of 0.6 mm. This detector design shows good promise as a high-resolution detector for a dedicated breast PETCT scanner.",

    "abstract": "Fifteen patients with toxic shock syndrome were seen in a 2-yr period at a university medical center. Five 33 patients had severe cardiorespiratory failure and underwent hemodynamic monitoring before and during infusion of dobutamine hydrochloride dobutamine. Three distinct hemodynamic stages were identified. Initially there was a hyperdynamic cardiovascular state with a high cardiac index 5.5 - 0.9 Lmin X m2 mean - SEM normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure 11.5 - 1.5 mm Hg and low mean blood pressure 66 - 5 mm Hg. The second stage decompensated revealed myocardial dysfunction with decreased left ventricular fractional shortening. Serial two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms performed on two patients showed left atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic diameters at the upper limits of normal. The mean blood pressure recorded for all five patients was essentially unchanged however cardiac index decreased to 3.1 - 0.4 Lmin X m2 and wedge pressure increased to 17.5 - 2.1 mm Hg. This decompensated stage responded to iv infusion of dobutamine by an increase in cardiac index to 5.4 - 0.5 Lmin X m2 a decrease in wedge pressure to 11.0 - 2.0 mm Hg and an increase in mean blood pressure to 100 - 10 mm Hg. During recovery echocardiograms returned to normal. All five patients developed severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. All had reversible ECG findings of sinus tachycardia diffuse loss of voltage flattened T waves and diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave changes. Our findings suggest a reversible toxic cardiomyopathy as the cause of cardiorespiratory failure in toxic shock syndrome. Our experience suggests inotropic support with dobutamine is beneficial in selected cases.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Trauma systems decrease injury-related mortality but not all systems have the same configuration. In some systems nearly all acute care hospitals participate to the extent that their resources allow inclusive systems whereas in others relatively few high-level centers participate exclusive systems. We postulate that inclusive systems assure that severely injured patients are more likely to be triaged to a level I or II regional trauma center and this greater degree of participation would lead to lower mortality. METHODS We used administrative discharge data for 2001 in 24 states with formal systems and we included all urgently hospitalized adults with an Injury Severity Scoreor16. We categorized states by trauma system configuration exclusive more inclusive most inclusive based on the proportion of all hospitals designated as a Level I through V trauma center 0-13 14-37 38-100 respectively. We compared the rates of triage to a regional trauma center and inpatient death in inclusive states relative to exclusive states while adjusting for patient- and state-level factors. RESULTS Out of 61496 patients 40706 66.2 were hospitalized at regional trauma centers. Inpatient mortality was 14.7. After adjusting for patient age primary payer status and system maturity the odds of triage to a regional trauma center were similar in inclusive and exclusive systems. After adjusting for primary payer status mechanism of injury and system maturity the odds of death were similar in more inclusive and exclusive systems odds ratio 0.93 95 confidence interval 0.80-1.08 but were significantly lower in the most inclusive systems odds ratio 0.77 95 confidence interval 0.60-0.99. CONCLUSIONS Severely injured trauma patients have greater inpatient survival in inclusive trauma systems even though they are no more likely to be hospitalized at a regional trauma center. Consideration should be given to continuing implementation of systems with an inclusive configuration especially in light of other theoretical benefits of these systems such as better dispersing of trauma care resources in the event of natural disasters or terrorist events.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Stagnant outcomes for adolescents and young adults AYAs 15-39 years of age with cancer are partly attributed to poor enrollment onto clinical trials. Initiatives have focused on increasing accrual but changes at the population-level are unknown. We examined patterns of clinical trial participation over time in AYA patients with cancer. PROCEDURE We utilized medical record data from AYAs in two population-based National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Studies identified through the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program. Among 3135 AYAs diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL Hodgkin lymphoma acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL and sarcoma we used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate patient and provider characteristics associated with clinical trial enrollment. Interaction terms evaluated variation in clinical trial enrollment across patient and provider characteristics by year of diagnosis. RESULTS From 2006 to 2012-2013 clinical trial participation increased from 14.8 to 17.9 P 0.01. Adjusting for patient and provider characteristics we found lower clinical trial enrollment among those who were older at diagnosis diagnosed with NHL vs ALL treated by adult hematologistoncologists only vs pediatric hematologistoncologists and of non-Hispanic Black raceethnicity vs non-Hispanic White P 0.05 for all. Interaction analyses indicate improved clinical trial enrollment from 2006 to 2012-2013 among young adults 25-29 years of age and the uninsured. CONCLUSIONS Although disparities in enrollment onto clinical trials remain for AYAs with cancer our study identified increasing overall clinical trial participation over time. Further we identify promising trends in enrollment uptake among AYAs 25-29 years of age and the uninsured.",

Recent studies show different patterns of gene expression related to different tissues and diseases and these patterns of gene expression are beginning to be used for diagnosis and treatment decisions in various types of lymphoid and solid malignancies. Because of obvious problems obtaining brain tissue progress in genomics of neurological diseases has been slow. To address this we demonstrated that different types of acute injury in rodent brain produced different patterns of gene expression in peripheral blood. These animal studies have now been extended to human studies. Two groups have shown that there are specific genomic profiles in the blood of patients after ischemic stroke that are highly sensitive and specific for predicting stroke. Other recent studies demonstrate specific genomic profiles in the blood of patients with Down syndrome neurofibromatosis tuberous sclerosis Huntington disease multiple sclerosis Tourette syndrome and others. In addition data demonstrate specific profiles of gene expression in the blood related to different drugs toxins and infections. Although all of these studies are still preliminary basic scientific endeavors they suggest that this approach will have clinical applications to neurological diseases in humans.",

By comparing a respiratory tract cell line HBE1 with primary tracheobronchial epithelial TBE cells we determined that DUOX2 was significantly expressed only in cell conditions that included all-trans retinoic acid ATRA. In HBE1 cells DUOX2 mRNA increased 6-fold after ATRA treatment. Similarly ATRA induced a 19-fold increase in DUOX2 mRNA expression in primary TBE cells with parallel increases in DUOX protein and DUOX-mediated H2O2 production as well. In addition DUOX2 induction by rhinovirus required the presence of ATRA. ATRA had no effect on DUOX1 expression for all the conditions studied.

    "abstract": "Metabolomics is increasingly being used in cancer biology for biomarker discovery and identification of potential novel therapeutic targets. However a systematic metabolomics study of multiple biofluids to determine their interrelationships and to describe their use as tumor proxies is lacking. Using a mouse xenograft model of kidney cancer characterized by subcapsular implantation of Caki-1 clear cell human kidney cancer cells we examined tissue serum and urine all obtained simultaneously at baseline urine and at or close to animal sacrifice urine tissue and plasma. Uniform metabolomics analysis of all three matrices was accomplished using gas chromatography- and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Of all the metabolites identified 267 in tissue 246 in serum and 267 in urine 89 were detected in all 3 matrices and the majority was altered in the same direction. Heat maps of individual metabolites showed that alterations in serum were more closely related to tissue than was urine. Two metabolites cinnamoylglycine and nicotinamide were concordantly and significantly when corrected for multiple testing altered in tissue and serum and cysteine-glutathione disulfide showed the highest change 232.4-fold in tissue of any metabolite. On the basis of these and other considerations three pathways were chosen for biologic validation of the metabolomic data resulting in potential therapeutic target identification. These data show that serum metabolomics analysis is a more accurate proxy for tissue changes than urine and that tryptophan degradation yielding anti-inflammatory metabolites is highly represented in renal cell carcinoma and support the concept that PPAR- antagonism may be a potential therapeutic approach for this disease.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Four-dimensional 4D computed tomography CT ventilation imaging is increasingly being used to calculate lung ventilation and implement functional-guided radiation therapy in clinical trials. There has been little exhaustive work evaluating which dose-function metrics should be used for treatment planning and plan evaluation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate which dose-function metrics best predict for radiation pneumonitis RP. METHODS AND MATERIALS Seventy lung cancer patients who underwent 4D CT imaging and pneumonitis grading were assessed. Pretreatment 4D CT scans of each patient were used to calculate ventilation images. We evaluated 3 types of dose-function metrics that combined the patients 4D CT ventilation image and treatment planning dose distribution 1 structure-based approaches 2 image-based approaches using the dose-function histogram and 3 nonlinear weighting schemes. Log-likelihood methods were used to generate normal tissue complication probability models predicting grade 3 or higher ie grade 3 pneumonitis for all dose-function schemes. The area under the curve AUC was used to assess the predictive power of the models. All techniques were compared with normal tissue complication probability models based on traditional total lung dose metrics. RESULTS The most predictive models were structure-based approaches that focused on the volume of functional lung receiving 20 Gy AUC 0.70. Probabilities of grade 3 RP of 20 and 10 correspond to V20 percentage of volume receiving 20 Gy to the functional subvolumes of 26.8 and 9.3 respectively. Imaging-based analysis with the dose-function histogram and nonlinear weighted ventilation values yielded AUCs of 0.66 and 0.67 respectively when we evaluated the percentage of functionality receiving 20 Gy. All dose-function metrics outperformed the traditional dose metrics mean lung dose AUC of 0.55. CONCLUSIONS A full range of dose-function metrics and functional thresholds was examined. The calculated AUC values for the most predictive functional models occupied a narrow range 0.66-0.70 and all showed notable improvements over AUC from traditional lung dose metrics 0.55. Identifying the combinations most predictive of grade 3 RP provides valuable data to inform the functional-guided radiation therapy process.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli endonuclease III EndoIII and MutY are DNA glycosylases that contain 4Fe4S clusters and that serve to maintain the integrity of the genome after oxidative stress. Electrochemical studies on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite HOPG revealed that DNA binding by EndoIII leads to a large negative shift in the midpoint potential of the cluster consistent with stabilization of the oxidized 4Fe4S3 form. However the smooth hydrophobic HOPG surface is nonideal for working with proteins in the absence of DNA. In this work we use thin film voltammetry on a pyrolytic graphite edge electrode to overcome these limitations. Improved adsorption leads to substantial signals for both EndoIII and MutY in the absence of DNA and a large negative potential shift is retained with DNA present. In contrast the EndoIII mutants E200K Y205H and K208E which provide electrostatic perturbations in the vicinity of the cluster all show DNA-free potentials within error of wild type similarly the presence of negatively charged poly-l-glutamate does not lead to a significant potential shift. Overall binding to the DNA polyanion is the dominant effect in tuning the redox potential of the 4Fe4S cluster helping to explain why all DNA-binding proteins with 4Fe4S clusters studied to date have similar DNA-bound potentials.",

    "abstract": "jatspBackground Numerous studies have demonstrated superior survival for adolescents and young adults AYA with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL treated with pediatric-inspired as opposed to adult-type front-line ALL regimens. However very little is known regarding the potential impact of therapeutic regimen type on late effects and subsequent neoplasms SN in AYA ALL survivors. Using population-based data we describe associations between subsequent medical conditionsSN sociodemographics and ALL therapies including regimen type pediatric versus adult in a large cohort of AYA ALL survivors.jatsp jatspMethods The California Cancer Registry CCR linked with California hospitalization data was used to evaluate socio-demographics therapies and subsequent medical conditions late effects amongst AYAs 15-39 years diagnosed with ALL in California between 1995-2012 surviving a minimum of three years from diagnosis. The CCR was used to identify front-line therapeutic regimen receipt of cranial irradiation CRI and SN hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT and late effects were captured through hospitalization data. Late effects were categorized as cardiac hypertensive disease coronary artery disease heart failure neurologic stroke seizure endocrine thyroid disease diabetes ovariantesticular dysfunction other metabolic diseases respiratory asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pulmonary fibrosis renal chronic kidney disease hemodialysis kidney transplant liver chronic liver disease pancreatitis cirrhosis liver transplant and avascular necrosis AVN. The 10-year cumulative incidence CMI of developing each late effectSN was estimated accounting for death as a competing risk. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses MVA examined the impact of sociodemographic factors and therapies pediatric vs adult ALL regimen HCT CRI on the occurrence of each late effectSN. Front-line regimen type pediatric vs adult was highly correlated with receipt of HCT Pamplt0.001 thus the impact of front-line regimen was evaluated in separate MVA for those who did and did not receive HCT.jatsp jatspResults Of the 1069 survivors of AYA ALL median follow-up 8.2 years 44 were 15-19 years at diagnosis 32 were 20-29 years 24 were 30-39 years 62 were male and 50 were Hispanic. Thirty-nine percent resided in the lowest neighborhood socio-economic status SES tertile and 35 had public or no insurance. The majority 60 received an adult-type front-line ALL regimen 19 received CRI and 28 underwent HCT. Twenty-four SN occurred thyroid head and neck and breast cancers were most common. The 10-year CMI of endocrine disease 29 and cardiac disease 17 were strikingly high AVN 10 respiratory disease 6 liver disease 7 seizurestroke 4 renal disease 3 and SN 3 occurred with descending incidence. Multivariable analyses including the entire patient cohort demonstrated that public or no insurance vs privatemilitary insurance and receipt of HCT were independently associated with both late effects across organ systems and SN Table 1A. Raceethnicity sex and neighborhood SES were not associated with late effectsSN. In MVA limited to the 766 AYAs who did not receive HCT we continued to find a significant association between public and no insurance and all late effects including SN. Front-line regimen type was not significantly associated with any of the late effect categories nor was CRI Table 1B. Among the 303 AYAs who received HCT lower neighborhood SES was associated with higher risk of all late effectsSN considered.jatsp jatspConclusions This large population-based analysis is amongst the first to describe late effects and SN in survivors of AYA ALL. Public or no health insurance and receipt of HCT were independently associated with the development of late effects across organ systems and SN while front-line regimen type adult vs. pediatric among non-transplanted AYAs was not. The strong association between insurance type and late effects suggests that AYAs with public or no insurance may have reduced access to survivorship care following completion of ALL therapy. While additional follow-up is necessary to discern the full burden of late effects in survivors of AYA ALL these findings suggest significant ongoing healthcare needs in this cancer survivor population.jatsp jatsp jatssec jatstitleDisclosuresjatstitle jatspMuffly KITE Consultancy Pfizer Consultancy Adaptive Research Funding.jatsp jatssec",

    "abstract": "Death from cocaine intoxication results from one or more of the multiple mechanisms including seizures cardiovascular collapse or apnea. In the free-moving rat model continuous seizures are a major cause of death. To study other mechanisms of death unrelated to seizures in this model we suppressed lethal seizures with diazepam DZP and investigated the effect of several pharmacological agents. Rats were pretreated with vehicle alone diazepam 5 mgkg alone or a combination of DZP plus either nifedipine NIFD 2 mgkg propranolol PROP 10 mgkg or prazosin PRAZ 5 mgkg. Five minutes after pretreatment all animals received cocaine 100 mgkg. Each test group consisted of 15 animals and all agents were given IP. Two animals in each group had cortical electrodes implanted. Animals that received vehicle followed by cocaine had 100 incidence of seizures and death. Those rats that received DZP alone followed by cocaine had no seizures and 53 death. Rats that received DZP plus NIFD or DZP plus PROP had suppression of seizures but no significant change in the incidence of death. The group that received DZP and PRAZ followed by cocaine had no seizures and 13 incidence of death p 0.001. Electroencephalogram recordings showed cortical electrical spike activity or spike-and-wave afterdischarges in all animals clinically observed to have seizures. In the absence of clinical seizure activity no significant cortical spike activity was noted. It is concluded that animals protected from seizures with diazepam can still have nonseizure deaths after high-dose cocaine. The incidence of death in these animals is not reduced with nifedipine or propranolol pretreatment but is reduced with prazosin pretreatment.",

All four compounds have endothermic enthalpies of formation from binary oxides AO2 and B2O5 indicating that these modulated phases are entropy stabilized. The unfavorable energetics of formation are counterbalanced by large configurational entropy arising from cation disorder. The calculated configurational entropy per formula unit for A6B2O17 is 4.50R JmolK which is 2.8 times higher than the maximum configurational entropy value of 1.61R for an equimolar five cation containing high entropy oxide.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDOBJECTIVE The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program NSQIP has demonstrated quality improvement in the VA and pilot study of 14 academic institutions. The objective was to show that American College of Surgeons ACS-NSQIP helps all enrolled hospitals. METHODS ACS-NSQIP data was used to evaluate improvement in hospitals longitudinally over 3 years 2005-2007. Improvement was defined as reduction in risk-adjusted ObservedExpected OE ratios between periods with risk adjustment held constant. Multivariable logistic regression-based adjustment was performed and included indicators for procedure groups. Additionally morbidity counts were modeled using a negative binomial model to estimate the number of avoided complications. RESULTS Multiple perspectives reflected improvement over time. In the analysis of 118 hospitals 2006-2007 66 of hospitals improved risk-adjusted mortality mean OE improvement 0.174 P 0.05 and 82 improved risk adjusted complication rates mean improvement 0.114 P 0.05. Correlations between starting OE and improvement 0.834 for mortality 0.652 for morbidity as well as relative risk revealed that initially worse-performing hospitals had more likelihood of improvement. Nonetheless well-performing hospitals also improved. Modeling morbidity counts 183 hospitals 2007 avoided 9598 potential complications 52hospital. Due to sampling this may represent only 1 of 5 to 1of 10 of the true total. Improvement reflected aggregate performance across all types of hospitals academiccommunity urbanrural. Changes in patient risk over time had important contributions to the effect. CONCLUSIONS ACS-NSQIP indicates that surgical outcomes improve across all participating hospitals in the private sector. Improvement is reflected for both poor- and well-performing facilities. NSQIP hospitals appear to be avoiding substantial numbers of complications- improving care and reducing costs. Changes in risk over time merit further study.",

    "abstract": "In CASP14 39 research groups submitted more than 2500 3D models on 22 protein complexes. In general the community performed well in predicting the fold of the assemblies for 80 of the targets although it faced significant challenges in reproducing the native contacts. This is especially the case for the complexes without whole-assembly templates. The leading predictor BAKER-experimental used a methodology combining classical techniques template-based modeling protein docking with deep learning-based contact predictions and a fold-and-dock approach. The Venclovas team achieved the runner-up position with template-based modeling and docking. By analyzing the target interfaces we showed that the complexes with depleted charged contacts or dominating hydrophobic interactions were the most challenging ones to predict. We also demonstrated that if AlphaFold2 predictions were at hand the interface prediction challenge could be alleviated for most of the targets. All in all it is evident that new approaches are needed for the accurate prediction of assemblies which undoubtedly will expand on the significant improvements in the tertiary structure prediction field.",

Without this knowledge health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations Asian and Pacific Islander community members and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds Fucus distichus F. spiralis and Nereocystis luetkeana from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples and 94 persistent organic pollutants POPs i.e. 40 PCBs 15 PBDEs 17 PCDDFs and 22 organochlorine pesticides and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits Cd total Hg Pb benzoapyrene BaP and PCBs or are of regional interest total As. USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As and to be conservative we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals such as contaminants of emerging concern e.g. PFAS pharmaceuticals and personal care products should also be considered. Additionally although we focused on toxicological aspects there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Many developed countries are beginning to see the public reporting of comparative information about the quality of health care as an important way of improving accountability stimulating quality improvement and empowering members of the public. The production and dissemination of quality reports is particularly high on the policy agenda in the US and the UK and there is now a considerable amount of experience and evidence from these countries to guide the process. Over the last decade there has been a lively debate about the balance between the advantages and problems of public reporting but most commentators now believe it is time to cease asking whether we should disseminate information and start asking how it can be done most effectively. PURPOSE To recommend ways of helping policy makers and practitioners to maximize the impact of quality reports and minimize the unintended consequences. Recommended strategies. We make recommendations about the importance of understanding the macro- and micro--environment within which public reporting takes place of actively addressing the unintended consequences of public reporting of incentivizing the response to the data and of engaging the public and media. The effectiveness of the different strategies on their own or in combination is likely to be determined by the environment within which reporting takes place. CONCLUSIONS It is not desirable to look for a common fix applicable to all organizations or transferable across all international boundaries. However in this paper we describe lessons that we think are common to all countries attempting to produce and disseminate health care quality reports.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies how close random graphs are typically to their expectations. We interpret this question through the concentration of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices in the spectral norm. We study inhomogeneous Erds-Rnyi random graphs on n vertices where edges form independently and possibly with different probabilities pij. Sparse random graphs whose expected degrees are olog n fail to concentrate the obstruction is caused by vertices with abnormally high and low degrees. We show that concentration can be restored if we regularize the degrees of such vertices and one can do this in various ways. As an example let us reweight or remove enough edges to make all degrees bounded above by Od where d max npij. Then we show that the resulting adjacency matrix A concentrates with the optimal rate AEA Od. Similarly if we make all degrees bounded below by d by adding weight d n to all edges then the resulting Laplacian concentrates with the optimal rate LA LEA O1d. Our approach is based on Grothendieck-Pietsch factorization using which we construct a new decomposition of random graphs. We illustrate the concentration results with an application to the community detection problem in the analysis of networks. 2017 Wiley Periodicals Inc. Random Struct. Alg. 51 538561 2017.",

    "abstract": "The presence of well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts at the end of therapy for rhabdomyosarcoma has been noted. This study was undertaken to investigate the therapeutic implications of the presence of well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts at the end of therapy for pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma. Six patients with pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma bladder-prostate 4 vulvovaginal 2 with disease diagnosed between the years 1974 and 1992 were sequentially investigated by cystoscopic or vaginoscopic examination and biopsy during and after completing therapy. All six patients received treatment according to prevailing therapeutic protocols. Biopsy material from all six patients at the end of therapy documented the presence of well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts. Repeated biopsies demonstrated the presence of rhabdomyoblasts however they appeared to decrease in number with time. Mitotic activity was not observed in the biopsy materials obtained. All six patients are alive without evidence of disease from 37 to 233 months after therapy ended. The presence of well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts at the end of therapy for pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma is a common finding. The biologic nature of these well-differentiated rhabdomyoblasts is not completely known but they do not appear to connote the persistent presence of malignant disease and are not an indication for the continuation of therapy.",

OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between PCSK9 Lpa level apoa size age and ethnicityrace. DESIGN Cross-sectional. SETTING General population. PARTICIPANTS Healthy African Americans and Caucasians n 267 age range 6 to 74 years. INTERVENTIONS None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES PCSK9 levels apoa isoform and LPA allele sizes and isoform-specific Lpa levels. RESULTS Plasma PCSK9 levels were significantly higher in African Americans vs Caucasians in females vs males and in adults vs children. PCSK9 levels were not associated with total plasma Lpa levels either in all participants or in ethnicity-specific analyses. However PCSK9 levels were significantly positively associated with isoform-specific Lpa levels carried by the larger apoa size in all participants r 0.139 P 0.0361. In ethnicityrace analyses a significant association was seen for African Americans r 0.268 P 0.0199 but not for Caucasians. In contrast there were no significant associations of PCSK9 with isoform-specific Lpa levels for the smaller apoa sizes in all participants nor in ethnic-specific analyses. Furthermore heritability h2 analyses revealed a significant heritability for PCSK9 level in both ethnic groups with a higher estimate in Caucasians than in African Americans 47 vs 22 respectively. CONCLUSIONS Among African Americans but not Caucasians PCSK9 levels were associated with isoform-specific Lpa levels carried on larger but not smaller apoa sizes. The findings illustrate a diverging relationship of PCSK9 with isoform-specific Lpa levels across ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between a consumer preference data set and a corresponding sensory profile on eight cooked wheat noodles with different formulas was examined using several multivariate techniques. Individual consumer hedonic responses 100 noodlepasta consumers and eight appearance and texture sensory attributes were collected. The consumer preference data were treated in two different ways mean values averaged across all consumers or principal components extracted from individual responses. The mean preference scores were submitted to both principal component stepwise regression and partial least squares regression PLS1 whereas the summarized major preference components were subjected to canonical correlation analysis as well as partial least squares regression PLS2. The results suggested that in case of complex consumer data using mean value can only capture the most manifest trends in consumer preference patterns while studying individual responses and by further categorizing major preference patterns provide an opportunity to discover the hidden information that are masked by data averaging. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
