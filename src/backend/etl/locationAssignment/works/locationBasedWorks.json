    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been mainly investigated as a potential target against cardiometabolic disease, but it has also been linked to cancer-related outcomes. Although preclinical data support that BAT and the thermogenic adipocytes in white adipose tissue may play an adverse role in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia, results from studies in patients have reported inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to examine the interrelationship between presence of detectable BAT, changes in body weight, and cachexia in patients with cancer. We hypothesized that evidence of BAT at cancer diagnosis would be associated with greater weight loss and risk of cancer cachexia up to a year after cancer diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in treatment-naïve patients with detectable BAT (BAT+, n = 57) and without evidence of BAT (BAT-, n = 73) on 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET-CT) imaging performed for cancer staging (2004-2020). Patients' clinical, demographic, and anthropometric characteristics were extracted from their electronic medical record for up to a year after diagnosis. The two groups were a priori matched for demographic, anthropometric, and disease-related characteristics at diagnosis, as well as for season and outdoor temperature on the day of the PET-CT scan. Cancer cachexia was defined as weight loss greater than 5 % or 2 % if body mass index was lower than 20 kg/m2. Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate the relative risk (RR) for developing cancer cachexia over the 1-year follow-up among BAT+ compared to BAT- patients. RESULTS: The BAT+ group experienced a lower magnitude of weight loss compared with the BAT- group during the 1-year follow-up (p = 0.014 for interaction between BAT status and time). The risk for cancer cachexia was 44 % lower in the BAT+ than the BAT- group, adjusted for age, sex, outdoor temperature on the day of the 18F-FDG-PET-CT imaging, cancer site and stage (RR: 0.56, 95 % CI: 0.32 to 0.97). CONCLUSION: Contrary to our original hypothesis, evidence of BAT assessed by 18F-FDG-PET-CT imaging at cancer diagnosis was associated with greater body weight maintenance and lower risk for developing cancer cachexia up to one year after diagnosis. Larger, prospective studies and mechanistic experiments are needed to expand and identify the causal factors of our observations.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to characterize the diagnostic accuracy indices for nodal (N)-staging with [18F]FDG Total-Body (TB) and short-axial field-of-view (SAFOV) PET/CT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients referred for staging or restaging. METHODS: In this prospective single center cross-over head-to-head comparative study 48 patients underwent [18F]FDG TB and SAFOV PET/CT on the same day. In total 700 lymph node levels (1R/L, 2R/L, 3a/p, 4R/L, 5, 6, 7, 8R/L, 9R/L, 10-14R/L) of 28 patients could be correlated to a composite reference standard (histopathological correlation, imaging after localized or systemic treatment), which allowed determination of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false negative (FN) lesions. Lymph nodes were characterized semi-quantitatively by maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) leading to threshold for each scanner. RESULTS: TB and SAFOV PET/CT showed high diagnostic accuracy indices for patient-based N-staging. Sensitivity and specificity were 86.0% (CI: 77.0-95.0%) and 98.3% (CI: 97.3-99.3%) for TB; 77.2% (CI: 66.3-88.1%) and 97.4% (CI: 96.1-98.6%) for SAFOV PET. Positive predictive value was higher for TB (81.7%, CI: 71.9-91.5%) compared to SAFOV PET (72.1%, CI: 60.9-83.4%). However, this finding was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Negative predictive values for TB (98.6%, CI: 97.9-99.6%) and SAFOV PET/CT (98.0%, CI: 96.9-99.1%) were comparable. Overall, NSCLC N-staging was affected in six cases on SAFOV and only in one case on TB PET/CT. Semi-quantitative analysis revealed a threshold of SUVmax 3.0 to detect TP lesions on both scanners. However, TBR, MTV and TLG thresholds were lower on TB compared to SAFOV PET (TBR: 1.2 vs. 1.7, MTV: 0.5 ml vs. 1.0 ml and TLG: 1.0 ml vs. 3.0 ml). CONCLUSION: TB and SAFOV PET/CT showed high diagnostic accuracy indices for N-staging in NSCLC patients. Sensitivity and PPV on TB PET/CT were slightly higher, compared to SAFOV PET/CT without statistical significance. However, TB PET/CT showed lower rate of incorrect N-staging and lower semi-quantitative thresholds for the detection positive mediastinal lymph nodes. Therefore, TB PET/CT might be advantageous in detecting small and low [18F]FDG-avidity mediastinal lymph node metastases in NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dual-energy (DE) CT enables material decomposition by using two different x-ray energies and may be combined with PET for improved multimodality imaging. However, this increases radiation dose and may require a hardware upgrade due to the added second x-ray CT scan. The recently proposed PET-enabled DECT method allows dual-energy imaging using a conventional PET/CT scanner without the need to change scanner hardware or increase radiation exposure. Here we demonstrate the first-time physical phantom and patient data evaluation of this method. METHODS: The PET-enabled DECT method reconstructs a gamma-ray CT (gCT) image at 511 keV from the time-of-flight PET data with the maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) approach and then combines this image with the low-energy x-ray CT images to form a dual-energy image pair for material decomposition. To improve the image quality of gCT, a kernel MLAA method was developed using the x-ray CT as a priori information. Here we developed a general open-source implementation for gCT reconstruction and used this implementation for the first real data validation using both physical phantom study and human-subject study. Results from PET-enabled DECT were compared using x-ray DECT as the reference. Further, we applied the PET-enabled DECT method in another patient study to evaluate bone lesions. RESULTS: Compared to the standard MLAA, results from the kernel MLAA showed significantly improved image quality. PET-enabled DECT with the kernel MLAA was able to generate fractional images that were comparable to the x-ray DECT, with high correlation coefficients for both the phantom study and human subject study (R > 0.99). The application study also indicates that PET-enabled DECT has potential to characterize bone lesions. CONCLUSION: Results from this study have demonstrated the feasibility of this PET-enabled method for CT imaging and material decomposition. PET-enabled DECT shows promise to provide comparable results to x-ray DECT.",

However, current methods evaluate the blood-brain barrier mainly as a structural barrier. Here we developed a non-invasive positron emission tomography method in humans to measure the blood-brain barrier permeability of molecular radiotracers that cross the blood-brain barrier through its molecule-specific transport mechanism. Our method uses high-temporal resolution dynamic imaging and kinetic modeling for multiparametric imaging and quantification of the blood-brain barrier permeability-surface area product of molecular radiotracers. We show, in humans, our method can resolve blood-brain barrier permeability across three radiotracers and demonstrate its utility in studying brain aging and brain-body interactions in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver inflammation. Our method opens new directions to effectively study the molecular permeability of the human blood-brain barrier in vivo using the large catalogue of available molecular positron emission tomography tracers.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Scholars have increasingly recognized the crucial role that empathy plays as informal caregivers provide unpaid care to their older family and friends (i.e., care recipients). Yet, the existing literature exhibits substantial variability in study approaches and results, which limits the extent to which this literature can inform interventions intended to benefit informal caregivers. We sought to address this critical gap by synthesizing research that examined how caregivers' and care recipients' empathy were associated with caregivers' psychological health. METHODS: We conducted a literature search using PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), EMBASE, and Scopus databases and systematically reviewed 21 peer-reviewed studies that were eligible for the current study. We utilized a multilevel random-effects approach and meta-analyzed 17 studies focused on caregivers' negative psychological outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, burden, burnout, stress). RESULTS: We observed small, non-significant associations linking caregivers' emotional and cognitive empathy to their negative psychological outcomes. Yet, there were moderate, significant associations between greater emotional and cognitive empathy in care recipients and less negative psychological outcomes in caregivers. We also ran sensitivity tests for different aspects of emotional and cognitive empathy. DISCUSSION: This review reveals considerable heterogeneity in extant research but still offers robust evidence linking care recipients' empathy to caregivers' psychological health. Findings highlight the importance of engaging care recipients in interventions targeting caregivers and call for more consistent and nuanced investigations of empathy in caregiving.",

    "issued": "2024-06",
    "abstract": "Background: The Arab Region accounts for most of the world's refugees. Despite being dispersed across the globe, most of these refugees are internally displaced within the region. A growing body of research argues that Western biomedical frameworks for conceptualizing, diagnosing, and treating trauma may not be suitable for non-Western and trauma caused by political violence inflicted on entire populations over time. The cultural and socio/political contexts of trauma are increasingly recognized as key to understanding trauma-related distress. Arab trauma research has emerged in the past 30 years. Nevertheless, the results are not systematically consolidated. Aim: This review aims to identify and map knowledge production in the Arab Region that is challenging Western notions of trauma experienced by Arab refugees in the region and attempts to explore the contours of a more culturally congruent conceptualization of trauma. Method: Following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR), we conducted a scoping review. Peer-reviewed, empirical literature from 1990 to 2023 was searched in eight English and three Arabic databases. Results and implications: Out of 2654 articles only ten were included. Included publications explored two main areas: conceptualization of trauma in Arab samples and addressing the subject of traumatization. The articles highlighted the limitations of using the PTSD model to diagnose and treat Arab refugees' traumatic stress and the importance of contextual, structural, and cultural factors in distress conceptualization. The articles provide research, clinical, and policy implications addressing adoption of social justice frameworks, development of contextually relevant trauma models, clinical investigations and assessment of symptoms and idioms.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An aging United States population profoundly impacts healthcare from both a medical and financial standpoint, especially with an increase in related procedures such as Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program and Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Program incentivize hospitals to decrease post-operative readmissions by correlating reimbursements with smoother care transitions, thereby decreasing hospital burden and improving quantifiable patient outcomes. Many studies have proposed predictive models built upon risk factors for predicting 30-day THA readmissions. QUESTIONS: (1) Are there validated statistical models that predict 30-day readmissions for THA patients when appraised with a standards-based, reliable assessment tool?. (2) Which evidence-based factors are significant and have support across models for predicting risk of 30-day readmissions post-THA? METHODS: Five major electronic databases were searched to identify studies that examined correlations between post-THA readmission and risk factors using multivariate models. We rigorously applied the PRISMA methodology and TRIPOD criteria for assessment of the prognostic studies. RESULTS: We found 26 studies that offered predictive models, of which two presented models tested with validation cohorts. In addition to the many factors grouped into demographic, administrative, and clinical categories, bleeding disorder, higher ASA status, discharge disposition, and functional status appeared to have broad and significant support across the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of recent predictive models establishing risk factors for 30-day THA readmissions against the current standard could be improved. Aside from building better performing models, more work is needed to follow the thorough process of undergoing calibration, external validation, and integration with existing EHR systems for pursuing their use in clinical settings. There are several risk factors that are significant in multiple models; these factors should be closely examined clinically and leveraged in future risk modeling efforts.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of county-level social vulnerability on patients' decision to refuse recommended surgical treatment. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis conducted on HNSCC cases documented in the latest available SEER databases from 2000 to 2020; various demographic, including county of residence, and disease-related variables were collected. CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was assigned based on patients' county of residence, and patients were subsequently categorized into four SVI quartiles. Pearson chi-square tests and binomial logistic regression was conducted to determine the impact of variables on patients' refusal of surgical treatment. RESULTS: Among 83,184 patients, 2.6% (2,165) refused surgical intervention recommended by their physician as part of treatment. Social vulnerability (higher SVI), male sex, older age, more advanced disease stage, belonging to non-Hispanic Black or Native Hawaiian/Asian Pacific Islander Race and Origin, and single marital status were associated with higher likelihood of refusing surgery. CONCLUSION: SVI is a significant factor in the refusal of recommended surgical treatment in HNSCC patients. Advanced disease stages and social vulnerability appear to interplay, influencing treatment decisions. Culturally competent care and support for socially vulnerable patients may mitigate disparities in treatment acceptance, potentially improving survival outcomes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, the systemic loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, is prevalent and particularly detrimental to head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Cancer-associated sarcopenia involves complex mechanisms of poor nutrition and inflammation, highlighting the necessity for preoperative identification of these high-risk patients. METHODS: A multi-site retrospective chart review (2016-2021) was performed on HNC patients undergoing total laryngectomy with or without reconstruction. Preoperative lab values were utilized to calculate markers of sarcopenia including systemic immune inflammation index (SII), nutrition-related index (NRI), geriatric NRI (GNRI), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Comparative analyses, ROC curves, and logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate the predictive value of these indices on 30-day postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: In a cohort of 520 laryngectomy patients (75.8% salvage), postoperative fistula, major complication, and prolonged PO intake > 30 days were recorded in 22.7%, 25.4%, and 26.2% of patients, respectively. NLR was higher in patients with prolonged PO intake, while the NRI/GNRI was lower in patients with delayed PO intake. There were no significant differences in patient indices with or without fistula and major complications. All nutritional indices on ROC curves had areas under the curve < 0.600. After adjusting for confounding on multivariate logistic regression, the NLR (OR = 0.95) and SII (OR = 0.98) were predictive of major postoperative complications, while the NRI/GNRI (OR = 0.96) was predictive of delayed PO intake. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional indices may be valuable to predict adverse postoperative laryngectomy outcomes. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.",

Predicting high-risk OL remains a challenge. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are thought to be of paramount importance to improve outcomes. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov data for updates in the clinical management of OL from 2015 to current. RESULTS: Recent publication of large cohorts of patients with OL aids in counseling patients regarding risk of malignant transformation. Management for OL includes surveillance, excision, and laser surgery, as well as local and systemic approaches to chemoprevention. Several new entities show promise regarding candidate biomarkers, chemoprevention agents, and diagnostic adjuncts, though all require further validation. CONCLUSION: This update serves to further inform clinical management of OL and provide impetus for future investigations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00099021, NCT00951379, NCT05727761, NCT05727761.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a major consequence of head and neck cancer (HNC), often leading to decreased skeletal muscle mass and impacting survival. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of sarcopenia, as defined by skeletal muscle index (SMI), on survival in patients with HNC. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients with HNC treated with surgery and/or radiation at a single tertiary care institute. All had pre-treatment imaging available for skeletal muscle index (SMI) measurements, and SMI was calculated at the level of the 3rd cervical vertebra. Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI < 41 cm2/m2 in females and as <43 cm2/m2 in underweight or healthy weight males. Sarcopenia was defined as <53 cm2/m2 in overweight or obese males. Chi-square analysis was performed to compare recurrence and survival rates, and survival analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meir curve. RESULTS: Hundred and twelve patients with HNC were evaluated, 84 men and 28 women with an average age of 60.9 years. Tumors were primarily located in the oral cavity (24.1%) and oropharynx (42%). The majority (69.6%) underwent surgery. Mean body mass index prior to treatment was 28. Sixty-nine patients (61.6%) in our cohort had low SMI. Mean follow-up was 3.9 ± 2.2 years. Recurrence rate was 26% in those with low SMI versus 2% in those without. Patients with low SMI were more likely to have a recurrence (p = 0.02). Overall survival was 72.5% in those with low SMI and 81% in those with normal SMI (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Defining sarcopenia as a low skeletal muscle index at the third cervical vertebra is clinically relevant. This study demonstrates that low SMI at this level, and thus sarcopenia, was strongly associated with higher rates of recurrence.",

    "issued": "2024-04",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) without evidence of nodal metastasis (cN0) on pre-operative evaluation, there are no clear guidelines who should undergo elective neck dissection (END) versus clinical surveillance. OBJECTIVE: To identify CT imaging characteristics of sub-centimeter lymph nodes that would help predict the likelihood of nodal metastases on pathology. METHODS: Retrospective review of cN0 OCSCC patients at a tertiary academic medical center was performed. Inclusion criteria included elective neck dissection, pre-operative CT imaging and presence of metastatic disease within lymph nodes. Control group consisted of patients without nodal metastases on pathology. CT features that were evaluated included asymmetric size, disrupted fatty hilum, asymmetric number, presence of cortical nodule, cortical nodule size, and round/oval shape. We evaluated the associations between CT LN features and the presence of metastases using multi-level mixed-effects logistic regression models. Model evaluation was performed using 5-fold cross-validation. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. RESULTS: 26 patients in each study and control groups were included. Three-level mixed-effects logistic regression models indicated round/oval shape (OR = 1.39, p = .01), asymmetric number (OR = 7.20, p = .005), and disrupted fatty hilum (OR = 3.31, p = .04) to be independently predictive in a 3-variable model with sensitivity = 38.0%, specificity = 92.0%, and PPV = 93.8%. CONCLUSIONS: In cN0 OCSCC patients undergoing END, round/oval shape, asymmetric number, and disrupted fatty hilum of lymph nodes on pre-operative CT imaging are novel and highly predictive of occult nodal disease.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis despite surgery and chemoradiation. The visual sequelae of glioblastoma have not been well characterized. This study assessed visual outcomes in glioblastoma patients through neuro-ophthalmic exams, imaging of the retinal microstructures/microvasculature, and perimetry. METHODS: A total of 19 patients with glioblastoma (9 male, 10 female, average age at diagnosis 69 years) were enrolled. Tumor characteristic, neuro-ophthalmic exam data, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT-Angiography data of all patient eyes were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and a Machine Learning algorithm. RESULTS: Best-corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/20 - 20/50. Occipital tumors showed worse visual fields than frontal tumors (mean deviation -14.9 and -0.23, respectively, p < 0.0001). Those with overall survival (OS)< 15 months demonstrated thinner retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell complex (p < 0.0001) and enlarged foveal avascular zone starting from 4 months post-diagnosis (p = 0.006). There was no significant difference between eyes ipsilateral and contralateral to radiation fields (average doses were 1370 cGy and 1180 cGy, respectively, p = 0.42). A machine learning algorithm using retinal microstructure and visual fields predicted patients with long (≥15 months) progression-free and overall survival with 78 % accuracy. CONCLUSION: Glioblastoma patients frequently present with visual field defects despite normal visual acuity. Patients with poor survival duration demonstrated significant retinal thinning and decreased microvascular density. A machine learning algorithm predicted survival though further validation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "A putative molecular subtype of IDH-wildtype diffuse glioma with recurrent MAPK pathway alterations has recently been reported. By dimensionality reduction analysis of genome-wide methylation profiling, these tumors form a distinct methylation cluster of gliomas. Characterization of 47 tumors from 45 patients reveals that these gliomas are predominantly supratentorial in young adults, are highly infiltrative, and harbor mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations with high rates of CDKN2A/2B deletion, PDGFRA amplification, MYCN amplification, NF1 variants, and BRAF alterations. The tumors' epigenetics are distinct from other adult and pediatric gliomas in the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The histology of the gliomas most often demonstrates high-grade astrocytic features, but can be variable from tumor to tumor, as well as fall into a spectrum of histologic grades. Outcomes show considerable variability based on histologic grade and molecular features, supporting grading within this group of tumors to ensure optimal care choices on an individual patient basis. These unifying epigenetic, sequencing, and infiltrative astrocytic features allow the tumors to be considered diffuse astrocytoma, adolescent, and young adult-type, with MAPK alterations (DAYA).",

    "abstract": "The development of novel therapeutics in neuro-oncology faces significant challenges, often marked by high costs and low success rates. Despite advances in molecular biology and genomics, targeted therapies have had limited impact on improving patient outcomes in brain tumors, particularly gliomas, due to the complex, multigenic nature of these malignancies. While significant efforts have been made to design drugs that target specific signaling pathways and genetic mutations, the clinical success of these rational approaches remains sparse. This review critically examines the landscape of neuro-oncology drug discovery, highlighting instances where serendipity has led to significant breakthroughs, such as the unexpected efficacy of repurposed drugs and off-target effects that proved beneficial. By exploring historical and contemporary cases, we underscore the role of chance in the discovery of impactful therapies, arguing that embracing serendipity alongside rational drug design may enhance future success in neuro-oncology drug development.",

Beyond primary psychotic illness (e.g., schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder), some of these patients will develop psychotic disorder due to a complex interplay of genetics, anatomical variations, traumatic brain injury (TBI), environment, substance use, and/or other causes. A small subset of patients will develop psychotic disorder due to a structural anatomic lesion, such as a CNS tumor. Here we present a 35-year-old male with worsening auditory hallucinations after surgical resection and radiation of a right temporal lobe astrocytoma in the setting of co-morbid methamphetamine usage. This case report helps illustrate how a neuroimaging work-up is important for the first incidence of psychotic disorder and how a tumor can produce a psychotic disorder that persists after oncologic treatment. This paper adds to the literature on the presentation and treatment of post-resection tumor-induced psychotic disorder.",

    "abstract": "Ductal carcinoma in situ is a diverse disease in which only 50% of lesions progress to invasive carcinoma, but unfortunately, all patients receive similar treatment recommendations independent of the disease variability. De-escalation is the philosophy that treatment for this disease should be differentiated based on the likelihood of future progression and recurrence. Four surgical trials are looking at the possibility of removing surgical intervention, the current mainstay of treatment, from the algorithm. Molecular assays have been developed to help differentiate the risk of an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and potentially guide the postsurgical utility of radiation therapy. Primary endocrine therapy is also being explored as an alternative to standard local therapy. Ductal carcinoma in situ therapy is a very complicated algorithm that should be discussed and treated through shared decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The Cadambe-Mazumdar bound gives a necessary condition for a code to have a certain locality in case of a single erasure in terms of length, dimension, and Hamming distance of the code and of certain shortened codes. The bound has been generalized by Rawat, Mazumdar, and Vishwanath to recover multiple erasures in a cooperative repair scenario. In this paper, the generalized Hamming weights of the code and its shortened codes, which include the Hamming distance as one component, are incorporated to obtain bounds on locality to recover a single erasure or multiple erasures cooperatively. The new bounds give sharper necessary conditions than existing bounds.",

    "abstract": "We present the construction of interleaving arrays for correcting clusters as well as diffuse bursts of insertion or deletion errors in constrained data. In this construction, a constrained information sequence is systematically encoded by computing a small number of parity checks and inserting markers such that the resulting code word is also constrained. Insertions and deletions lead to a shift between successive markers, which can thus be detected and recovered using the parity checks. In this letter, as an example, the scheme is developed for Manchester-encoded information sequences.",
