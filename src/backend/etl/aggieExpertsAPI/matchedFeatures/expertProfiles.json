Here we studied whether expression of sEH protein is altered in the postmortem samples (parietal cortex, and liver) from patients with major psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Protein expression of sEH in the parietal cortex and liver from control, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ) groups was measured. RESULTS: Levels of sEH in the parietal cortex and liver from MDD, BD, and SZ groups were significantly higher than the control group. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between sEH protein in the parietal cortex and sEH protein the liver in all groups. LIMITATIONS: The small number in each group may limit our interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the increased expression of sEH in the brain and liver might play a role in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, suggesting a role of brain - liver axis in major psychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "AIM: Although opioids have been used as treatment of neuropathic pain, opioids have abuse potential in humans. Since soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids plays a key role in the pain, sEH inhibitors would be promising new therapeutic drugs for neuropathic pain. In this study, we examined the effect of the sEH inhibitor TPPU on rewarding effects in mice using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. METHODS: The rewarding effects of morphine (10 mg/kg) and TPPU (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) in mice were examined using CPP paradigm. Furthermore, the effect of TPPU (30 mg/kg) on morphine-induced rewarding effects was examined. RESULTS: TPPU (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) did not increase CPP scores in the mice whereas morphine significantly increased CPP scores in the mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with TPPU did not block the rewarding effects of morphine in the mice, suggesting that sEH does not play a role in the rewarding effect of morphine. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that TPPU did not have rewarding effects in rodents. This would make sEH inhibitors potential therapeutic drugs without abuse potential for neuropathic pain.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gut. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (coded by the Ephx2 gene) plays an important role in inflammation, which has been implicated in stress-related depression. Ephx2 knock-out (KO) mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) did not show depression-like behaviors, indicating stress resilience. Here we examined whether the brain-gut-microbiota axis influences the resilience in Ephx2 KO mice. METHODS: Effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CSDS-susceptible (or control) mice in wild-type (WT) mice and Ephx2 KO mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) were investigated. Behavioral, biochemical tests and 16S ribosome RNA analysis were performed. RESULTS: FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice produced anhedonia-like behavior in ABX-treated WT and Ephx2 KO mice. The 16S ribosome RNA analysis showed that Faecalibaculum rodentium (F. rodentium) may be responsible for the observed anhedonia-like behavior following FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice. Ingestion of F. rodentium for 14 days produced depression- and anhedonia-like behaviors, higher blood levels of interleukin-6, and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex of ABX-treated Ephx2 KO mice. Furthermore, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked the development of these behavioral abnormalities after ingestion of F. rodentium. LIMITATIONS: Detailed mechanisms are unclear. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that F. rodentium might contribute to the conversion of resilient Ephx2 KO mice into KO mice with depression-like phenotypes. The brain-gut-microbiota axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve plays a crucial role in susceptibility and resilience to stress.",

In an effort to improve the efficacy of genetically engineered baculovirus pesticides, we have produced a recombinant that contains an insect specific toxin gene (AaIT) under the control of the promoter from an immediate early gene (ie1) of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). AaIT protein was detected as early as 4 h postinfection in cultured insect cells infected with this recombinant. The protein continued to accumulate as the infection progressed and, even as late as 24 h postinfection, the amount of AaIT was about equal to that provided by a recombinant that expressed AaIT under the control of the very late p10 promoter. Similar results were obtained with a recombinant that expressed a modified insect juvenile hormone esterase (JHE-KK) under ie1 control, confirming the ability of this promoter to provide early and abundant expression of gene products with potential pesticidal activity. Bioassays showed that the ie1-AaIT recombinant killed Heliothis virescens larvae faster than wild-type virus, but not faster than the p10-AaIT recombinant. However, larvae infected with the ie1-AaIT recombinant were smaller than those infected with the p10-AaIT recombinant, suggesting that expression of AaIT earlier in infection enhanced the ability of the virus to reduce the feeding activity of H. virescens larvae.",

        "abstract": "Wild-type Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV or AcNPV.WT), AcNPV expressing a scorpion toxin (AcNPV.AaIT), and AcNPV expressing a mutated juvenile hormone esterase (AcJHE.SG) were compared in their capability to produce epizootics in larvae of Trichoplusia ni infesting collards in a greenhouse microcosm. Larvae treated in four different ways were released into 1.8-m2 microplots in week 1. The four treatments included (1) uninfected larvae (control), (2) 100% AcNPV.WT-infected larvae (WT), (3) 100% AcNPV.AaIT-infected larvae (AaIT), and (4) 1:1 ratio of AcNPV.WT-infected and AcNPV.AaIT-infected larvae (WT+AaIT). On a weekly basis, larvae were sampled and new, uninfected larvae were added to all plots. Sampled larvae were reared until death and then subjected individually to DNA-DNA dot-blot hybridization assay to determine the proportion of insects infected with each virus in each plot. The entire experiment was repeated with AcJHE.SG in the place of AcNPV.AaIT. Epizootics of AcNPV.WT lasted 8 weeks after a single viral release in the replicated greenhouse microplots. AcJHE.SG epizootics also lasted 8 weeks after viral release, but this virus and AcNPV.AaIT were both out-competed by AcNPV.WT. AcNPV.AaIT was no longer detected in the T. ni population by the fourth week after release. AcNPV.WT also increased to greater numbers in soil than AcNPV.AaIT or AcJHE.SG after 8 weeks. Thus, it was possible to induce 8-week epizootics of AcNPV.WT in replicated microplots under artificial greenhouse conditions, and the wild-type virus out-competed the recombinant virus for a niche in this greenhouse microcosm, which reduces the probability that the recombinant virus will persist in an agroecosystem. © 2000 Academic Press.",

        "abstract": "Treatment of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma in dogs often requires a multidisciplinary approach and a thorough understanding of the CMF anatomical structures involved. This retrospective study aimed to utilize computed tomography (CT) studies of immature dogs evaluated for CMF trauma and to describe common fracture locations, treatment modalities, and complications, as well as the fracture healing outcomes. The medical records and CT studies of 94 dogs under 1 year of age over a 13-year period were evaluated. The skeletal location of CMF fractures, as well as the severity of displacement and fragmentation of each fracture, was recorded. Case demographic data and trauma etiology were also recorded. Animal bites accounted for the majority of trauma (71.0%). The most likely bone or region to be fractured was the maxillary bones, followed by the molar region of the mandibles. Up to 37 bones or specific regions were fractured in any given patient, with an average of 8.8 ± 3.1 fractured bones or regions per dog. Rostral mandibular trauma was associated with intra-articular fractures of the temporomandibular joint (p = 0.016). Patients sustained concomitant injuries in 32% of the cases. Muzzle therapy was the main treatment performed for most dogs (53.2%), followed by soft tissue closure (47.9%) and selective dental extractions (27.6%). Healing complications were recorded in 71.6% of the dogs, with malocclusion being the most reported complication (55.2%), and associated with dentate mandibular jaw fractures (p = 0.05). The average number of complications per dog was 2.4. No statistically significant association was found between treatment modality and healing outcome. There was a positive correlation between the severity of fracture fragmentation and displacement and a negative healing outcome (all rho >0.7). Further treatment was required in 55.6% of the dogs. Additional dental extractions were performed in 77.7% of patients. Healing complications were common in the immature CMF trauma case. Thus, the need for a comprehensive assessment of the entire CMF region during the initial visit, as well as follow-up, preferably using CT or cone beam CT, is underscored.",

ANIMALS: 47 client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES: In this retrospective study, 47 dogs had surgery to correct a TTAF before 10 months of age and had the implants left in situ past skeletal maturity. Of these, 42 were followed for a median of 36 months postoperatively. Short- and long-term complications were recorded and compared with historically published data in which the implants were removed within 6 weeks of surgery. RESULTS: 14% (6/42) of our population experienced minor long-term complications (stiffness and lameness), 6% (3/47) experienced major short-term complications (repair failure), and 14% (6/24) experienced major long-term complications (implant removal). There was no difference in long-term outcomes when compared with results of historical reports in which implants were removed 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Client satisfaction was high, with 93% (38/41) grading outcomes as excellent and 95% (39/41) stating they would have surgery performed again in retrospect. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Immature dogs with surgically repaired TTAFs have favorable long-term outcomes when the implants were left in situ past skeletal maturity. Dogs with TTAF repairs may not need implant removal unless it becomes clinically necessary. Avoiding a second procedure will decrease patient morbidity, recovery time, and cost.",

        "abstract": "Although cockatiels are among the most common avian species maintained as companion animals in the United States, information on standard hematologic reference values for this species is limited. The objectives of this study were to establish hematologic reference intervals (RI) for cockatiels, compare methods using both the Natt-Herrick technique (NHT) and the smear-based estimation technique (SBT), explore age and sex differences in the hematologic findings for this species, and produce the first cockatiel RI for fibrinogen concentration and thrombocyte estimate. Healthy cockatiels (60 males and 60 females, 2-11 years old) from a research colony were included in this study. Blood samples were placed in dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes, and erythrocyte counts and thrombocyte estimates were determined via automated analyzer (ADVIA 120) and SBT, respectively. Moreover, leukocyte concentrations were determined using both NHT and SBT to compare these common methods for measuring a complete blood count in cockatiels. Data were analyzed for outliers, distributions, descriptive statistics, and RI via Reference Value Adviser, a set of macroinstructions for Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Lymphocytes were the predominant leukocyte across both methods. According to the NHT, females had significantly higher concentrations of total leukocytes, heterophils, bands, lymphocytes, basophils, and total plasma protein compared with males. Significant inverse polynomial relationships were noted between total leukocyte count and age and lymphocyte counts and age for NHT. Total leukocyte count produced via NHT and SBT were compared using Passing-Bablok and Bland-Altman plots, and no significant constant or proportional biases were found. However, these methods showed wide limits of agreement. While the RI were interchangeable between methods from a clinical standpoint, the same method should be used to assess changes in an individual. The reported RI are uniquely robust given the sample size, balanced sex and age distributions, inclusion criteria, and control over sample collection.",

STUDY DESIGN:  Medical records (October 2016-June 2019) of dog and cat fractures repaired with the LLS were reviewed. Data reviewed included signalment, fracture classification, complications and radiographic outcome. RESULTS:  The LLS was used to repair 60 fractures (57 appendicular and 3 axial) in 54 dogs and 6 cats. Mean time to radiographic union was 6 weeks (range: 4-16). Radiographic union was achieved in all 60 fractures with 55/60 healing without recorded complications. Major complications 4/60 and minor complication 1/60 rates were low and no catastrophic complications occurred. The most common major complication was surgical site infection. CONCLUSION:  The LLS allowed for successful repair in all 60 cases with a wide variety of fractures. The LLS had a similar complication rate and time to radiographic union to that reported in other veterinary locking plate systems. The LLS is a reliable locking plate system which offers some advantages such as a low-profile plate with the ability to place non-polyaxial to angled polyaxial screws, to treat fractures in dogs and cats.",

METHODS: An ecologic evaluation of county-level incidence of lymphomas by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status for the state of California with data obtained from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Synthetic turf field density by county was obtained from the Synthetic Turf Council. During 2000-2013, 7214 14- to 30-year-old Californians were diagnosed with malignant lymphoma. RESULTS: Annual lymphoma county incidence trends were not associated with the county-level synthetic turf field density. None of 20 sub-analyses by race/ethnicity, sex and county median household income indicated a correlation of lymphoma incidence with synthetic turf field density. In California, there was no evidence at the county-level that synthetic turf fields are associated with an increased incidence of lymphoma in adolescents and young adults. CONCLUSION: Our findings in the state with the greatest number of such fields and a large, diverse patient population are consistent with those of a prior study observing no association between individual-level exposures to turf fields and cancer incidence. Avoidance of synthetic turf fields for fear of increased cancer risk is not warranted.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma is one of the most common malignancies during pregnancy. There is debate regarding the impact of pregnancy on the prognosis of melanoma. Recent large population-based studies from the United States are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics and survival of women with pregnancy-associated melanoma. METHODS: This population-based, retrospective cohort study used California Cancer Registry data linked with state-wide hospitalization and ambulatory surgery data to identify 15-44-year-old female patients diagnosed with melanoma in 1994-2015, including pregnant patients. Multivariable logistic regression compared demographic and clinical characteristics between pregnant and non-pregnant women with melanoma. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression models assessed melanoma-specific and overall survival. RESULTS: We identified 13 108 patients, of which 1406 were pregnant. Pregnancy-associated melanoma was more frequent in Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White women. Melanoma occurring post-partum was associated with greater tumour thickness (2.01-4.00 vs. 0.01-1.00 mm, odds ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.98). There were otherwise no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. Worse survival was associated with Asian, Black and Native American race/ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic White), lower neighbourhood socio-economic status, public insurance, tumour site, greater tumour thickness and lymph node involvement, but not pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma occurring post-partum was associated with greater tumour thickness, but pregnancy status did not affect survival after melanoma. Race/ethnicity, socio-economic status and health insurance impacted survival, emphasizing the importance of reducing health disparities.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Engagement of patients in their care can lead to better health outcomes, especially for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors who experience mental and physical illnesses more often than noncancer adults. We examined how patient engagement in care influences health care expenses and use. Methods: AYA cancer survivors (n = 1162) and a comparison group of matched adults with no history of cancer (n = 2954) were identified from the 2011 to 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. Medical expenditures and health care utilization associated with shared decision-making (SDM) measured by a self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Clinician and Group (CAHPS-CG) survey were evaluated using multivariable regression models. Results: AYA cancer survivors were more likely to report poor SDM compared with adults with no history of cancer (odds ratio = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]): 1.06 to 1.62). AYA cancer survivors with poor SDM were more likely to report poor mental and physical health compared with AYAs with good SDM. AYA cancer survivors with poor SDM had $3037 (CI: $110 to $7032) in additional annual medical expenses and 4.86 (CI: 2.00 to 8.52) in additional office visits compared with AYA cancer survivors with optimal SDM, even after adjusting for chronic conditions and psychological distress. Conclusion: Our results highlight the substantial economic burden associated with poor SDM in AYA cancer survivors. Our research suggests that interventions to improve SDM in AYA cancer survivors may contribute to patients' positive perception of their health and result in AYAs seeking fewer medical services resulting in lower medical expenses.",

We used the California Cancer Registry linked to a statewide hospital discharge database to identify children and AYAs with TRTs within 3 years of diagnosis. We assessed the frequency of TRTs, length of stay (LOS), admission rates associated with TRTs and TRTs impact on survival. Febrile neutropenia, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia were the most common TRTs for both children and AYAs. AYAs had longer median LOS compared to children for most toxicities. AYAs at non-specialized cancer centers (SCCs) had higher frequency of admissions associated with TRTs compared to non-SCC. Cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, and infectious TRTs were associated with worse survival. This study demonstrates the burden of TRTs in patients with ALL.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are associated with inferior health outcomes among cancer survivors, including increased mortality. It is crucial to identify vulnerable subgroups, yet investigations have been limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with risky health behaviors among cancer survivors. METHODS: We used national, cross-sectional survey data (Health Information National Trends Survey, HINTS 2017-2020) for 2579 cancer survivors. We calculated the prevalence of risky alcohol use, current cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and not meeting physical activity guidelines. We performed weighted logistic regression to obtain multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the association between each unhealthy behavior with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 25% showed risky alcohol use, 12% were current cigarette smokers, 3% were current e-cigarette users, and 68% did not meet physical activity guidelines. Cancer survivors who were males, non-Hispanic Whites or African Americans, without a college education, not married and with comorbidities or psychological distress were more likely to have unhealthy behaviors. Those with lung disease or depression were 2 times as likely to smoke cigarette or e-cigarettes and those with psychological distress were 1.6 times as likely to be physically inactive. Moreover, risky drinkers (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.22-2.52) and e-cigarette smokers (OR = 16.40, 95% CI 3.29-81.89) were more likely to be current cigarette smokers. CONCLUSIONS: We identified vulnerable subpopulations of cancer survivors with multiple unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our findings inform clinicians and program and policy makers of the subgroups of cancer survivors to target for multiple health behavior interventions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Older men with the worse alignment of activity and light may have lower levels of cognition and increased rates of cognitive decline. METHODS: This cohort consisted of 1 036 older men (81.1 ± 4.6 years) from the MrOS Sleep Study (2009-2012). Light and activity levels were gathered by wrist actigraphy. Phasor analysis was used to quantify the alignment of light-dark and rest-activity patterns (magnitude) and their temporal relationship (angle). Global cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental State examination [3MS]) and executive function (Trails B test) were measured, then repeated 4.2 ± 0.8 years later. Linear regression models examined the associations of phasor magnitude and angle with cognition and cognitive decline. Models were adjusted for age, clinic, race, education, and season. RESULTS: Smaller phasor magnitude (worse aligned light and activity patterns) was associated with lower initial level and increased decline in executive function. Compared to those with higher phasor magnitude, those with lower magnitude took an average of 11.1 seconds longer to complete the Trails B test (quartile 1 vs quartile 4, p = .02). After follow-up, Trails B completion time increased an average of 5.5 seconds per standard deviation decrease in phasor magnitude (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-10.4, p = .03). There were no associations with phasor angle, and none with magnitude and global cognition (3MS). CONCLUSION: Among older men, worse alignment of light and activity patterns was associated with worse initial performance and increased decline in executive function, but not related to global cognition. Interventions that improve the alignment of light and activity may slow cognitive decline in older adults.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain, a possible marker of central sensitization, is associated with higher prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among older men. We investigated whether musculoskeletal pain is associated with LUTS progression. METHODS: Participants were 5 569 men age ≥65 years enrolled in the prospective, multicenter Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study. Self-reported musculoskeletal pain within 12 months before baseline was categorized as any pain and multilocation pain. Pain interference within 4 weeks of baseline was assessed with the SF-12 questionnaire. LUTS were assessed repeatedly with the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI). Men with severe LUTS at baseline were excluded. LUTS progression was defined as the first occurrence of a ≥4-point AUA-SI increase during a 2-year follow-up interval. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable pooled logistic regression. RESULTS: LUTS progression was 37% higher among men with any musculoskeletal pain compared with men without pain (IRR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.54). Positive associations were also observed between LUTS progression and pain at 1 (IRR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.48) and ≥2 locations (IRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.60). Compared with men without pain interference, men with quite a bit/extreme pain interference were most likely to experience LUTS progression (minimal interference IRR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.26; moderate interference IRR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.45; quite a bit/extreme interference IRR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.71). CONCLUSIONS: Among men initially without severe LUTS, musculoskeletal pain is associated with an increased risk of LUTS progression. Studies using validated measures of central sensitization and LUTS progression among men are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Microgravity-induced bone loss is a main obstacle for long term space missions as it is difficult to maintain bone mass when loading stimuli is reduced. With a typical bone mineral density loss of 1.5% per month of microgravity exposure, the chances for osteoporosis and fractures may endanger astronauts' health. Parathyroid Hormone or PTH (1-34) is an FDA approved treatment for osteoporosis, and may reverse microgravity-induced bone loss. However, PTH proteins requires refrigeration, daily subcutaneous injection, and have a short shelf-life, limiting its use in a resource-limited environment, like space. In this study, PTH was produced in an Fc-fusion form via transient expression in plants, to improve the circulatory half-life which reduces dosing frequency and to simplify purification if needed. Plant-based expression is well-suited for space medicine application given its low resource consumption and short expression timeline. The PTH-Fc accumulation profile in plant was established with a peak expression on day 5 post infiltration of 373 ± 59 mg/kg leaf fresh weight. Once the PTH-Fc was purified, the amino acid sequence and the binding affinity to its target, PTH 1 receptor (PTH1R), was determined utilizing biolayer interferometry (BLI). The binding affinity between PTH-Fc and PTH1R was 2.30 × 10-6 M, similar to the affinity between PTH (1-34) and PTH1R (2.31 × 10-6 M). Its function was also confirmed in a cell-based receptor stimulation assay, where PTH-Fc was able to stimulate the PTH1R producing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with an EC50 of (8.54 ± 0.12) x 10-9 M, comparable to the EC50 from the PTH (1-34) of 1.49 × 10-8 M. These results suggest that plant recombinant PTH-Fc exhibits a similar binding affinity and potency in a PTH1R activation assay compared to PTH. Furthermore, it can be produced rapidly at high levels with minimal resources and reagents, making it ideal for production in low resource environments such as space.",

        "abstract": "A search is reported for high-mass hadronic resonances that decay to a parton and a Lorentz-boosted resonance, which in turn decays into a pair of partons. The search is based on data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at s=13TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138fb−1. The boosted resonance is reconstructed as a single wide jet with substructure consistent with a two-body decay. The high-mass resonance is thus considered as a dijet system. The jet substructure information and the kinematic properties of cascade resonance decays are exploited to disentangle the signal from the large quantum chromodynamics multijet background. The dijet mass spectrum is analyzed for the presence of new high-mass resonances, and is found to be consistent with the standard model background predictions. Results are interpreted in a warped extra dimension model where the high-mass resonance is a Kaluza–Klein gluon, the boosted resonance is a radion, and the final state partons are all gluons. Limits on the production cross section are set as a function of the Kaluza–Klein gluon and radion masses. These limits exclude at 95% confidence level models with Kaluza–Klein gluon masses in the range 2.0 to 4.3 TeV and radion masses in the range 0.20 to 0.74 TeV. By exploring a novel experimental signature, the observed limits on the Kaluza–Klein gluon mass are extended by up to about 1 TeV compared to previous searches.",

        "abstract": "A search for new heavy resonances decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons (HH) in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented. Data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016–2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1. Resonances with a mass between 0.8 and 4.5 TeV are considered using events in which one Higgs boson decays into a bottom quark pair and the other into final states with either one or two charged leptons. Specifically, the single-lepton decay channel HH→ b b ¯ WW∗→ b b ¯ ℓvq q ¯ ′ and the dilepton decay channels HH→ b b ¯ WW∗→ b b ¯ ℓvℓv and HH→ b b ¯ ττ→ b b ¯ ℓvvℓvv are examined, where ℓ in the final state corresponds to an electron or muon. The signal is extracted using a two-dimensional maximum likelihood fit of the H → b b ¯ jet mass and HH invariant mass distributions. No significant excess above the standard model expectation is observed in data. Model-independent exclusion limits are placed on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for narrow spin-0 and spin-2 massive bosons decaying to HH. The results are also interpreted in the context of radion and bulk graviton production in models with a warped extra spatial dimension. The results provide the most stringent limits to date for X → HH signatures with final-state leptons and at some masses provide the most sensitive limits of all X → HH searches.

        "abstract": "Results are presented from a search for physics beyond the standard model in proton-proton collisions at s = 13 TeV in channels with two Higgs bosons, each decaying via the process H → bb ¯ , and large missing transverse momentum. The search uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb−1 collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The search is motivated by models of supersymmetry that predict the production of neutralinos, the neutral partners of the electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons. The observed event yields in the signal regions are found to be consistent with the standard model background expectations. The results are interpreted using simplified models of supersymmetry. For the electroweak production of nearly mass-degenerate higgsinos, each of whose decay chains yields a neutralino (χ~10) that in turn decays to a massless goldstino and a Higgs boson, (χ~10) masses in the range 175 to 1025 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. For the strong production of gluino pairs decaying via a slightly lighter (χ~20) to H and a light (χ~10), gluino masses below 2330 GeV are excluded. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, detailed studies of its properties have been ongoing. Besides its mass, its width—related to its lifetime—is an important parameter. One way to determine this quantity is to measure its off-shell production, where the Higgs boson mass is far away from its nominal value, and relating it to its on-shell production, where the mass is close to the nominal value. Here we report evidence for such off-shell contributions to the production cross-section of two Z bosons with data from the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We constrain the total rate of the off-shell Higgs boson contribution beyond the Z boson pair production threshold, relative to its standard model expectation, to the interval [0.0061, 2.0] at the 95% confidence level. The scenario with no off-shell contribution is excluded at a p-value of 0.0003 (3.6 standard deviations). We measure the width of the Higgs boson as ΓH=3.2−1.7+2.4MeV, in agreement with the standard model expectation of 4.1 MeV. In addition, we set constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings to W and Z boson pairs.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral white matter hyperintensities on MRI are markers of cerebral small vessel disease, a major risk factor for dementia and stroke. Despite the successful identification of multiple genetic variants associated with this highly heritable condition, its genetic architecture remains incompletely understood. More specifically, the role of DNA methylation has received little attention. We investigated the association between white matter hyperintensity burden and DNA methylation in blood at ∼450 000 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in 9732 middle-aged to older adults from 14 community-based studies. Single CpG and region-based association analyses were carried out. Functional annotation and integrative cross-omics analyses were performed to identify novel genes underlying the relationship between DNA methylation and white matter hyperintensities. We identified 12 single CpG and 46 region-based DNA methylation associations with white matter hyperintensity burden. Our top discovery single CpG, cg24202936 (P = 7.6 × 10-8), was associated with F2 expression in blood (P = 6.4 × 10-5) and co-localized with FOLH1 expression in brain (posterior probability = 0.75). Our top differentially methylated regions were in PRMT1 and in CCDC144NL-AS1, which were also represented in single CpG associations (cg17417856 and cg06809326, respectively). Through Mendelian randomization analyses cg06809326 was putatively associated with white matter hyperintensity burden (P = 0.03) and expression of CCDC144NL-AS1 possibly mediated this association. Differentially methylated region analysis, joint epigenetic association analysis and multi-omics co-localization analysis consistently identified a role of DNA methylation near SH3PXD2A, a locus previously identified in genome-wide association studies of white matter hyperintensities. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed functions of the identified DNA methylation loci in the blood-brain barrier and in the immune response. Integrative cross-omics analysis identified 19 key regulatory genes in two networks related to extracellular matrix organization, and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. A drug-repositioning analysis indicated antihyperlipidaemic agents, more specifically peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, as possible target drugs for white matter hyperintensities. Our epigenome-wide association study and integrative cross-omics analyses implicate novel genes influencing white matter hyperintensity burden, which converged on pathways related to the immune response and to a compromised blood-brain barrier possibly due to disrupted cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The results also suggest that antihyperlipidaemic therapy may contribute to lowering risk for white matter hyperintensities possibly through protection against blood-brain barrier disruption.",

        "abstract": "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder present with difficulties in social communication, restricted interests or behaviors and other co-morbidities. About 2 to 10% of cases of autism have a genetic cause, and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is reported in 0 to 6.5% of individuals with autism. However, the FXS and premutation prevalence among Filipino children has never been reported. The aim of the study was to establish the presence of FXS or premutation carriers among Filipino children with autism and to describe the phenotypic characteristic of cases identified. Blood was collected from 235 children aged 2-6 years old and diagnosed with autism. Samples were analyzed using PCR methods to amplify CGG repeats in the FMRI gene. The diagnosis of autism was confirmed through the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2. Additional characteristics were documented from a physical examination, Griffiths Scales of Child Development assessment and a parent-answered questionnaire using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Fragile X testing through PCR methods in 235 children with diagnosed autism showed 220 (93.6%) were negative, no full mutations, 1 (0.436%) premutation carrier and 14 (5.95%) cases contained intermediate alleles. The FXS testing was limited to confirmed cases of autism, which is considered a high-risk group and does not provide prevalence for the general Filipino population. Subjects were self-referred or referred by clinicians, which may not represent the Filipino autism population with a bias towards those with means for clinical consultations and ability to travel to the place of testing. Samples were not measured for mosaicism, DNA methylation or AGG interspersion patterns. These may have effects on the CGG repeat expansion and overall presentation of FXS. Findings from a single premutation carrier cannot characterize features distinctly present in Filipinos with the mutation. Nevertheless, these results support the data that the prevalence of FXS in Asian populations may be lower than non-Asian populations. This can contribute to a better understanding of FXS and genetic causes of autism in the Philippines and other Asian populations.",

Phenotypically, individuals with FXS also present with distinct physical features including, elongated face, prominent ears, pectus excavatum, macroorchidism, and joint laxity, which suggests connective tissue dysplasia. In addition to mitral valve prolapse, aortic dilatation has been identified within individuals with FXS. Abnormal elastin fiber networks have been found in the skin, valves, and aorta in individual cases. Aortic dilatation has been described in other connective tissue disorders, particularly Marfan syndrome. However, while aortic aneurysms are characteristic of Marfan syndrome, no similar cases have been reported in FXS patients to date. This case report details the presentation of two patients with FXS and aortic aneurysm. Our two cases highlight the risks of aortic pathology in FXS, and the need for monitoring in asymptomatic patients with significant aortic dilatation.",

In Phase 1, revision, we implemented a Delphi technique identifying pertinent domains/subdomains and developing items through expert consensus. In Phase 2, content validation, we conducted cognitive pretesting assessing comprehensibility, comprehensiveness, and relevance of items to FXTAS motor signs. RESULTS: After five rounds of Delphi panel and two rounds of cognitive pretesting, the revised version of the FXTAS-RS was established with 18 items covering five domains and 13 subdomains of motor signs. Cognitive pretesting revealed adequate content validity for the assessment of FXTAS motor signs. CONCLUSION: The revised FXTAS-RS has been successfully validated for content and it is now ready for large-scale field validation.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study examined relationships among family characteristics, caregiver change in use of strategies, and child growth in spoken language over the course of a parent-implemented language intervention (PILI) that was developed to address some of the challenges associated with the fragile X syndrome (FXS) phenotype. METHOD: Participants were 43 parent-child dyads from two different PILI studies, both of which taught parents various language facilitation strategies to support child language. Before starting the intervention, parents reported on their mental health, parenting stress, and parenting competence. This study focused on potential barriers to treatment gains by examining correlations between the measures of parent well-being and (a) parent change in use of intervention strategies taught in the PILI and (b) changes in child language outcomes from preto post-intervention. RESULTS: Parents in this study had elevated mental health symptoms across several domains and increased rates of parenting stress. Furthermore, although PILI resulted in treatment gains for both parents and children, a variety of parent mental health symptoms were found to be significantly and negatively associated with change in use of strategies and growth in child language over the course of the intervention. Some inconsistent findings also emerged regarding the relationships between parenting stress and competence and change in parent strategy use and growth in child language. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that parents who are experiencing significant mental health challenges may have a more difficult time participating fully in PILIs and that there may be subsequent effects on child outcomes. Future PILIs could benefit from addressing parent well-being as a substantial part of the intervention program.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the mass structure of a strong gravitational lens galaxy at z = 0.350, taking advantage of the milliarcsecond (mas) angular resolution of very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations. In the first analysis of its kind at this resolution, we jointly infer the lens model parameters and pixellated radio source surface brightness. We consider several lens models of increasing complexity, starting from an elliptical power-law density profile. We extend this model to include angular multipole structures, a separate stellar mass component, additional nearby field galaxies, and/or a generic external potential. We compare these models using their relative Bayesian log-evidence (Bayes factor). We find strong evidence for angular structure in the lens; our best model is comprised of a power-law profile plus multipole perturbations and external potential, with a Bayes factor of +14984 relative to the elliptical power-law model. It is noteworthy that the elliptical power-law mass distribution is a remarkably good fit on its own, with additional model complexity correcting the deflection angles only at the ∼5 mas level. We also consider the effects of added complexity in the lens model on time-delay cosmography and flux-ratio analyses. We find that an overly simplistic power-law ellipsoid lens model can bias the measurement of H0 by ∼3 per cent and mimic flux ratio anomalies of ∼8 per cent. Our results demonstrate the power of high-resolution VLBI observations to provide strong constraints on the inner density profiles of lens galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational time delays provide a powerful one-step measurement of H0, independent of all other probes. One key ingredient in time-delay cosmography are high-accuracy lens models. Those are currently expensive to obtain, both, in terms of computing and investigator time (105-106 CPU hours and ∼0.5-1 yr, respectively). Major improvements in modelling speed are therefore necessary to exploit the large number of lenses that are forecast to be discovered over the current decade. In order to bypass this roadblock, we develop an automated modelling pipeline and apply it to a sample of 31 lens systems, observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in multiple bands. Our automated pipeline can derive models for 30/31 lenses with few hours of human time and <100 CPU hours of computing time for a typical system. For each lens, we provide measurements of key parameters and predictions of magnification as well as time delays for the multiple images. We characterize the cosmography-readiness of our models using the stability of differences in the Fermat potential (proportional to time delay) with respect to modelling choices. We find that for 10/30 lenses, our models are cosmography or nearly cosmography grade (<3 per cent and 3-5 per cent variations). For 6/30 lenses, the models are close to cosmography grade (5-10 per cent). These results utilize informative priors and will need to be confirmed by further analysis. However, they are also likely to improve by extending the pipeline modelling sequence and options. In conclusion, we show that uniform cosmography grade modelling of large strong lens samples is within reach.",

        "abstract": "We have measured the redshifts and single-aperture velocity dispersions of eight lens galaxies using the data collected by the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) and Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) at W.M. Keck observatory on different observing nights spread over three years (2018-2020). These results, combined with other ancillary data, such as high-resolution images of the lens systems, and time delays, are necessary to increase the sample size of the quasar-galaxy lens systems for which the Hubble constant can be measured, using the time-delay strong lensing method, hence increasing the precision of its inference. Typically, the 2D spectra of the quasar-galaxy lens systems get spatially blended due to seeing by ground-based observations. As a result, the extracted lensing galaxy (deflector) spectra become significantly contaminated by quasar light, which affects the ability to extract meaningful information about the deflector. To account for spatial blending and extract less contaminated and higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) 1D spectra of the deflectors, a forward modeling method has been implemented. From the extracted spectra, we have measured redshifts using prominent absorption lines and single aperture velocity dispersions using the penalized pixel fitting code pPXF. In this paper, we report the redshifts and single aperture velocity dispersions of eight lens galaxies -J0147+4630, B0445+123, B0631+519, J0659+1629, J0818-2613, J0924+0219, J1433+6007, and J1817+2729. Among these systems, six do not have previously measured velocity dispersions; for the other two, our measurements are consistent with previously reported values. Additionally, we have measured the previously unknown redshifts of the deflectors in J0818-2613 and J1817+2729 to be 0.866 ± 0.002 and 0.408 ± 0.002, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Strong-lensing time delays enable the measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) independently of other traditional methods. The main limitation to the precision of time-delay cosmography is mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD). Some of the previous TDCOSMO analyses broke the MSD by making standard assumptions about the mass density profile of the lens galaxy, reaching 2% precision from seven lenses. However, this approach could potentially bias the H0 measurement or underestimate the errors. For this work, we broke the MSD for the first time using spatially resolved kinematics of the lens galaxy in RXJ1131-1231 obtained from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy, in combination with previously published time delay and lens models derived from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. This approach allowed us to robustly estimate H0, effectively implementing a maximally flexible mass model. Following a blind analysis, we estimated the angular diameter distance to the lens galaxy Dd=865-81+85 Mpc and the time-delay distance Dδ t=2180-271+472 Mpc, giving H0=77.1-7.1+7.3 km s-1 Mpc-1 -for a flat δcold dark matter cosmology. The error budget accounts for all uncertainties, including the MSD inherent to the lens mass profile and line-of-sight effects, and those related to the mass-anisotropy degeneracy and projection effects. Our new measurement is in excellent agreement with those obtained in the past using standard simply parametrized mass profiles for this single system (H0=78.3-3.3+3.4 km s-1 Mpc-1) and for seven lenses (H0=74.2-1.6+1.6 km s-1 Mpc-1), or for seven lenses using single-aperture kinematics and the same maximally flexible models used by us (H0=73.3-5.8+5.8 km s-1 Mpc-1). This agreement corroborates the methodology of time-delay cosmography.",

        "abstract": "In most Asian countries, farmers have smallholdings ranging from one to two hectares. The tractor-mounted boom sprayers cannot practically be used in small size farms with divided plots and complex terrain. To cope with these issues, a prototype self-propelled crop sprayer was developed, including a 20-hp engine, 300 L liquid tank, and hydraulically-controlled spray boom with eight hollow cone nozzles. The spray symmetry of the hollow cone nozzle was evaluated under four pressures (2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 bar) in the laboratory. The operating parameters of the sprayer, such as forward speed (4, 6, and 8 km h−1), spray height (40, 55, and 70 cm), and pressure (3, 5, and 7 bar) were optimized by measuring three spray characteristics including droplet density, coverage percentage, and Volume Median Diameter (VMD) in the cotton field. The results revealed that the nozzle spray was symmetrical at 2.5 and 3 bar pressure as the R2 value was higher than 0.96. The field test result showed that in all treatments, treatments T14 (6 km h−1, 55 cm, 5 bar) and T22 (8 km h−1, 55 cm, 3 bar) were suitable for spraying medium-to-low concentration solution (post-emergence herbicides and fungicides) and high concentration solution (insecticides and pre-emergence herbicides), respectively. The spray characteristics at treatments T14 and T22 were 64.7 droplets cm−2, 26.7%, 230 µm, and 39 droplets cm−2, 14.9%, and 219.8 µm respectively. The field efficiency of the sprayer was 61%. The spraying cost per unit area was 55–64% less compared to manual labor cost. In conclusion, a prototype self-propelled crop sprayer is an efficient and environment-friendly technology for small farms. Operating the sprayer at the optimal parameters also saves operational costs and time.",

        "abstract": "All-terrain vehicle (ATV) incidents are one of the leading causes of injuries and fatalities among youth in the agricultural industry. It has been hypothesized that many youth-related ATV incidents occur because children ride ATVs that do not fit their capabilities and are not following basic safe riding practices. In addition, various ATV safety guidelines regarding youth (e.g., CPSC, ANSI/SVIA, ASI) are inconsistent and may not align with state or local laws. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have compared the physical and mental requirements for riding ATVs and the youth's capabilities to ride ATVs safely. Consequently, there are no scientific-based recommendations for age limitation, physical and mental capabilities, and safety requirements for youth to ride ATVs safely. Thus, there is a need to review the available sources related to youth safety and ATVs in the agricultural industry, identify the research voids, and recommend modifications to current ATV guidelines. This study conducted a systematic review of available ATV-related studies, standards, guidelines, and laws to establish better-informed minimum age, physical and mental capabilities, and safety requirements for youths to ride ATVs on the farm.",

        "abstract": "PROBLEM: Utility All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) are one major cause of youth injuries and fatalities on farms. Utility ATVs have heavy weights and fast speeds that require complex maneuvering. Youth's physical capabilities may not be sufficient to perform those complex maneuvers correctly. Therefore, it is hypothesized that most youth engage in ATV-related incidents because they ride vehicles unfit for them. There is a need to assess ATV-youth fit based on youth anthropometry. METHOD: This study focused on evaluating potential inconsistencies between the operational requirements of utility ATVs and the anthropometric measures of youth through virtual simulations. Virtual simulations were performed to assess 11 youth-ATV fit guidelines proposed by several ATV safety advocacy organizations (National 4-H council, CPSC, IPCH, and FReSH). In total, 17 utility ATVs along with male-and-female-youth of nine ages (8 to 16 years old) and three height percentiles (5th, 50th, and 95th) were evaluated. RESULTS: The results demonstrated a physical mismatch between ATVs' operational requirements and youth's anthropometry. For example, male-youth aged 16 of the 95th height percentile failed to pass at least 1 out of the 11 fit guidelines for 35 % of all vehicles evaluated. The results were even more concerning for females. Female youth 10 years old and younger (from all height percentiles) failed to pass at least one fit guideline for all ATVs evaluated. DISCUSSION: Youth are not recommended to ride utility ATVs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study provides quantitative and systematic evidence to modify current ATV safety guidelines. Furthermore, youth occupational health professionals could use the present findings to prevent ATV-related incidents in agricultural settings.",

It is hypothesised that youth are involved in ATV-related incidents because they cannot effectively activate the vehicle's controls. This study evaluated potential discrepancies between the required activation forces of the controls of fifty-four utility ATVs and the strength of male-and-female youth of varying ages (6-20 years old) and strength percentiles (5th, 50th, and 95th). The activation forces of the ATVs' controls were measured experimentally, while the youth's corresponding strength was retrieved from the literature. The results of this study demonstrated a physical mismatch between the forces required to operate ATV controls and youth's strength. Turning the handlebar, pressing the footbrake, and pushing the ATV off are the most difficult tasks for ATV operation. These discrepancies compromise the youth's ability to ride ATVs, increasing their risk of crashes. Practitioner summary: Previous studies indicate that some youth engage in ATV incidents because they cannot activate the vehicle's controls. We measured the forces required to operate eight ATV controls and compared them with the youth's corresponding strength. Our results demonstrated physical mismatches between the forces required to operate ATV controls and the youth's strength.",

        "abstract": "HIGHLIGHTS: Previous quad bike educational interventions focused solely on operator behavior, leading to positive shifts in 'safety knowledge' but very little change in actual rider behavior. Discussions in a recent virtual ATV Safety Symposium hosted by the University of California-Davis (2022) emphasized building agricultural community awareness of quad bike engineering controls-particularly in the U.S. and other nations. Outreach specialists in agriculture should begin to prioritize more discussion of quad bike engineering controls in training programs. ABSTRACT: To date, most quad bike educational programs have featured an operator-focused approach, focusing on adherence to administrative controls, personal responsibility, and personal protective equipment. Though these programs lead to shifts in 'safety knowledge', they result in very little change in actual rider behavior. In this perspectives article, we highlight discussions from a recent ATV Safety Symposium and USDA-NIFA review of agricultural ATV safety in the U.S. that highlight the dire need for building agricultural community awareness of quad bike engineering controls such as CPDs, wider and more stable frame designs, and others. Although CPDs were introduced 15 years ago, we continue to observe low awareness of this and other important quad bike safety features among young adults in agriculture. We believe that it will be critical to apply some of the recommendations outlined in this article to improve future outreach programs focused on quad bike safety for agricultural occupational use. If rural, agricultural communities learn to accept and respect these life-saving technologies, future standards, policies, and legislative actions are more likely to be well-received.",

Here we studied whether expression of sEH protein is altered in the postmortem samples (parietal cortex, and liver) from patients with major psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Protein expression of sEH in the parietal cortex and liver from control, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ) groups was measured. RESULTS: Levels of sEH in the parietal cortex and liver from MDD, BD, and SZ groups were significantly higher than the control group. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between sEH protein in the parietal cortex and sEH protein the liver in all groups. LIMITATIONS: The small number in each group may limit our interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the increased expression of sEH in the brain and liver might play a role in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, suggesting a role of brain - liver axis in major psychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "AIM: Although opioids have been used as treatment of neuropathic pain, opioids have abuse potential in humans. Since soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids plays a key role in the pain, sEH inhibitors would be promising new therapeutic drugs for neuropathic pain. In this study, we examined the effect of the sEH inhibitor TPPU on rewarding effects in mice using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. METHODS: The rewarding effects of morphine (10 mg/kg) and TPPU (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) in mice were examined using CPP paradigm. Furthermore, the effect of TPPU (30 mg/kg) on morphine-induced rewarding effects was examined. RESULTS: TPPU (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) did not increase CPP scores in the mice whereas morphine significantly increased CPP scores in the mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with TPPU did not block the rewarding effects of morphine in the mice, suggesting that sEH does not play a role in the rewarding effect of morphine. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that TPPU did not have rewarding effects in rodents. This would make sEH inhibitors potential therapeutic drugs without abuse potential for neuropathic pain.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gut. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (coded by the Ephx2 gene) plays an important role in inflammation, which has been implicated in stress-related depression. Ephx2 knock-out (KO) mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) did not show depression-like behaviors, indicating stress resilience. Here we examined whether the brain-gut-microbiota axis influences the resilience in Ephx2 KO mice. METHODS: Effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CSDS-susceptible (or control) mice in wild-type (WT) mice and Ephx2 KO mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) were investigated. Behavioral, biochemical tests and 16S ribosome RNA analysis were performed. RESULTS: FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice produced anhedonia-like behavior in ABX-treated WT and Ephx2 KO mice. The 16S ribosome RNA analysis showed that Faecalibaculum rodentium (F. rodentium) may be responsible for the observed anhedonia-like behavior following FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice. Ingestion of F. rodentium for 14 days produced depression- and anhedonia-like behaviors, higher blood levels of interleukin-6, and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex of ABX-treated Ephx2 KO mice. Furthermore, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked the development of these behavioral abnormalities after ingestion of F. rodentium. LIMITATIONS: Detailed mechanisms are unclear. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that F. rodentium might contribute to the conversion of resilient Ephx2 KO mice into KO mice with depression-like phenotypes. The brain-gut-microbiota axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve plays a crucial role in susceptibility and resilience to stress.",

In an effort to improve the efficacy of genetically engineered baculovirus pesticides, we have produced a recombinant that contains an insect specific toxin gene (AaIT) under the control of the promoter from an immediate early gene (ie1) of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). AaIT protein was detected as early as 4 h postinfection in cultured insect cells infected with this recombinant. The protein continued to accumulate as the infection progressed and, even as late as 24 h postinfection, the amount of AaIT was about equal to that provided by a recombinant that expressed AaIT under the control of the very late p10 promoter. Similar results were obtained with a recombinant that expressed a modified insect juvenile hormone esterase (JHE-KK) under ie1 control, confirming the ability of this promoter to provide early and abundant expression of gene products with potential pesticidal activity. Bioassays showed that the ie1-AaIT recombinant killed Heliothis virescens larvae faster than wild-type virus, but not faster than the p10-AaIT recombinant. However, larvae infected with the ie1-AaIT recombinant were smaller than those infected with the p10-AaIT recombinant, suggesting that expression of AaIT earlier in infection enhanced the ability of the virus to reduce the feeding activity of H. virescens larvae.",

The four treatments included (1) uninfected larvae (control), (2) 100% AcNPV.WT-infected larvae (WT), (3) 100% AcNPV.AaIT-infected larvae (AaIT), and (4) 1:1 ratio of AcNPV.WT-infected and AcNPV.AaIT-infected larvae (WT+AaIT). On a weekly basis, larvae were sampled and new, uninfected larvae were added to all plots. Sampled larvae were reared until death and then subjected individually to DNA-DNA dot-blot hybridization assay to determine the proportion of insects infected with each virus in each plot. The entire experiment was repeated with AcJHE.SG in the place of AcNPV.AaIT. Epizootics of AcNPV.WT lasted 8 weeks after a single viral release in the replicated greenhouse microplots. AcJHE.SG epizootics also lasted 8 weeks after viral release, but this virus and AcNPV.AaIT were both out-competed by AcNPV.WT. AcNPV.AaIT was no longer detected in the T. ni population by the fourth week after release. AcNPV.WT also increased to greater numbers in soil than AcNPV.AaIT or AcJHE.SG after 8 weeks. Thus, it was possible to induce 8-week epizootics of AcNPV.WT in replicated microplots under artificial greenhouse conditions, and the wild-type virus out-competed the recombinant virus for a niche in this greenhouse microcosm, which reduces the probability that the recombinant virus will persist in an agroecosystem. © 2000 Academic Press.",

        "abstract": "Treatment of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma in dogs often requires a multidisciplinary approach and a thorough understanding of the CMF anatomical structures involved. This retrospective study aimed to utilize computed tomography (CT) studies of immature dogs evaluated for CMF trauma and to describe common fracture locations, treatment modalities, and complications, as well as the fracture healing outcomes. The medical records and CT studies of 94 dogs under 1 year of age over a 13-year period were evaluated. The skeletal location of CMF fractures, as well as the severity of displacement and fragmentation of each fracture, was recorded. Case demographic data and trauma etiology were also recorded. Animal bites accounted for the majority of trauma (71.0%). The most likely bone or region to be fractured was the maxillary bones, followed by the molar region of the mandibles. Up to 37 bones or specific regions were fractured in any given patient, with an average of 8.8 ± 3.1 fractured bones or regions per dog. Rostral mandibular trauma was associated with intra-articular fractures of the temporomandibular joint (p = 0.016). Patients sustained concomitant injuries in 32% of the cases. Muzzle therapy was the main treatment performed for most dogs (53.2%), followed by soft tissue closure (47.9%) and selective dental extractions (27.6%). Healing complications were recorded in 71.6% of the dogs, with malocclusion being the most reported complication (55.2%), and associated with dentate mandibular jaw fractures (p = 0.05). The average number of complications per dog was 2.4. No statistically significant association was found between treatment modality and healing outcome. There was a positive correlation between the severity of fracture fragmentation and displacement and a negative healing outcome (all rho >0.7). Further treatment was required in 55.6% of the dogs. Additional dental extractions were performed in 77.7% of patients. Healing complications were common in the immature CMF trauma case. Thus, the need for a comprehensive assessment of the entire CMF region during the initial visit, as well as follow-up, preferably using CT or cone beam CT, is underscored.",

ANIMALS: 47 client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES: In this retrospective study, 47 dogs had surgery to correct a TTAF before 10 months of age and had the implants left in situ past skeletal maturity. Of these, 42 were followed for a median of 36 months postoperatively. Short- and long-term complications were recorded and compared with historically published data in which the implants were removed within 6 weeks of surgery. RESULTS: 14% (6/42) of our population experienced minor long-term complications (stiffness and lameness), 6% (3/47) experienced major short-term complications (repair failure), and 14% (6/24) experienced major long-term complications (implant removal). There was no difference in long-term outcomes when compared with results of historical reports in which implants were removed 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Client satisfaction was high, with 93% (38/41) grading outcomes as excellent and 95% (39/41) stating they would have surgery performed again in retrospect. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Immature dogs with surgically repaired TTAFs have favorable long-term outcomes when the implants were left in situ past skeletal maturity. Dogs with TTAF repairs may not need implant removal unless it becomes clinically necessary. Avoiding a second procedure will decrease patient morbidity, recovery time, and cost.",

        "abstract": "Although cockatiels are among the most common avian species maintained as companion animals in the United States, information on standard hematologic reference values for this species is limited. The objectives of this study were to establish hematologic reference intervals (RI) for cockatiels, compare methods using both the Natt-Herrick technique (NHT) and the smear-based estimation technique (SBT), explore age and sex differences in the hematologic findings for this species, and produce the first cockatiel RI for fibrinogen concentration and thrombocyte estimate. Healthy cockatiels (60 males and 60 females, 2-11 years old) from a research colony were included in this study. Blood samples were placed in dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes, and erythrocyte counts and thrombocyte estimates were determined via automated analyzer (ADVIA 120) and SBT, respectively. Moreover, leukocyte concentrations were determined using both NHT and SBT to compare these common methods for measuring a complete blood count in cockatiels. Data were analyzed for outliers, distributions, descriptive statistics, and RI via Reference Value Adviser, a set of macroinstructions for Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Lymphocytes were the predominant leukocyte across both methods. According to the NHT, females had significantly higher concentrations of total leukocytes, heterophils, bands, lymphocytes, basophils, and total plasma protein compared with males. Significant inverse polynomial relationships were noted between total leukocyte count and age and lymphocyte counts and age for NHT. Total leukocyte count produced via NHT and SBT were compared using Passing-Bablok and Bland-Altman plots, and no significant constant or proportional biases were found. However, these methods showed wide limits of agreement. While the RI were interchangeable between methods from a clinical standpoint, the same method should be used to assess changes in an individual. The reported RI are uniquely robust given the sample size, balanced sex and age distributions, inclusion criteria, and control over sample collection.",

STUDY DESIGN:  Medical records (October 2016-June 2019) of dog and cat fractures repaired with the LLS were reviewed. Data reviewed included signalment, fracture classification, complications and radiographic outcome. RESULTS:  The LLS was used to repair 60 fractures (57 appendicular and 3 axial) in 54 dogs and 6 cats. Mean time to radiographic union was 6 weeks (range: 4-16). Radiographic union was achieved in all 60 fractures with 55/60 healing without recorded complications. Major complications 4/60 and minor complication 1/60 rates were low and no catastrophic complications occurred. The most common major complication was surgical site infection. CONCLUSION:  The LLS allowed for successful repair in all 60 cases with a wide variety of fractures. The LLS had a similar complication rate and time to radiographic union to that reported in other veterinary locking plate systems. The LLS is a reliable locking plate system which offers some advantages such as a low-profile plate with the ability to place non-polyaxial to angled polyaxial screws, to treat fractures in dogs and cats.",

One prior epidemiologic study on the topic found no association. METHODS: An ecologic evaluation of county-level incidence of lymphomas by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status for the state of California with data obtained from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Synthetic turf field density by county was obtained from the Synthetic Turf Council. During 2000-2013, 7214 14- to 30-year-old Californians were diagnosed with malignant lymphoma. RESULTS: Annual lymphoma county incidence trends were not associated with the county-level synthetic turf field density. None of 20 sub-analyses by race/ethnicity, sex and county median household income indicated a correlation of lymphoma incidence with synthetic turf field density. In California, there was no evidence at the county-level that synthetic turf fields are associated with an increased incidence of lymphoma in adolescents and young adults. CONCLUSION: Our findings in the state with the greatest number of such fields and a large, diverse patient population are consistent with those of a prior study observing no association between individual-level exposures to turf fields and cancer incidence. Avoidance of synthetic turf fields for fear of increased cancer risk is not warranted.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma is one of the most common malignancies during pregnancy. There is debate regarding the impact of pregnancy on the prognosis of melanoma. Recent large population-based studies from the United States are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics and survival of women with pregnancy-associated melanoma. METHODS: This population-based, retrospective cohort study used California Cancer Registry data linked with state-wide hospitalization and ambulatory surgery data to identify 15-44-year-old female patients diagnosed with melanoma in 1994-2015, including pregnant patients. Multivariable logistic regression compared demographic and clinical characteristics between pregnant and non-pregnant women with melanoma. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression models assessed melanoma-specific and overall survival. RESULTS: We identified 13 108 patients, of which 1406 were pregnant. Pregnancy-associated melanoma was more frequent in Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White women. Melanoma occurring post-partum was associated with greater tumour thickness (2.01-4.00 vs. 0.01-1.00 mm, odds ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.98). There were otherwise no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. Worse survival was associated with Asian, Black and Native American race/ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic White), lower neighbourhood socio-economic status, public insurance, tumour site, greater tumour thickness and lymph node involvement, but not pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma occurring post-partum was associated with greater tumour thickness, but pregnancy status did not affect survival after melanoma. Race/ethnicity, socio-economic status and health insurance impacted survival, emphasizing the importance of reducing health disparities.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Engagement of patients in their care can lead to better health outcomes, especially for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors who experience mental and physical illnesses more often than noncancer adults. We examined how patient engagement in care influences health care expenses and use. Methods: AYA cancer survivors (n = 1162) and a comparison group of matched adults with no history of cancer (n = 2954) were identified from the 2011 to 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. Medical expenditures and health care utilization associated with shared decision-making (SDM) measured by a self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Clinician and Group (CAHPS-CG) survey were evaluated using multivariable regression models. Results: AYA cancer survivors were more likely to report poor SDM compared with adults with no history of cancer (odds ratio = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]): 1.06 to 1.62). AYA cancer survivors with poor SDM were more likely to report poor mental and physical health compared with AYAs with good SDM. AYA cancer survivors with poor SDM had $3037 (CI: $110 to $7032) in additional annual medical expenses and 4.86 (CI: 2.00 to 8.52) in additional office visits compared with AYA cancer survivors with optimal SDM, even after adjusting for chronic conditions and psychological distress. Conclusion: Our results highlight the substantial economic burden associated with poor SDM in AYA cancer survivors. Our research suggests that interventions to improve SDM in AYA cancer survivors may contribute to patients' positive perception of their health and result in AYAs seeking fewer medical services resulting in lower medical expenses.",

We assessed the frequency of TRTs, length of stay (LOS), admission rates associated with TRTs and TRTs impact on survival. Febrile neutropenia, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia were the most common TRTs for both children and AYAs. AYAs had longer median LOS compared to children for most toxicities. AYAs at non-specialized cancer centers (SCCs) had higher frequency of admissions associated with TRTs compared to non-SCC. Cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, and infectious TRTs were associated with worse survival. This study demonstrates the burden of TRTs in patients with ALL.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are associated with inferior health outcomes among cancer survivors, including increased mortality. It is crucial to identify vulnerable subgroups, yet investigations have been limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with risky health behaviors among cancer survivors. METHODS: We used national, cross-sectional survey data (Health Information National Trends Survey, HINTS 2017-2020) for 2579 cancer survivors. We calculated the prevalence of risky alcohol use, current cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and not meeting physical activity guidelines. We performed weighted logistic regression to obtain multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the association between each unhealthy behavior with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 25% showed risky alcohol use, 12% were current cigarette smokers, 3% were current e-cigarette users, and 68% did not meet physical activity guidelines. Cancer survivors who were males, non-Hispanic Whites or African Americans, without a college education, not married and with comorbidities or psychological distress were more likely to have unhealthy behaviors. Those with lung disease or depression were 2 times as likely to smoke cigarette or e-cigarettes and those with psychological distress were 1.6 times as likely to be physically inactive. Moreover, risky drinkers (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.22-2.52) and e-cigarette smokers (OR = 16.40, 95% CI 3.29-81.89) were more likely to be current cigarette smokers. CONCLUSIONS: We identified vulnerable subpopulations of cancer survivors with multiple unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our findings inform clinicians and program and policy makers of the subgroups of cancer survivors to target for multiple health behavior interventions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Older men with the worse alignment of activity and light may have lower levels of cognition and increased rates of cognitive decline. METHODS: This cohort consisted of 1 036 older men (81.1 ± 4.6 years) from the MrOS Sleep Study (2009-2012). Light and activity levels were gathered by wrist actigraphy. Phasor analysis was used to quantify the alignment of light-dark and rest-activity patterns (magnitude) and their temporal relationship (angle). Global cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental State examination [3MS]) and executive function (Trails B test) were measured, then repeated 4.2 ± 0.8 years later. Linear regression models examined the associations of phasor magnitude and angle with cognition and cognitive decline. Models were adjusted for age, clinic, race, education, and season. RESULTS: Smaller phasor magnitude (worse aligned light and activity patterns) was associated with lower initial level and increased decline in executive function. Compared to those with higher phasor magnitude, those with lower magnitude took an average of 11.1 seconds longer to complete the Trails B test (quartile 1 vs quartile 4, p = .02). After follow-up, Trails B completion time increased an average of 5.5 seconds per standard deviation decrease in phasor magnitude (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-10.4, p = .03). There were no associations with phasor angle, and none with magnitude and global cognition (3MS). CONCLUSION: Among older men, worse alignment of light and activity patterns was associated with worse initial performance and increased decline in executive function, but not related to global cognition. Interventions that improve the alignment of light and activity may slow cognitive decline in older adults.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain, a possible marker of central sensitization, is associated with higher prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among older men. We investigated whether musculoskeletal pain is associated with LUTS progression. METHODS: Participants were 5 569 men age ≥65 years enrolled in the prospective, multicenter Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study. Self-reported musculoskeletal pain within 12 months before baseline was categorized as any pain and multilocation pain. Pain interference within 4 weeks of baseline was assessed with the SF-12 questionnaire. LUTS were assessed repeatedly with the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI). Men with severe LUTS at baseline were excluded. LUTS progression was defined as the first occurrence of a ≥4-point AUA-SI increase during a 2-year follow-up interval. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable pooled logistic regression. RESULTS: LUTS progression was 37% higher among men with any musculoskeletal pain compared with men without pain (IRR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.54). Positive associations were also observed between LUTS progression and pain at 1 (IRR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.48) and ≥2 locations (IRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.60). Compared with men without pain interference, men with quite a bit/extreme pain interference were most likely to experience LUTS progression (minimal interference IRR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.26; moderate interference IRR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.45; quite a bit/extreme interference IRR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.71). CONCLUSIONS: Among men initially without severe LUTS, musculoskeletal pain is associated with an increased risk of LUTS progression. Studies using validated measures of central sensitization and LUTS progression among men are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Microgravity-induced bone loss is a main obstacle for long term space missions as it is difficult to maintain bone mass when loading stimuli is reduced. With a typical bone mineral density loss of 1.5% per month of microgravity exposure, the chances for osteoporosis and fractures may endanger astronauts' health. Parathyroid Hormone or PTH (1-34) is an FDA approved treatment for osteoporosis, and may reverse microgravity-induced bone loss. However, PTH proteins requires refrigeration, daily subcutaneous injection, and have a short shelf-life, limiting its use in a resource-limited environment, like space. In this study, PTH was produced in an Fc-fusion form via transient expression in plants, to improve the circulatory half-life which reduces dosing frequency and to simplify purification if needed. Plant-based expression is well-suited for space medicine application given its low resource consumption and short expression timeline. The PTH-Fc accumulation profile in plant was established with a peak expression on day 5 post infiltration of 373 ± 59 mg/kg leaf fresh weight. Once the PTH-Fc was purified, the amino acid sequence and the binding affinity to its target, PTH 1 receptor (PTH1R), was determined utilizing biolayer interferometry (BLI). The binding affinity between PTH-Fc and PTH1R was 2.30 × 10-6 M, similar to the affinity between PTH (1-34) and PTH1R (2.31 × 10-6 M). Its function was also confirmed in a cell-based receptor stimulation assay, where PTH-Fc was able to stimulate the PTH1R producing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with an EC50 of (8.54 ± 0.12) x 10-9 M, comparable to the EC50 from the PTH (1-34) of 1.49 × 10-8 M. These results suggest that plant recombinant PTH-Fc exhibits a similar binding affinity and potency in a PTH1R activation assay compared to PTH. Furthermore, it can be produced rapidly at high levels with minimal resources and reagents, making it ideal for production in low resource environments such as space.",

The boosted resonance is reconstructed as a single wide jet with substructure consistent with a two-body decay. The high-mass resonance is thus considered as a dijet system. The jet substructure information and the kinematic properties of cascade resonance decays are exploited to disentangle the signal from the large quantum chromodynamics multijet background. The dijet mass spectrum is analyzed for the presence of new high-mass resonances, and is found to be consistent with the standard model background predictions. Results are interpreted in a warped extra dimension model where the high-mass resonance is a Kaluza–Klein gluon, the boosted resonance is a radion, and the final state partons are all gluons. Limits on the production cross section are set as a function of the Kaluza–Klein gluon and radion masses. These limits exclude at 95% confidence level models with Kaluza–Klein gluon masses in the range 2.0 to 4.3 TeV and radion masses in the range 0.20 to 0.74 TeV. By exploring a novel experimental signature, the observed limits on the Kaluza–Klein gluon mass are extended by up to about 1 TeV compared to previous searches.",

        "abstract": "A search for new heavy resonances decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons (HH) in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented. Data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016–2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1. Resonances with a mass between 0.8 and 4.5 TeV are considered using events in which one Higgs boson decays into a bottom quark pair and the other into final states with either one or two charged leptons. Specifically, the single-lepton decay channel HH→ b b ¯ WW∗→ b b ¯ ℓvq q ¯ ′ and the dilepton decay channels HH→ b b ¯ WW∗→ b b ¯ ℓvℓv and HH→ b b ¯ ττ→ b b ¯ ℓvvℓvv are examined, where ℓ in the final state corresponds to an electron or muon. The signal is extracted using a two-dimensional maximum likelihood fit of the H → b b ¯ jet mass and HH invariant mass distributions. No significant excess above the standard model expectation is observed in data. Model-independent exclusion limits are placed on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for narrow spin-0 and spin-2 massive bosons decaying to HH. The results are also interpreted in the context of radion and bulk graviton production in models with a warped extra spatial dimension. The results provide the most stringent limits to date for X → HH signatures with final-state leptons and at some masses provide the most sensitive limits of all X → HH searches.

The search uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb−1 collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The search is motivated by models of supersymmetry that predict the production of neutralinos, the neutral partners of the electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons. The observed event yields in the signal regions are found to be consistent with the standard model background expectations. The results are interpreted using simplified models of supersymmetry. For the electroweak production of nearly mass-degenerate higgsinos, each of whose decay chains yields a neutralino (χ~10) that in turn decays to a massless goldstino and a Higgs boson, (χ~10) masses in the range 175 to 1025 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. For the strong production of gluino pairs decaying via a slightly lighter (χ~20) to H and a light (χ~10), gluino masses below 2330 GeV are excluded. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, detailed studies of its properties have been ongoing. Besides its mass, its width—related to its lifetime—is an important parameter. One way to determine this quantity is to measure its off-shell production, where the Higgs boson mass is far away from its nominal value, and relating it to its on-shell production, where the mass is close to the nominal value. Here we report evidence for such off-shell contributions to the production cross-section of two Z bosons with data from the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We constrain the total rate of the off-shell Higgs boson contribution beyond the Z boson pair production threshold, relative to its standard model expectation, to the interval [0.0061, 2.0] at the 95% confidence level. The scenario with no off-shell contribution is excluded at a p-value of 0.0003 (3.6 standard deviations). We measure the width of the Higgs boson as ΓH=3.2−1.7+2.4MeV, in agreement with the standard model expectation of 4.1 MeV. In addition, we set constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings to W and Z boson pairs.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral white matter hyperintensities on MRI are markers of cerebral small vessel disease, a major risk factor for dementia and stroke. Despite the successful identification of multiple genetic variants associated with this highly heritable condition, its genetic architecture remains incompletely understood. More specifically, the role of DNA methylation has received little attention. We investigated the association between white matter hyperintensity burden and DNA methylation in blood at ∼450 000 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in 9732 middle-aged to older adults from 14 community-based studies. Single CpG and region-based association analyses were carried out. Functional annotation and integrative cross-omics analyses were performed to identify novel genes underlying the relationship between DNA methylation and white matter hyperintensities. We identified 12 single CpG and 46 region-based DNA methylation associations with white matter hyperintensity burden. Our top discovery single CpG, cg24202936 (P = 7.6 × 10-8), was associated with F2 expression in blood (P = 6.4 × 10-5) and co-localized with FOLH1 expression in brain (posterior probability = 0.75). Our top differentially methylated regions were in PRMT1 and in CCDC144NL-AS1, which were also represented in single CpG associations (cg17417856 and cg06809326, respectively). Through Mendelian randomization analyses cg06809326 was putatively associated with white matter hyperintensity burden (P = 0.03) and expression of CCDC144NL-AS1 possibly mediated this association. Differentially methylated region analysis, joint epigenetic association analysis and multi-omics co-localization analysis consistently identified a role of DNA methylation near SH3PXD2A, a locus previously identified in genome-wide association studies of white matter hyperintensities. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed functions of the identified DNA methylation loci in the blood-brain barrier and in the immune response. Integrative cross-omics analysis identified 19 key regulatory genes in two networks related to extracellular matrix organization, and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. A drug-repositioning analysis indicated antihyperlipidaemic agents, more specifically peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, as possible target drugs for white matter hyperintensities. Our epigenome-wide association study and integrative cross-omics analyses implicate novel genes influencing white matter hyperintensity burden, which converged on pathways related to the immune response and to a compromised blood-brain barrier possibly due to disrupted cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The results also suggest that antihyperlipidaemic therapy may contribute to lowering risk for white matter hyperintensities possibly through protection against blood-brain barrier disruption.",

        "abstract": "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder present with difficulties in social communication, restricted interests or behaviors and other co-morbidities. About 2 to 10% of cases of autism have a genetic cause, and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is reported in 0 to 6.5% of individuals with autism. However, the FXS and premutation prevalence among Filipino children has never been reported. The aim of the study was to establish the presence of FXS or premutation carriers among Filipino children with autism and to describe the phenotypic characteristic of cases identified. Blood was collected from 235 children aged 2-6 years old and diagnosed with autism. Samples were analyzed using PCR methods to amplify CGG repeats in the FMRI gene. The diagnosis of autism was confirmed through the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2. Additional characteristics were documented from a physical examination, Griffiths Scales of Child Development assessment and a parent-answered questionnaire using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Fragile X testing through PCR methods in 235 children with diagnosed autism showed 220 (93.6%) were negative, no full mutations, 1 (0.436%) premutation carrier and 14 (5.95%) cases contained intermediate alleles. The FXS testing was limited to confirmed cases of autism, which is considered a high-risk group and does not provide prevalence for the general Filipino population. Subjects were self-referred or referred by clinicians, which may not represent the Filipino autism population with a bias towards those with means for clinical consultations and ability to travel to the place of testing. Samples were not measured for mosaicism, DNA methylation or AGG interspersion patterns. These may have effects on the CGG repeat expansion and overall presentation of FXS. Findings from a single premutation carrier cannot characterize features distinctly present in Filipinos with the mutation. Nevertheless, these results support the data that the prevalence of FXS in Asian populations may be lower than non-Asian populations. This can contribute to a better understanding of FXS and genetic causes of autism in the Philippines and other Asian populations.",

Phenotypically, individuals with FXS also present with distinct physical features including, elongated face, prominent ears, pectus excavatum, macroorchidism, and joint laxity, which suggests connective tissue dysplasia. In addition to mitral valve prolapse, aortic dilatation has been identified within individuals with FXS. Abnormal elastin fiber networks have been found in the skin, valves, and aorta in individual cases. Aortic dilatation has been described in other connective tissue disorders, particularly Marfan syndrome. However, while aortic aneurysms are characteristic of Marfan syndrome, no similar cases have been reported in FXS patients to date. This case report details the presentation of two patients with FXS and aortic aneurysm. Our two cases highlight the risks of aortic pathology in FXS, and the need for monitoring in asymptomatic patients with significant aortic dilatation.",

PURPOSE: Provide initial validation of a revised version of the FXTAS-RS for motor signs. METHOD: We conducted a two-phase mixed-method approach. In Phase 1, revision, we implemented a Delphi technique identifying pertinent domains/subdomains and developing items through expert consensus. In Phase 2, content validation, we conducted cognitive pretesting assessing comprehensibility, comprehensiveness, and relevance of items to FXTAS motor signs. RESULTS: After five rounds of Delphi panel and two rounds of cognitive pretesting, the revised version of the FXTAS-RS was established with 18 items covering five domains and 13 subdomains of motor signs. Cognitive pretesting revealed adequate content validity for the assessment of FXTAS motor signs. CONCLUSION: The revised FXTAS-RS has been successfully validated for content and it is now ready for large-scale field validation.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study examined relationships among family characteristics, caregiver change in use of strategies, and child growth in spoken language over the course of a parent-implemented language intervention (PILI) that was developed to address some of the challenges associated with the fragile X syndrome (FXS) phenotype. METHOD: Participants were 43 parent-child dyads from two different PILI studies, both of which taught parents various language facilitation strategies to support child language. Before starting the intervention, parents reported on their mental health, parenting stress, and parenting competence. This study focused on potential barriers to treatment gains by examining correlations between the measures of parent well-being and (a) parent change in use of intervention strategies taught in the PILI and (b) changes in child language outcomes from preto post-intervention. RESULTS: Parents in this study had elevated mental health symptoms across several domains and increased rates of parenting stress. Furthermore, although PILI resulted in treatment gains for both parents and children, a variety of parent mental health symptoms were found to be significantly and negatively associated with change in use of strategies and growth in child language over the course of the intervention. Some inconsistent findings also emerged regarding the relationships between parenting stress and competence and change in parent strategy use and growth in child language. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that parents who are experiencing significant mental health challenges may have a more difficult time participating fully in PILIs and that there may be subsequent effects on child outcomes. Future PILIs could benefit from addressing parent well-being as a substantial part of the intervention program.",

Input included co-occurring behavioral conditions, sleep and sensory problems, autistic behavior scales (SCQ, SRS-2), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist revised for FXS (ABCFX). A 5-class solution yielded the most clinically meaningful, pharmacotherapy independent behavioral groups with distinctive SCQ, SRS-2, and ABCFX profiles, and adequate non-overlap (≥ 71%): \"Mild\" (31%), \"Moderate without Social Impairment\" (32%), \"Moderate with Social Impairment\" (7%), \"Moderate with Disruptive Behavior\" (20%), and \"Severe\" (9%).

In the first analysis of its kind at this resolution, we jointly infer the lens model parameters and pixellated radio source surface brightness. We consider several lens models of increasing complexity, starting from an elliptical power-law density profile. We extend this model to include angular multipole structures, a separate stellar mass component, additional nearby field galaxies, and/or a generic external potential. We compare these models using their relative Bayesian log-evidence (Bayes factor). We find strong evidence for angular structure in the lens; our best model is comprised of a power-law profile plus multipole perturbations and external potential, with a Bayes factor of +14984 relative to the elliptical power-law model. It is noteworthy that the elliptical power-law mass distribution is a remarkably good fit on its own, with additional model complexity correcting the deflection angles only at the ∼5 mas level. We also consider the effects of added complexity in the lens model on time-delay cosmography and flux-ratio analyses. We find that an overly simplistic power-law ellipsoid lens model can bias the measurement of H0 by ∼3 per cent and mimic flux ratio anomalies of ∼8 per cent. Our results demonstrate the power of high-resolution VLBI observations to provide strong constraints on the inner density profiles of lens galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational time delays provide a powerful one-step measurement of H0, independent of all other probes. One key ingredient in time-delay cosmography are high-accuracy lens models. Those are currently expensive to obtain, both, in terms of computing and investigator time (105-106 CPU hours and ∼0.5-1 yr, respectively). Major improvements in modelling speed are therefore necessary to exploit the large number of lenses that are forecast to be discovered over the current decade. In order to bypass this roadblock, we develop an automated modelling pipeline and apply it to a sample of 31 lens systems, observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in multiple bands. Our automated pipeline can derive models for 30/31 lenses with few hours of human time and <100 CPU hours of computing time for a typical system. For each lens, we provide measurements of key parameters and predictions of magnification as well as time delays for the multiple images. We characterize the cosmography-readiness of our models using the stability of differences in the Fermat potential (proportional to time delay) with respect to modelling choices. We find that for 10/30 lenses, our models are cosmography or nearly cosmography grade (<3 per cent and 3-5 per cent variations). For 6/30 lenses, the models are close to cosmography grade (5-10 per cent). These results utilize informative priors and will need to be confirmed by further analysis. However, they are also likely to improve by extending the pipeline modelling sequence and options. In conclusion, we show that uniform cosmography grade modelling of large strong lens samples is within reach.",

        "abstract": "We have measured the redshifts and single-aperture velocity dispersions of eight lens galaxies using the data collected by the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) and Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) at W.M. Keck observatory on different observing nights spread over three years (2018-2020). These results, combined with other ancillary data, such as high-resolution images of the lens systems, and time delays, are necessary to increase the sample size of the quasar-galaxy lens systems for which the Hubble constant can be measured, using the time-delay strong lensing method, hence increasing the precision of its inference. Typically, the 2D spectra of the quasar-galaxy lens systems get spatially blended due to seeing by ground-based observations. As a result, the extracted lensing galaxy (deflector) spectra become significantly contaminated by quasar light, which affects the ability to extract meaningful information about the deflector. To account for spatial blending and extract less contaminated and higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) 1D spectra of the deflectors, a forward modeling method has been implemented. From the extracted spectra, we have measured redshifts using prominent absorption lines and single aperture velocity dispersions using the penalized pixel fitting code pPXF. In this paper, we report the redshifts and single aperture velocity dispersions of eight lens galaxies -J0147+4630, B0445+123, B0631+519, J0659+1629, J0818-2613, J0924+0219, J1433+6007, and J1817+2729. Among these systems, six do not have previously measured velocity dispersions; for the other two, our measurements are consistent with previously reported values. Additionally, we have measured the previously unknown redshifts of the deflectors in J0818-2613 and J1817+2729 to be 0.866 ± 0.002 and 0.408 ± 0.002, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Strong-lensing time delays enable the measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) independently of other traditional methods. The main limitation to the precision of time-delay cosmography is mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD). Some of the previous TDCOSMO analyses broke the MSD by making standard assumptions about the mass density profile of the lens galaxy, reaching 2% precision from seven lenses. However, this approach could potentially bias the H0 measurement or underestimate the errors. For this work, we broke the MSD for the first time using spatially resolved kinematics of the lens galaxy in RXJ1131-1231 obtained from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy, in combination with previously published time delay and lens models derived from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. This approach allowed us to robustly estimate H0, effectively implementing a maximally flexible mass model. Following a blind analysis, we estimated the angular diameter distance to the lens galaxy Dd=865-81+85 Mpc and the time-delay distance Dδ t=2180-271+472 Mpc, giving H0=77.1-7.1+7.3 km s-1 Mpc-1 -for a flat δcold dark matter cosmology. The error budget accounts for all uncertainties, including the MSD inherent to the lens mass profile and line-of-sight effects, and those related to the mass-anisotropy degeneracy and projection effects. Our new measurement is in excellent agreement with those obtained in the past using standard simply parametrized mass profiles for this single system (H0=78.3-3.3+3.4 km s-1 Mpc-1) and for seven lenses (H0=74.2-1.6+1.6 km s-1 Mpc-1), or for seven lenses using single-aperture kinematics and the same maximally flexible models used by us (H0=73.3-5.8+5.8 km s-1 Mpc-1). This agreement corroborates the methodology of time-delay cosmography.",

        "abstract": "In most Asian countries, farmers have smallholdings ranging from one to two hectares. The tractor-mounted boom sprayers cannot practically be used in small size farms with divided plots and complex terrain. To cope with these issues, a prototype self-propelled crop sprayer was developed, including a 20-hp engine, 300 L liquid tank, and hydraulically-controlled spray boom with eight hollow cone nozzles. The spray symmetry of the hollow cone nozzle was evaluated under four pressures (2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 bar) in the laboratory. The operating parameters of the sprayer, such as forward speed (4, 6, and 8 km h−1), spray height (40, 55, and 70 cm), and pressure (3, 5, and 7 bar) were optimized by measuring three spray characteristics including droplet density, coverage percentage, and Volume Median Diameter (VMD) in the cotton field. The results revealed that the nozzle spray was symmetrical at 2.5 and 3 bar pressure as the R2 value was higher than 0.96. The field test result showed that in all treatments, treatments T14 (6 km h−1, 55 cm, 5 bar) and T22 (8 km h−1, 55 cm, 3 bar) were suitable for spraying medium-to-low concentration solution (post-emergence herbicides and fungicides) and high concentration solution (insecticides and pre-emergence herbicides), respectively. The spray characteristics at treatments T14 and T22 were 64.7 droplets cm−2, 26.7%, 230 µm, and 39 droplets cm−2, 14.9%, and 219.8 µm respectively. The field efficiency of the sprayer was 61%. The spraying cost per unit area was 55–64% less compared to manual labor cost. In conclusion, a prototype self-propelled crop sprayer is an efficient and environment-friendly technology for small farms. Operating the sprayer at the optimal parameters also saves operational costs and time.",

It has been hypothesized that many youth-related ATV incidents occur because children ride ATVs that do not fit their capabilities and are not following basic safe riding practices. In addition, various ATV safety guidelines regarding youth (e.g., CPSC, ANSI/SVIA, ASI) are inconsistent and may not align with state or local laws. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have compared the physical and mental requirements for riding ATVs and the youth's capabilities to ride ATVs safely. Consequently, there are no scientific-based recommendations for age limitation, physical and mental capabilities, and safety requirements for youth to ride ATVs safely. Thus, there is a need to review the available sources related to youth safety and ATVs in the agricultural industry, identify the research voids, and recommend modifications to current ATV guidelines. This study conducted a systematic review of available ATV-related studies, standards, guidelines, and laws to establish better-informed minimum age, physical and mental capabilities, and safety requirements for youths to ride ATVs on the farm.",

        "abstract": "PROBLEM: Utility All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) are one major cause of youth injuries and fatalities on farms. Utility ATVs have heavy weights and fast speeds that require complex maneuvering. Youth's physical capabilities may not be sufficient to perform those complex maneuvers correctly. Therefore, it is hypothesized that most youth engage in ATV-related incidents because they ride vehicles unfit for them. There is a need to assess ATV-youth fit based on youth anthropometry. METHOD: This study focused on evaluating potential inconsistencies between the operational requirements of utility ATVs and the anthropometric measures of youth through virtual simulations. Virtual simulations were performed to assess 11 youth-ATV fit guidelines proposed by several ATV safety advocacy organizations (National 4-H council, CPSC, IPCH, and FReSH). In total, 17 utility ATVs along with male-and-female-youth of nine ages (8 to 16 years old) and three height percentiles (5th, 50th, and 95th) were evaluated. RESULTS: The results demonstrated a physical mismatch between ATVs' operational requirements and youth's anthropometry. For example, male-youth aged 16 of the 95th height percentile failed to pass at least 1 out of the 11 fit guidelines for 35 % of all vehicles evaluated. The results were even more concerning for females. Female youth 10 years old and younger (from all height percentiles) failed to pass at least one fit guideline for all ATVs evaluated. DISCUSSION: Youth are not recommended to ride utility ATVs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study provides quantitative and systematic evidence to modify current ATV safety guidelines. Furthermore, youth occupational health professionals could use the present findings to prevent ATV-related incidents in agricultural settings.",

It is hypothesised that youth are involved in ATV-related incidents because they cannot effectively activate the vehicle's controls. This study evaluated potential discrepancies between the required activation forces of the controls of fifty-four utility ATVs and the strength of male-and-female youth of varying ages (6-20 years old) and strength percentiles (5th, 50th, and 95th). The activation forces of the ATVs' controls were measured experimentally, while the youth's corresponding strength was retrieved from the literature. The results of this study demonstrated a physical mismatch between the forces required to operate ATV controls and youth's strength. Turning the handlebar, pressing the footbrake, and pushing the ATV off are the most difficult tasks for ATV operation. These discrepancies compromise the youth's ability to ride ATVs, increasing their risk of crashes. Practitioner summary: Previous studies indicate that some youth engage in ATV incidents because they cannot activate the vehicle's controls. We measured the forces required to operate eight ATV controls and compared them with the youth's corresponding strength. Our results demonstrated physical mismatches between the forces required to operate ATV controls and the youth's strength.",

        "abstract": "HIGHLIGHTS: Previous quad bike educational interventions focused solely on operator behavior, leading to positive shifts in 'safety knowledge' but very little change in actual rider behavior. Discussions in a recent virtual ATV Safety Symposium hosted by the University of California-Davis (2022) emphasized building agricultural community awareness of quad bike engineering controls-particularly in the U.S. and other nations. Outreach specialists in agriculture should begin to prioritize more discussion of quad bike engineering controls in training programs. ABSTRACT: To date, most quad bike educational programs have featured an operator-focused approach, focusing on adherence to administrative controls, personal responsibility, and personal protective equipment. Though these programs lead to shifts in 'safety knowledge', they result in very little change in actual rider behavior. In this perspectives article, we highlight discussions from a recent ATV Safety Symposium and USDA-NIFA review of agricultural ATV safety in the U.S. that highlight the dire need for building agricultural community awareness of quad bike engineering controls such as CPDs, wider and more stable frame designs, and others. Although CPDs were introduced 15 years ago, we continue to observe low awareness of this and other important quad bike safety features among young adults in agriculture. We believe that it will be critical to apply some of the recommendations outlined in this article to improve future outreach programs focused on quad bike safety for agricultural occupational use. If rural, agricultural communities learn to accept and respect these life-saving technologies, future standards, policies, and legislative actions are more likely to be well-received.",

        "issued": "2018-05",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The investigation aimed to compare two approaches to the delivery of care for hospitalized injury survivors, a patient-centered care transition intervention versus enhanced usual care. METHOD: This pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial randomized 171 acutely injured trauma survivors with three or more early postinjury concerns and high levels of emotional distress to intervention (I; n = 85) and enhanced usual care control (C; n = 86) conditions. The care transition intervention components included care management that elicited and targeted improvement in patients' postinjury concerns, 24/7 study team cell phone accessibility, and stepped-up care. Posttraumatic concerns, symptomatic distress, functional status, and statewide emergency department (ED) service utilization were assessed at baseline and over the course of the 12 months after injury. Regression analyses assessed intervention and control group outcome differences over time. RESULTS: Over 80% patient follow-up was attained at each time point. Intervention patients demonstrated clinically and statistically significant reductions in the percentage of any severe postinjury concerns expressed when compared to controls longitudinally (Wald chi-square = 11.29, p = 0.01) and at the six-month study time point (C = 74%, I = 53%; Fisher's exact test, p = 0.02). Comparisons of ED utilization data yielded clinically significant cross-sectional differences (one or more three- to six-month ED visits; C = 30.2%, I = 16.5%, [relative risk (95% confidence interval] C versus I = 2.00 (1.09, 3.70), p = 0.03) that did not achieve longitudinal statistical significance (F (3, 507) = 2.24, p = 0.08). The intervention did not significantly impact symptomatic or functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Orchestrated investigative and policy efforts should continue to evaluate patient-centered care transition interventions to inform American College of Surgeons' clinical guidelines for U.S. trauma care systems.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: To date, few multisite investigations have evaluated early interventions for injured patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To simultaneously assess the effectiveness and implementation of a brief stepped collaborative care intervention targeting PTSD and comorbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted at 25 US level I trauma centers. Participants included hospitalized survivors of physical injury who underwent a 2-step evaluation for PTSD symptoms. Patients reporting high levels of distress on the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C) were randomized (N = 635) per the stepped-wedge protocol to enhanced usual care control (n = 370) or intervention (n = 265) conditions. The study was conducted from January 4, 2016, through November 2018. Data analysis was performed from November 4, 2019, to December 8, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The Trauma Survivors Outcomes and Support collaborative care intervention included proactive injury case management that assisted patients transitioning from hospital inpatient to outpatient and community settings. The intervention also integrated evidence-based pharmacotherapy and psychotherapeutic elements targeting PTSD symptoms and comorbidity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcome was PTSD symptoms assessed with the PCL-C at baseline in the surgical ward and at 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Secondary outcomes included depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and physical function. Subgroup analyses examined the effect of baseline risk factors for enduring PTSD and quality of protocol implementation on study outcomes. Primary statistical analyses were conducted using the intent-to-treat sample. RESULTS: A total of 327 men (51.5%) were included in analysis; mean (SD) age was 39.0 (14.2) years. The investigation attained follow-up of 75% to 80% of the participants at 3 to 12 months. The intervention lasted a mean (SD) of 122 (132) minutes. Mixed model regression analyses revealed statistically significant changes in PCL-C scores for intervention patients compared with control patients at 6 months (difference, -2.57; 95% CI, -5.12 to -0.03; effect size, 0.18; P < .05) but not 12 months (difference, -1.27; 95% CI, -4.26 to 1.73; effect size, 0.08; P = .35). Subgroup analyses revealed larger PTSD treatment effects for patients with 3 or more baseline risk factors for enduring PTSD and for patients, including firearm injury survivors, treated at trauma centers with good or excellent protocol implementation. Intervention effects for secondary outcomes did not attain statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A brief stepped collaborative care intervention was associated with significant 6-month but not 12-month PTSD symptom reductions. Greater baseline PTSD risk and good or excellent trauma center protocol implementation were associated with larger PTSD treatment effects. Orchestrated efforts targeting policy and funding should systematically incorporate the study findings into national trauma center requirements and verification criteria.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2016 report on the trauma care system recommended establishing a National Trauma Research Action Plan to strengthen and guide future trauma research. To address this recommendation, the Department of Defense funded a study to generate a comprehensive research agenda spanning the trauma and burn care continuum. Panels were created to conduct a gap analysis and identify high-priority research questions. The National Trauma Research Action Plan panel reported here addressed trauma systems and informatics. METHODS: Experts were recruited to identify current gaps in trauma systems research, generate research questions, and establish the priorities using an iterative Delphi survey approach from November 2019 through August 2020. Panelists were identified to ensure heterogeneity and generalizability, including military and civilian representation. Panelists were encouraged to use a PICO format to generate research questions: patient/population, intervention, compare/control, and outcome. In subsequent surveys, panelists prioritized each research question on a 9-point Likert scale, categorized as low-, medium-, and high-priority items. Consensus was defined as ≥60% agreement. RESULTS: Twenty-seven subject matter experts generated 570 research questions, of which 427 (75%) achieved the consensus threshold. Of the consensus reaching questions, 209 (49%) were rated high priority, 213 (50%) medium priority, and 5 (1%) low priority. Gaps in understanding the broad array of interventions were identified, including those related to health care infrastructure, technology products, education/training, resuscitation, and operative intervention. The prehospital phase of care was highlighted as an area needing focused research. CONCLUSION: This Delphi gap analysis of trauma systems and informatics research identified high-priority research questions that will help guide investigators and funding agencies in setting research priorities to continue to work toward Zero Preventable Deaths after trauma.

This cross-sectional survey study aims to evaluate factors associated with WLB in trauma surgeons, stratified by gender. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis, studying gender, of a AAST survey evaluating predictors of WLB in trauma surgeons. Survey topics include demographics, clinical practice, family, lifestyle, and emotional support. Subgroups were analyzed independently; primary outcome was WLB satisfaction. RESULTS: 292 AAST members completed the survey. Responses were stratified by gender (29% females, 71% males). Independent predictors of WLB satisfaction are: Females: more awake hours at home, having a job well-suited for them, better about meeting deadlines. Males: comfortable declining new tasks, fair compensation, healthy diet, workplace emotional support. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with WLB satisfaction in trauma surgeons are different based on gender. This information may help trauma surgeons mitigate burnout.",

        "abstract": "Fatality Analysis Reporting System (PARS) data was analyzed for all US states and the District of Columbia. The analysis was limited to front seat occupants aged 15 to 74, involved in motor vehicle crashes between the dates of 1/1/79 and 12/31/95 who received trauma care at any level. Following an adjustment for age distribution of the population, overall crash mortality decreased by 22% between during the time frame studied. Utilizing the 1993 Inventory of Trauma Systems coupled with a survey that further defined components of a trauma system, the authors identified 22 states that had designated trauma centers and triage policies enforced by legislation. The first year of state trauma center designation was regarded as the year of trauma system implementation. The 22 states identified as having trauma systems had an additional 8% reduction (30% total reduction) during the same time interval. Additionally, 18 of the 22 states with trauma systems had a statistically significant reduction in crash mortality following trauma system implementation. Although the authors state that the initiation of a trauma system had litde or no effect on aggregate crash mortality data during the first 10 years of system development, regression analysis suggests that, after approximately 13 years, the continued projected decrease in crash mortality becomes statistically significant. Because studies had previously related primary or secondary restraint laws, license revocation related to driving under the influence, and speed limits exceeding 55 mph to crash mortality rates, these were considered as possible confounding variables during data analysis. This article supports the conclusions of previous studies supporting the introduction of seat belt, speed limit, and DUI legislation. Data analysis revealed a 13% crash mortality decrease after the enactment of primary seat belt laws or strict DUI regulations. Additionally, states with speed limits exceeding 55 mph were associated with 7% higher crash mortality. © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of rivipansel, a predominantly E-selectin antagonist, were studied in a phase 3, randomized, controlled trial for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) requiring hospitalization (RESET). A total of 345 subjects (204 adults and 141 children) were randomized and 320 were treated (162 with rivipansel, 158 with placebo) with an IV loading dose, followed by up to 14 additional 12-hourly maintenance doses of rivipansel or placebo, in addition to standard care. Rivipansel was similarly administered during subsequent VOCs in the Open-label Extension (OLE) study. In the full analysis population, the median time to readiness for discharge (TTRFD), the primary end point, was not different between rivipansel and placebo (-5.7 hours, P = .79; hazard ratio, 0.97), nor were differences seen in secondary end points of time to discharge (TTD), time to discontinuation of IV opioids (TTDIVO), and cumulative IV opioid use. Mean soluble E-selectin decreased 61% from baseline after the loading dose in the rivipansel group, while remaining unchanged in the placebo group. In a post hoc analysis, early rivipansel treatment within 26.4 hours of VOC pain onset (earliest quartile of time from VOC onset to treatment) reduced median TTRFD by 56.3 hours, reduced median TTD by 41.5 hours, and reduced median TTDIVO by 50.5 hours, compared with placebo (all P < .05). A similar subgroup analysis comparing OLE early-treatment with early-treatment RESET placebo showed a reduction in TTD of 23.1 hours (P = .062) and in TTDIVO of 30.1 hours (P = .087). Timing of rivipansel administration after pain onset may be critical to achieving accelerated resolution of acute VOC.

        "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., primarily Blacks/African-Americans. A multitude of complications negatively impacts quality of life. Hydroxyurea has been FDA approved since 1998 as a disease-modifying therapy for SCD, but is underutilized. Negative and uninformed perceptions of hydroxyurea and barriers to its use hinder adherence and promotion of the medication. As the largest real-world study to date that assessed hydroxyurea use for children and adults with SCD, we gathered and analyzed perspectives of providers, individuals with SCD, and families. Participants provided information about socio-demographics, hospital and emergency admissions for pain, number of severe pain episodes interfering with daily activities, medication adherence, and barriers to hydroxyurea. Providers reported on indications for hydroxyurea, reasons not prescribed, and current laboratory values. We found that hydroxyurea use was reported in over half of eligible patients from this large geographic region in the U.S., representing a range of sickle cell specialty clinical settings and practices. Provider and patient/caregiver reports about hydroxyurea use were consistent with one another; adults 26 years and older were least likely to be on hydroxyurea; and the likelihood of being on hydroxyurea decreased with one or more barriers. Using the intentional and unintentional medication nonadherence framework, we found that, even for patients on hydroxyurea, challenges to taking the medicine at the right time and forgetting were crucial unintentional barriers to adherence. Intentional barriers such as worry about side effects and \"tried and it did not work\" were important barriers for young adults and adults. For providers, diagnoses other than HgbSS or HgbS-β0 thalassemia were associated with lower odds of prescribing, consistent with evidence-based guidelines. Our results support strengthening provider understanding and confidence in implementing existing SCD guidelines, and the importance of shared decision making. Our findings can assist providers in understanding choices and decisions of families; guide individualized clinical discussions regarding hydroxyurea therapy; and help with developing tailored interventions to address barriers. Addressing barriers to hydroxyurea use can inform strategies to minimize similar barriers in the use of emerging and combination therapies for SCD.",

        "abstract": "Adverse pregnancy outcomes occur frequently in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) across the globe. In the United States, Black women experience disproportionately worse maternal health outcomes than all other racial groups. To better understand how social determinants of health impact SCD maternal morbidity, we used California's Department of Health Care Access and Information data (1991-2019) to estimate the cumulative incidence of pregnancy outcomes in Black women with and without SCD-adjusted for age, insurance status, and Distressed Community Index (DCI) scores. Black pregnant women with SCD were more likely to deliver at a younger age, use government insurance, and live in at-risk or distressed neighborhoods, compared to those without SCD. They also experienced higher stillbirths (26.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.5-36.1 vs. 12.4 [CI: 12.1-12.7], per 1000 births) and inpatient maternal mortality (344.5 [CI: 337.6-682.2] vs. 6.1 [CI: 2.3-8.4], per 100 000 live births). Multivariate logistic regression models showed Black pregnant women with SCD had significantly higher odds ratios (OR) for sepsis (OR 14.89, CI: 10.81, 20.52), venous thromboembolism (OR 13.60, CI: 9.16, 20.20), and postpartum hemorrhage (OR 2.25, CI 1.79-2.82), with peak onset in the second trimester, third trimester, and six weeks postpartum, respectively. Despite adjusting for sociodemographic factors, Black women with SCD still experienced significantly worse pregnancy outcomes than those without SCD. We need additional studies to determine if early introduction to reproductive health education, continuation of SCD-modifying therapies during pregnancy, and increasing access to multidisciplinary perinatal care can reduce morbidity in pregnant women with SCD.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report the incidence and risk factors for secondary neoplasm after transplantation for sickle cell disease. METHODS: Included are 1,096 transplants for sickle cell disease between 1991 and 2016. There were 22 secondary neoplasms. Types included leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 15) and solid tumor (n = 7). Fine-Gray regression models examined for risk factors for leukemia/MDS and any secondary neoplasm. RESULTS: The 10-year incidence of leukemia/MDS was 1.7% (95% CI, 0.90 to 2.9) and of any secondary neoplasm was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8). After adjusting for other risk factors, risks for leukemia/MDS (hazard ratio, 22.69; 95% CI, 4.34 to 118.66; P = .0002) or any secondary neoplasm (hazard ratio, 7.78; 95% CI, 2.20 to 27.53; P = .0015) were higher with low-intensity (nonmyeloablative) regimens compared with more intense regimens. All low-intensity regimens included total-body irradiation (TBI 300 or 400 cGy with alemtuzumab, TBI 300 or 400 cGy with cyclophosphamide, TBI 200, 300, or 400 cGy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, or TBI 200 cGy with fludarabine). None of the patients receiving myeloablative and only 23% of those receiving reduced-intensity regimens received TBI. CONCLUSION: Low-intensity regimens rely on tolerance induction and establishment of mixed-donor chimerism. Persistence of host cells exposed to low-dose radiation triggering myeloid malignancy is one plausible etiology. Pre-existing myeloid mutations and prior inflammation may also contribute but could not be studied using our data source. Choosing conditioning regimens likely to result in full-donor chimerism may in part mitigate the higher risk for leukemia/MDS.",

We present two different architectures for decoding systematic DI codes: (a) enumeration-based decoder, and (b) comparison-based decoder. We argue that enumeration-based decoders are often impractical for many realistic codes. Comparison-based decoders that detect arrival of a code word by comparing the received checkbits with checkbits evaluated using the received data are practical but suffer from the following limitation. If the decoder is to be implemented using asynchronous logic, i.e., if the gate and wire delays are arbitrary (unbounded but finite), then it is impossible to design a comparison-based decoder for any code that is more efficient than a dual-rail code.

It takes behavioral descriptions in a process+functional language called hopCP and produces a netlist for the Actel FPGA, supported by the VIEWlogic tools. hopCP descriptions are initially translated into an intermediate-form based on hypergraphs called HFG. SHILPA then applies action refinement, which is a technique for transforming HFGs into asynchronous hardware by a series of graph-based transformation rules. Action refinement is characterized by incremental resource allocation and control decomposition. The major contributions of the proposed work are: (i) the source language hopCP which is equipped with shared variables, broadcast channels, and barrier synchronization, that are constructs well suited for system-level hardware specification; (ii) use of flow analysis techniques to optimize resource allocation, to implement guarded commands efficiently, and ensure that shared variables are used `safely' (potentially concurrent reads and writes are detected); (iii) a self-timed macromodule library for Actel FPGA implementation.",

The flavan-3-ols (catechin and procyanidin B1) suggested a rapidly induced photoprotection mechanism aided by diverting proline as an alternative substrate for respiration to compensate for the progressive chlorosis that degrades photosystems. Meanwhile, glutathione, glutamate, and ascorbate levels significantly dropped in needles, which may indicate the critical oxidative stress that trees had to face since the onset of the infestation. They were not fully replenished after long-term infestation, and redox homeostasis was probably not achieved, compromising tree survival. Nevertheless, a huge auxins overexpression detected in needles throughout the infestation may reflect tolerance against the premature senescence caused by the woodwasp venom. In contrast, the metabolome of wood tissues remained initially unchanged, although it seems to collapse after three months. Overall, the metabolomics strategy adopted in this work evidenced its usefulness in uncovering the fundamental roles of plants' chemical defense that govern interactions with specific stressors.",

        "abstract": "Like angiosperms from several other families, the leguminous shrub Gastrolobium bilobum R.Br. produces and accumulates fluoroacetate, indicating that it performs the difficult chemistry needed to make a C-F bond. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that plants lack homologs of the only enzymes known to make a C-F bond, i.e., the Actinomycete flurorinases that form 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine from S-adenosylmethionine and fluoride ion. To probe the origin of fluoroacetate in G. bilobum we first showed that fluoroacetate accumulates to millimolar levels in young leaves but not older leaves, stems or roots, that leaf fluoroacetate levels vary >20-fold between individual plants and are not markedly raised by sodium fluoride treatment. Young leaves were fed adenosine-13C-ribose, 13C-serine, or 13C-acetate to test plausible biosynthetic routes to fluoroacetate from S-adenosylmethionine, a C3-pyridoxal phosphate complex, or acetyl-CoA, respectively. Incorporation of 13C into expected metabolites confirmed that all three precursors were taken up and metabolized. Consistent with the bioinformatic evidence against an Actinomycete-type pathway, no adenosine-13C-ribose was converted to 13C-fluoroacetate; nor was the characteristic 4-fluorothreonine product of the Actinomycete pathway detected. Similarly, no 13C from acetate or serine was incorporated into fluoroacetate. While not fully excluding the hypothetical pathways that were tested, these negative labeling data imply that G. bilobum creates the C-F bond by an unprecedented biochemical reaction. Enzyme(s) that mediate such a reaction could be of great value in pharmaceutical and agrochemical manufacturing.",

        "issued": "2022",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome may play a role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases including major depressive disorder (MDD). Bile acids (BAs) are steroid acids that are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and further processed by gut-bacterial enzymes, thus requiring both human and gut microbiome enzymatic processes in their metabolism. BAs participate in a range of important host functions such as lipid transport and metabolism, cellular signaling and regulation of energy homeostasis. BAs have recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's and several other neuropsychiatric diseases, but the biochemical underpinnings of these gut microbiome-linked metabolites in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety remains largely unknown. METHOD: Using targeted metabolomics, we profiled primary and secondary BAs in the baseline serum samples of 208 untreated outpatients with MDD. We assessed the relationship of BA concentrations and the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms as defined by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD17) and the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HRSA-Total), respectively. We also evaluated whether the baseline metabolic profile of BA informs about treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The concentration of the primary BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was significantly lower at baseline in both severely depressed (log2 fold difference (LFD) = -0.48; p = 0.021) and highly anxious (LFD = -0.43; p = 0.021) participants compared to participants with less severe symptoms. The gut bacteria-derived secondary BAs produced from CDCA such as lithocholic acid (LCA) and several of its metabolites, and their ratios to primary BAs, were significantly higher in the more anxious participants (LFD's range = [0.23, 1.36]; p's range = [6.85E-6, 1.86E-2]). The interaction analysis of HRSD17 and HRSA-Total suggested that the BA concentration differences were more strongly correlated to the symptoms of anxiety than depression. Significant differences in baseline CDCA (LFD = -0.87, p = 0.0009), isoLCA (LFD = -1.08, p = 0.016) and several BA ratios (LFD's range [0.46, 1.66], p's range [0.0003, 0.049]) differentiated treatment failures from remitters. CONCLUSION: In patients with MDD, BA profiles representing changes in gut microbiome compositions are associated with higher levels of anxiety and increased probability of first-line treatment failure. If confirmed, these findings suggest the possibility of developing gut microbiome-directed therapies for MDD characterized by gut dysbiosis.",

        "abstract": "Telomeres shorten with age and shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) has been associated with various age-related diseases. Thus, LTL has been considered a biomarker of biological aging. Dyslipidemia is an established risk factor for most age-related metabolic disorders. However, little is known about the relationship between LTL and dyslipidemia. Lipidomics is a new biochemical technique that can simultaneously identify and quantify hundreds to thousands of small molecular lipid species. In a large population comprising 1843 well-characterized American Indians in the Strong Heart Family Study, we examined the lipidomic profile of biological aging assessed by LTL. Briefly, LTL was quantified by qPCR. Fasting plasma lipids were quantified by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Lipids associated with LTL were identified by elastic net modeling. Of 1542 molecular lipids identified (518 known, 1024 unknown), 174 lipids (36 knowns) were significantly associated with LTL, independent of chronological age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes status, smoking status, bulk HDL-C, and LDL-C. These findings suggest that altered lipid metabolism is associated with biological aging and provide novel insights that may enhance our understanding of the relationship between dyslipidemia, biological aging, and age-related diseases in American Indians.",

        "abstract": "With the goal of identifying metabolites that significantly correlate with the protective e2 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, we established a consortium of five studies of healthy aging and extreme human longevity with 3545 participants. This consortium includes the New England Centenarian Study, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the Arivale study, the Longevity Genes Project/LonGenity studies, and the Long Life Family Study. We analyzed the association between APOE genotype groups E2 (e2e2 and e2e3 genotypes, N = 544), E3 (e3e3 genotypes, N = 2299), and E4 (e3e4 and e4e4 genotypes, N = 702) with metabolite profiles in the five studies and used fixed effect meta-analysis to aggregate the results. Our meta-analysis identified a signature of 19 metabolites that are significantly associated with the E2 genotype group at FDR < 10%. The group includes 10 glycerolipids and 4 glycerophospholipids that were all higher in E2 carriers compared to E3, with fold change ranging from 1.08 to 1.25. The organic acid 6-hydroxyindole sulfate, previously linked to changes in gut microbiome that were reflective of healthy aging and longevity, was also higher in E2 carriers compared to E3 carriers. Three sterol lipids and one sphingolipid species were significantly lower in carriers of the E2 genotype group. For some of these metabolites, the effect of the E2 genotype opposed the age effect. No metabolites reached a statistically significant association with the E4 group. This work confirms and expands previous results connecting the APOE gene to lipid regulation and suggests new links between the e2 allele, lipid metabolism, aging, and the gut-brain axis.",

        "abstract": "The straightforward reaction of two equivalents of the lithium salt of the bulky terphenyl ligand Li(OEt2)C6H3-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-iPr3)2 with suspensions of GeCl2·dioxane, SnCl2, or PbBr2 in diethyl ether resulted in the isolation of the very crowded σ-bonded diaryl tetrylenes of formula E{C6H3-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-iPr3)2}2 (E = Ge (1), Sn (2), Pb (3)) as blue crystalline solids. Despite their high level of steric congestion, X-ray crystallography showed that compounds 1-3 possess Cipso-E-Cipso interligand bond angles in the range 107.61-112.55°, which are narrower than those observed in analogous species with less bulky terphenyl substituents. Compounds 1-3 were characterized by 1H, 13C{1H} (1-3), and 119Sn{1H} (2) NMR spectroscopy, whereas solution 207Pb{1H} NMR spectroscopy of 3 has not yet afforded a signal under ambient conditions. FT-IR and UV-vis spectra of 1-3 were also recorded. The relatively narrow interligand angles displayed by 1-3 are attributed in part to the increase in London dispersion force interactions between the two AriPr6 (AriPr6 = -C6H3-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-iPr3)2) groups from carbon atoms in some of the isopropyl substituents and several carbon atoms from the flanking aryl rings.

Reaction of {AriPr6Sn(μ-H)}2 and {AriPr4Sn(μ-H)}2 with 2 equiv of diphenyl acetylene, PhCCPh, afforded the aryl alkenyl stannylenes AriPr6SnC(Ph)C(H)Ph (1) and AriPr4SnC(Ph)C(H)Ph (2). In contrast, the analogous reactions of {AriPr6Sn(μ-H)}2 with 2 equiv of phenyl acetylene, HCCPh, afforded a high yield of the cis-1,2 addition product AriPr6(H)SnC(H)C(Ph)Sn(H)AriPr6 (3), which has a four-membered Sn2C2 core structure comprised of two Sn-Sn bonded Sn(H)AriPr6 units bridged by a -C(H)=C(Ph)- moiety. The corresponding reaction of the less bulky hydride {AriPr4Sn(μ-H)}2 with 2 equiv of phenyl acetylene leads to AriPr4SnC(H)C(Ph)Sn(H)2AriPr4 (4) which unlike 3 has no Sn-Sn bonding. Instead, the tin atoms are connected solely by a -C(H) =C(Ph)- moiety. Each tin atom carries a AriPr4 substituent but one is also substituted by two hydrogens. The difference in behavior between PhCCPh and HCCPh is attributed mainly to the difference in steric bulk of the two substrates. The different products 3 and 4 are probably a consequence of the difference in size and dispersion force interactions of the AriPr6 and AriPr4 substituents.

The crystal structures of both ligands have been determined by X-ray diffraction technique and the results revealed that fluoro-substitution has an important impact on the molecular conformations and crystal packing patterns. The solution reactions of two ligands (L and LF) with silver(I) hexafluorophosphate afforded their Ag(I) complexes 1 and 2, respectively, with good-quality crystals which have been structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. While 1 including ligand L displays a 3-dimensional (3-D) coordination network, where silver(I) adopts pseudo-tetradedral coordination geometry, 2 shows a 1-D polymeric chain with di-coordinate silver(I) ions being bridging metal nodes. The remarkable difference observed in silver(I) coordination chemistry further highlights the role of fluoro-substitution in governing the metal-driven self-assembly process involving thioether compounds. The thermal properties of both ligands and silver(I) complexes have been investigated.",

X-ray structural analysis reveals that even though the same metal ion (Ag+) and ligand (L) were used to react under the same conditions, anions have played a critical role in driving the variation of metal–ligand binding modes as well as network topologies of the resultant coordination polymers. The reaction of L with silver nitrate resulted in a 2-D coordination network 1, composed of metallomacrocycles bridged with NO3−ions. A 3-D framework 2 was observed when silver tetrafluoroborate was used. Although BF4−ions were not involved in coordinating with metal centers, the participation of water molecules led to a different metal–ligand binding mode and hence the formation of a network with higher dimension. The large, non-coordinating anion PF6−was found to be responsible for the assembly of a 2-D grid-like network 3, in which interesting 4+4 metallocycles occupied with PF6−ions were disclosed. However, the presence of a larger anion analog, SbF6−simplified the network structure to form a 1-D helical chain (4) through the coordination of solvent molecules (CH3CN) with silver(I) centers.",

The phantom incorporates disk-pairs oriented parallel to the axial plane (perpendicular to the z-axis) at various locations throughout the field of view. Experiments were conducted in which the phantom was imaged using a mobile C-arm with various, tilted and untilted source-detector trajectories (orbits). In the current work, scan orbits were limited to circular orbits - viz., a semicircular arc spanning 196°. The magnitude of cone-beam artifacts was assessed in terms of the signal modulation (zmod) in the narrow region between disk-pairs, and the relationship of zmod and tan was evaluated for each orbit. The results show visually and quantitatively the effect of scan orbit and object orientation on cone-beam sampling effects and demonstrate the relationship between analytical tan and empirical zmod figures of merit. The analysis suggests a means by which cone-beam sampling effects (incompleteness) can be quantifiably considered in the development of new cone-beam CT system geometries, multi-source configurations, and protocols involving novel source-detector trajectories.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether systematic bias in attenuation measurements occurs among CT scanners made by four major manufacturers and the relevance of this bias regarding opportunistic screening for osteoporosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on attenuation measurement accuracy were acquired using the American College of Radiology (ACR) accreditation phantom and were evaluated in a blinded fashion for four CT manufacturers (8500 accreditation submissions for manufacturer A; 18,575 for manufacturer B; 8278 for manufacturer C; and 32,039 for manufacturer D). The attenuation value for water, acrylic (surrogate for trabecular bone), and Teflon (surrogate for cortical bone; Chemours) materials for an adult abdominal CT technique (120 kV, 240 mA, standard reconstruction algorithm) was used in the analysis. Differences in attenuation value across all manufacturers were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. RESULTS. The mean attenuation value for water ranged from -0.3 to 2.7 HU, with highly significant differences among all manufacturers (p < 0.001). For the trabecular bone surrogate, differences in attenuation values across all manufacturers were also highly significant (p < 0.001), with mean values of 120.9 (SD, 3.5), 124.6 (3.3), 126.9 (4.4), and 123.9 (3.4) HU for manufacturers A, B, C, and D, respectively. For the cortical bone surrogate, differences in attenuation values across all manufacturers were also highly significant (p < 0.001), with mean values of 939.0 (14.2), 874.3 (13.3), 897.6 (11.3), and 912.7 (13.4) HU for manufacturers A, B, C, and D, respectively. CONCLUSION. CT scanners made by different manufacturers show systematic offsets in attenuation measurement when compared with each other. Knowledge of these off-sets is useful for optimizing the accuracy of opportunistic diagnosis of osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "The first day of the Molecular Imaging Symposium (MI‐1) will focus on the technology aspects of molecular, functional, and small animal imaging. Modalities which will be discussed include micro‐CT, micro‐PET, and high resolution MRI for small animal imaging. The presentation on micro‐CT technology will include an introduction to the basic requirements of the scanner hardware, examples of the images and biological applications in which micro‐CT is useful, and the radiation dose to the small animal undergoing micro‐CT will also be discussed. Micro‐CT techniques require longer acquisition times than human scanners, and thus maintaining the animal in a viable but motionless state is of clear importance. Therefore, issues surrounding animal support including anesthesia and respiratory gating will also be presented. Micro‐PET systems are widely used in small animal imaging for genome research, and represent probably the mainstay of truly molecular imaging modalities at this point in time. The presentation on micro‐PET will include a description of micro‐PET scanner hardware, a discussion of PET‐radiotracers, and an overview of current small animal PET systems. The limitation of current micro‐PET system design will be discussed, and ideas for overcoming some of these limitations will be presented. High resolution MRI systems have the benefit of delivering exquisite contrast with excellent spatial resolution, with no ionizing radiation. The presentation on micro‐MRI techniques for phenotype imaging will describe the integration of physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and computer science which is necessary to achieve state‐of‐the‐art small animal MRI imaging. The use of hyperpolarized gases for lung imaging and MR histology will be discussed as well. The availability of small animal imaging systems across a number of modalities has proved essential for a large number of research applications. The primary goal of MI‐1 is to help familiarize medical physicists with the technical design and capabilities of these high resolution small animal imaging systems, and to highlight research applications of their use. Different modalities are used to address different research questions, and this symposium will emphasize the strengths and weaknesses of each modality in regards to various research applications. Differences between animal imaging and human scanners will also be discussed. © 2006, American Association of Physicists in Medicine. All rights reserved.",

        "issued": "2013-06",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Significant anomalies in scanner reported values of CTDIvol for stationary table protocols (with aberrant, elevated values of CTDIvol up to 300 % higher than the actual dose to the phantom), have been observed; well beyond the typical accuracy expected of CTDIvol as a phantom dose. Recognition of these outliers as bad data is important to users of CT dose index tracking systems (e.g. ACR DIR), and a method for recognition and correction is provided. A second anomaly is that the reported CTDIvol for automatic tube current modulation (TCM) has a different physical meaning from the traditional CTDIvol at constant mA, resulting in the dichotomy CTDIvol of the first and second kinds. Methods: Rigorous equations are derived to describe the accumulated dose distributions for auto TCM and for stationary table CT. A comparison with formulae for scanner reported values of CTDIvol clearly identifies the source of these anomalies. Results: For the stationary table, use of the CTDI100 formula (applicable to a moving phantom only) generates extra scatter and an over beaming correction, both of which are non existent if the phantom is held stationary. It is shown that CTDIvol is not robust between fixed mA and auto TCM in this case only DLP is robust. Conclusion: For the case of a stationary phantom, correction of CTDI100 prior to its use in the calculation of CTDIvol using the approach to equilibrium formula H(a) serves as a method of recognition of bad data and as a correction factor for same. In the case of auto TCM, the use of CTDIvol is compromised, and an alternative (approximate) physical interpretation is suggested. However, the reported DLP value (integral dose) remains robust between the fixed and auto mA modes. © 2013, American Association of Physicists in Medicine. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Embedding medical scrubs with robust biocidal functions could potentially reduce pathogen cross-contamination and healthcare-associated infections. Here, a halamine precursor monomer, 1-acryloyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylimidazolidin-4-one (ACTMIO), was covalently grafted to a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric, which is a common textile material used in medical scrubs, via a controlled free radical graft polymerization reaction using a \"pad-dry-cure\"finishing process. Based on a computational model and Hansen solubility theory, an ideal free radical reaction system was designed and implemented. The obtained ACTMIO-grafted (H-PET-g-ACTMIO) fabrics exhibited high grafting ratios of the monomers, desired properties of improved hydrophilicity, large active chlorine capacity, promising chlorine rechargeability, and desirable washing durability due to the robust covalent bonds between halamine moieties and PET fabrics. The chlorinated H-PET-g-ACTMIO fabric demonstrated powerful and regenerable biocidal performance against pathogenic bacteria, revealing the great application potential as a bioprotective medical textile. In addition, the successful application of Hansen solubility theory in surface modification of chemically inert polyester fibers provides a good example of controlling free radical polymerization reactions on textile materials.",

        "abstract": "Dendrobium officinale has remarkable medicinal functions and high economic value. Laser light sources are different from ordinary light sources in terms of the light emission mechanism and play important roles regulating functional metabolite synthesis in D. officinale. However, the mechanism by which miRNAs participate in regulating the D. officinale response to blue laser irradiation has not been reported. Previous studies found that the number of red leaves on plants treated with blue laser light was greater than that on plants treated with blue light and white light, and blue laser light was most effective at promoting the accumulation of total flavonoids, polysaccharides and alkaloids. RNA-seq was used to analyse the difference in the effects of lasers on D. officinale. KEGG analysis of the target genes of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs showed that there were multiple blue laser response pathways, among which peroxisome, nitrogen metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism played central roles. Cytoscape interaction analysis of DE miRNA targets showed that novel_miR_248 most likely participates in the influence of blue laser irradiation on D. officinale. Content verification in D. officinale showed that blue laser light could also increase the total terpene, chlorophyll levels, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase. Combined with the qPCR results, these findings showed that miR395b, miR827 and miR319l may participate in the blue laser signalling network through their target genes and then regulate the accumulation of functional metabolites in D. officinale. This study provides a scientific basis for the high-yield production of D. officinale.",

        "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are widely used to provide a hydrophobic and oleophobic barrier in some fabric finishing. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a class of harmful chemicals that persist in the environment and our bodies. For indoor upholstery, these finishes are used to prevent staining. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance finishes on commercial indoor fabrics for liquid repellency and stain performance. Three fabrics, each with an unfinished control, a dip finish, and a foam finish, were tested with coffee and oil-based salad dressing stains, two dwell times, two stain application procedures, and three abrasion conditions. Oil stain severity was affected by fabric type, finish, dwell time, and application procedure, but not abrasion. For water-based coffee stains, only fabric type had an effect. Droplet contact angle tests were also performed, revealing water and oil repellency is quickly lost with abrasion. Of the six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance-finished fabrics tested, five showed small improvements in stain performance over unfinished fabrics; however, the performance differences between fabric types were much larger than the benefits from finishes. For oil stains, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance finishes help in ideal conditions when the finish is unabraded, stains are set gently on the fabric, and stains are cleaned quickly. Our results suggest that the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on indoor furniture can be considerably reduced through intentional material selection to achieve better stain performance in lieu of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance finishes.",

        "abstract": "Ixodes (Ixodes) mojavensis, n. sp. (Acari: Ixodidae), is described from all parasitic stages collected from the endangered vole Microtus californicus scirpensis Bailey, 1900 (Rodentia: Cricetidae), Mus musculus L. 1758 (Rodentia: Muridae), and Reithrodontomys megalotis (Baird; 1857) (Rodentia: Cricetidae) in the Amargosa Valley of California. When first collected in 2014, this tick was tentatively identified as Ixodes minor Neumann, 1902 because the nucleotide similarity between its 16S rDNA sequence and a homologous GenBank sequence from an I. minor from the eastern U.S. was 99.51%. Nevertheless, adults of I. mojavensis differ morphologically from I. minor by hypostomal dentition, absence of a spur on palpal segment I, and punctation patterns; nymphs by the shapes of basis capituli, auriculae, cervical grooves and external files of hypostomal denticles; and larvae by the length of idiosomal setae and hypostomal dentition. DNA sequencing of fragments of 4 different genes, 12S rDNA, 16S rDNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and intergenic transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of I. mojavensis and of closely related species of Ixodes shows that the mitochondrial gene sequences of the new tick species are almost identical to the I. minor homologous genes. Phylogenetically, the two species do not cluster in mutually exclusive monophyletic clades. However, ITS2 sequences of I. mojavensis and I. minor diverge deeply (≥ 5.74% maximum likelihood divergence) and are as different as homologous genes from other recognized species. The discrepancy between the two sets of genes is suggestive of past mitochondrial introgression or incomplete mitochondrial lineage sorting.",

        "abstract": "The tropical lineage within the Rhipicephalus sanguineus species complex is cause for growing concern in the U.S. based on its prominent role in creating and perpetuating multiple recently identified outbreaks of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This lineage is undergoing a northward range expansion in the United States, necessitating the need for enhanced surveillance for Rh. sanguineus. To inform more focused surveillance efforts we use species distribution models (SDMs) to predict current (2015-2019) and future (2021-2040) habitat for the tropical lineage. Models using the MaxEnt algorithm were informed using geolocations of ticks genetically confirmed to be of the tropical lineage, for which data on 23 climatic and ecological variables were extracted. Models predicted that suitability was optimal where temperatures are relatively warm and stable, and there is minimal precipitation. This translated into habitat being predicted along much of the coast of southern states including California, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Although the endophilic nature of tropical Rh. sanguineus somewhat violates the assumptions of SDMs, our models correctly predicted known locations of this tick and provide a starting point for increased surveillance efforts. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of using molecular methods to distinguish between ticks in the Rh. sanguineus species complex.",

        "abstract": "Babesia species are intraerythrocytic piroplasms that can result in disease characterized by hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Of the 5 species that are known to infect canids in the United States, Babesia conradae is most frequently diagnosed in California, and Babesia vogeli is prevalent in the US. Despite the recent re-emergence of B. conradae, the mechanism of transmission is not known. Coyotes (Canis latrans) have been a proposed reservoir of disease, and previous work has shown that dogs with known aggressive interactions with coyotes are at greater risk for infection. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of B. conradae in wild coyote populations in California to assess the viability of coyotes as a potential source of infection for domestic dogs. Four hundred and sixty-one splenic samples were obtained during post-mortem examination of coyote carcasses from Southern California, Fresno, and Hopland. Demographic data including age, sex, cause of death, and urbanity were collected for each coyote. DNA was extracted from samples and amplified using real-time PCR with primers specific for the B. conradae ITS-2 gene. The 18S gene was amplified and sequenced using conventional PCR primers specific to the Babesia genus from any coyotes positive for B. conradae. In total, 22 coyotes tested positive for B. conradae in Fresno (n = 15), Orange (n = 4), San Bernardino (n = 1), and Los Angeles counties (n = 1) with an overall prevalence of 4.8%. Coyotes from Fresno (P<.01) and rural coyotes (P<.01) were significantly more likely to be infected with B. conradae. Ten of 14 samples sequenced were 99-100% homologous to B. conradae, and 4 samples were 100% homologous with B. vogeli DNA indicating co-infection with both pathogens. This study demonstrates that coyotes can become infected and harbor B. conradae and B. vogeli and should be investigated as a possible source of infection in domestic dogs.",

        "abstract": "Greater understanding of intraguild dynamics in rodent communities and of how house mice, Mus musculus, interact with wild sympatric rodents is needed. House mice can be a particularly virulent invasive species, presenting a potential threat to native biodiversity. In the Mojave Desert, western harvest mice, Reithrodontomys megalotis and the endangered Amargosa vole, Microtus californicus scirpensis, inhabit a fragmented desert wetland ecosystem. The Amargosa vole relies heavily on bulrush, Schoenoplectus americanus, for food, as well as thermal and predator refuge. We used two species occupancy models and estimated activity pattern overlap to explore spatial and temporal interactions within this rodent guild. For each species pairing, we compared the relative performance of a series of candidate occupancy models, with the most supported model structures and components distinguished by AICc and AICc weight. We found that voles reduced the detectability of western harvest mice and house mice, but did not spatially exclude them. Our findings also suggested that voles were more detectable in bulrush stands as bulrush cover increased, whereas house mice and western harvest mice were negatively associated with bulrush cover. House mice and western harvest mice had high activity pattern overlap, (Δ̂4 0.89, 95% CI = 0.85-0.96), which was greater with each other than with voles (Δ̂4 0.69, 95% CI = 0.57-0.75 and Δ̂4 0.66, 95% CI = 0.49-0.70, respectively). House mice were also more detectable in the presence of western harvest mice, suggesting niche overlap or an attraction to them. Our observations suggest that, during the summer months, Amargosa voles could be a limiting factor on the behaviour and/or population densities of smaller rodent species in bulrush habitat. Drought exacerbated habitat changes may have contributed to house mouse expansion and vole decline in the region. While a deeper understanding of trophic dynamics is required, continued efforts to preserve the endangered Amargosa vole and it's habitat may also help mitigate any potential harm caused by free-living house mice in these desert wetlands.",

        "abstract": "Sarcoptic mange poses a serious conservation threat to endangered San Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis mutica). After first appearing in Bakersfield, California in spring 2013, mange reduced the kit fox population approximately 50% until the epidemic ended with minimally detectable endemic cases after 2020. Mange is lethal and thus, with such a high force of infection and lack of immunity, it remains unclear why the epidemic did not burn itself out rapidly and how it persisted so long. Here we explored spatio-temporal patterns of the epidemic, analyzed historical movement data, and created a compartment metapopulation model (named \"metaseir\") to evaluate whether movement of foxes among patches and spatial heterogeneity would reproduce the eight years epidemic with 50% population reduction observed in Bakersfield. Our main findings from metaseir were that: 1) a simple metapopulation model can capture the Bakersfield-like disease epidemic dynamics even when there is no environmental reservoir or external spillover host, 2) the most impactful parameter on persistence and magnitude of the epidemic is the projection, β/αβ (transmission over decay rate of transmission over space), 3) heterogeneity in patch carrying capacities changes the critical value of the projection needed to achieve an epidemic but makes little difference to epidemic persistence time, and 4) the epidemic is relatively insensitive to birth rates and density vs. frequency-dependent transmission. Our model can help guide management and assessment of metapopulation viability of this vulpid subspecies, while the exploratory data analysis and model will also be valuable to understand mange in other, particularly den-occupying, species.",

        "abstract": "FeCoHf films with different Hf contents and thicknesses were deposited by composition-gradient sputtering. The results showed that the stripe domain (SD) structure emerges when the film thickness exceeds a critical thickness (220-330 nm), but the increase in introduced Hf leads to a decrease in magnetization, and in turn, the stripe phase weakens and eventually disappears. Dynamic measurements revealed magnetic domain-dependent resonant absorption spectra with up to seven resonance peaks, which have rarely been observed in magnetic film with an established SD structure. The number of resonant peaks can be controlled by the saturation magnetization of the film. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that multiple magnetic domain resonance modes can be attributed to the enhanced magnetization, which induces an increase in the magnetic domain wall volume. These results emphasize the pivotal role of magnetic domain dynamics in the framework of spintronic and microwave devices.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of topological states of matter has led to a revolution in materials research. When external or intrinsic parameters break symmetries, global properties of topological materials change drastically. A paramount example is the emergence of Weyl nodes under broken inversion symmetry. While a rich variety of non-trivial quantum phases could in principle also originate from broken time-reversal symmetry, realizing systems that combine magnetism with complex topological properties is remarkably elusive. Here, we demonstrate that giant open Fermi arcs are created at the surface of ultrathin hybrid magnets where the Fermi-surface topology is substantially modified by hybridization with a heavy-metal substrate. The interplay between magnetism and topology allows us to control the shape and the location of the Fermi arcs by tuning the magnetization direction. The hybridization points in the Fermi surface can be attributed to a non-trivial mixed topology and induce hot-spots in the Berry curvature, dominating spin and charge transport as well as magneto-electric coupling effects.",

The electronic-structural characterization of such phenomena presents a unique challenge due to the lack of direct yet nondestructive techniques for probing buried layers and interfaces with the required Ångstrom-level resolution, as well as element and orbital specificity. In this Review, we survey several recent studies wherein soft x-ray standing-wave photoelectron spectroscopy - a relatively newly developed technique - is used to investigate buried oxide interfaces exhibiting emergent phenomena such as metal-insulator transition, interfacial ferromagnetism, and two-dimensional electron gas. The advantages, challenges, and future applications of this methodology are also discussed.",

Topological quantum materials, where spin-momentum locking is believed to lead to particularly long spin lifetimes, are regarded as a promising platform for such applications. However, spin-orbit coupling, that is essential to all topological matter, at the same time gives rise to spin mixing and decoherence as a major obstacle for quantum computing. Here, we give experimental evidence that hot-spots of spin-mixing and spin-conserving contributions of the spin-orbit operator coexist in an archetypal topological Dirac metal, and that these hot spots can have a strongly anisotropic distribution of their respective wave vectors with respect to the spin quantization direction. Our results can be understood within a theory that takes into account the decomposition of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian into spin-conserving and spin-flip terms, contributing to a better understanding of quantum decoherence in topological materials, in general.",

Clostridioides difficile can cause enterotyphlocolitis with colic in horses of all ages, and the process is commonly referred to as C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD). Here we report the results of the postmortem examination of a 7-y-old Thoroughbred racehorse with concurrent CDAD, EFE, and gastric rupture that was euthanized following a history of colic over several days. A segment of distal jejunum and proximal ileum had passed through the epiploic foramen, and the intestinal wall was thickened and dark-red. The remaining small intestinal loops were distended and filled with blood-tinged contents. Peritonitis had resulted from escape of gastric contents into the abdominal cavity through a tear in the major curvature of the stomach. Histologically, the incarcerated segment had acute transmural hemorrhage with congestion and mucosal necrosis; neutrophilic infiltrates with fibrin thrombi were in the mucosa of the non-incarcerated small intestinal segments. C. difficile toxins were detected in the small intestinal contents, and C. difficile was isolated from the small intestine, colon, and cecum.",

The aim of the study was to characterize and compare anamnestic data together with pulmonary gross, histologic, and ultrastructural findings in racehorses with EIPH (n = 10), EAFPH (n = 10), and control horses (n = 5). No differences in anamnesis were identified between the 3 groups. Grossly cranial lobe reddening and edema scores were significantly more prevalent and severe in the EAFPH group compared with the EIPH and control groups. Histologically, hemorrhage scores were higher in the EAFPH group, while hemosiderophages, iron encrustations of collagen and elastin fibers, and vascular remodeling scores were significantly higher in EIPH group compared with the EAFPH and control groups. In all groups, caudal lung locations exhibited a significantly higher score for vascular remodeling, hemosiderophage accumulation, iron encrustation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia when compared with cranial, dorsal, and ventral locations. Ultrastructural analysis of perivascular collagen showed fibrils with significantly larger diameters in the EAFPH group compared with the EIPH group but not compared with the control group. This study demonstrates that lungs of horses that experienced EAFPH show significantly less vascular remodeling and other long-term pulmonary abnormalities that characterize horses with EIPH.",

        "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens type D epsilon toxin (ETX) produces severe, and frequently fatal, neurologic disease in ruminant livestock. The disorder is of worldwide distribution and, although vaccination has reduced its prevalence, ETX still causes substantial economic loss in livestock enterprises. The toxin is produced in the intestine as a relatively inactive prototoxin, which is subsequently fully enzymatically activated to ETX. When changed conditions in the intestinal milieu, particularly starch overload, favor rapid proliferation of this clostridial bacterium, large amounts of ETX can be elaborated. When sufficient toxin is absorbed from the intestine into the systemic circulation and reaches the brain, two neurologic syndromes can develop from this enterotoxemia. If the brain is exposed to large amounts of ETX, the lesions are fundamentally vasculocentric. The neurotoxin binds to microvascular endothelial receptors and other brain cells, the resulting damage causing increased vascular permeability and extravasation of plasma protein and abundant fluid into the brain parenchyma. While plasma protein, particularly albumin, pools largely perivascularly, the vasogenic edema becomes widely distributed in the brain, leading to a marked rise in intracranial pressure, coma, sometimes cerebellar herniation, and, eventually, often death. When smaller quantities of ETX are absorbed into the bloodstream, or livestock are partially immune, a more protracted clinical course ensues. The resulting brain injury is characterized by bilaterally symmetrical necrotic foci in certain selectively vulnerable neuroanatomic sites, termed focal symmetrical encephalomalacia. ETX has also been internationally listed as a potential bioterrorism agent. Although there are no confirmed human cases of ETX intoxication, the relatively wide species susceptibility to this toxin and its high toxicity mean it is likely that human populations would also be vulnerable to its neurotoxic actions. While the pathogenesis of ETX toxicity in the brain is incompletely understood, the putative mechanisms involved in neural lesion development are discussed.",

The aim of this study was to analyse clinicopathologic parameters and antibody titres up to the diagnosis of EPE. During the 2019 season, all foals born on a large breeding farm in Germany were enrolled in a monitoring program for EPE from four to nine months of age, including evaluation of rectal temperature, white blood cell count as well as serum total protein and albumin. 42 foals developed EPE between September 2019 and January 2020. Data sets of these foals and 83 age matched control foals were included in this study. All affected foals showed hypoproteinaemia and 39/42 showed hypoalbuminaemia at the onset of EPE. Total protein and albumin decreased rapidly within 7.5 days on average before the diagnosis of EPE. Both total protein and albumin values were significantly lower in the EPE-group compared to the matching foals (p < 0.0001). Seroconversion was observed in all 42 affected foals and in 50/83 matching foals. At the time of diagnosis, affected foals had a significantly higher titre compared to the matching foals (p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the titre increased significantly between the preceding sampling and the week of diagnosis in both groups (p < 0.0001). Faecal qPCR for Lawsonia intracellularis revealed positive results in 22/42 affected foals. Based on the data analysed here, a high IPMA-titre does neither indicate protection against EPE nor a definite diagnosis of EPE, as both healthy foals and those with clinical EPE show a positive antibody titre against Lawsonia intracellularis.",

Using nasal swabs from clinically healthy sport horses submitted for qPCR testing after an outbreak of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) myeloencephalopathy (EHM) in the spring of 2022, this study aimed to identify the rate of clinically healthy horses shedding common and less characterized respiratory pathogens within the sport horse population to better understand their role in outbreaks. Swabs were collected during a required quarantine and testing period, according to the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF), and showed return-to-competition requirements. Common respiratory pathogens, such as equine influenza virus (EIV), EHV-4, and equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), were found at low but stable frequencies within previously reported ranges, whereas EHV-1 and Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) were found at or above previously reported frequencies. Less characterized respiratory pathogens, such as EHV-2, EHV-5, and S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus), were found within previously reported ranges. Common respiratory pathogens, especially EHV-1 following the multiple EHM outbreaks, were found to be circulating in clinically healthy sport horse populations, reflecting their silent transmission. The strategy of quarantine and EHV-1 qPCR testing of clinically healthy horses was successful at eliminating additional EHM outbreaks and facilitating safe return to competition with no reported respiratory disease outbreaks following the subsequent shows in California.",

        "abstract": "Horses and other equids can be infected with several viruses of the family Flaviviridae, belonging to the genus Flavivirus and Hepacivirus. This consensus statement focuses on viruses with known occurrence in Europe, with the objective to summarize the current literature and formulate clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations regarding clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The viruses circulating in Europe include West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Usutu virus, Louping ill virus and the equine hepacivirus. West Nile virus and Usutu virus are mosquito-borne, while tick-borne encephalitis virus and Louping ill virus are tick-borne. The natural route of transmission for equine hepacivirus remains speculative. West Nile virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus can induce encephalitis in infected horses. In the British Isle, rare equine cases of encephalitis associated with Louping ill virus are reported. In contrast, equine hepacivirus infections are associated with mild acute hepatitis and possibly chronic hepatitis. Diagnosis of flavivirus infections is made primarily by serology, although cross-reactivity occurs. Virus neutralization testing is considered the gold standard to differentiate between flavivirus infections in horses. Hepacivirus infection is detected by serum or liver RT-PCR. No direct antiviral treatment against flavi- or hepacivirus infections in horses is currently available and thus, treatment is supportive. Three vaccines against West Nile virus are licensed in the European Union. Geographic expansion of flaviviruses pathogenic for equids should always be considered a realistic threat, and it would be beneficial if their detection was included in surveillance programs.",

Prophylactic treatment strategies with diclazuril have shown to reduce seroprevalence and titer levels to Sarcocystis neurona in healthy horses continuously exposed to the apicomplexan parasite. The goal of this study was to determine if the FDA-labeled dose of 1 mg/kg of 1.56% diclazuril (ProtazilTM) given once weekly to healthy adult horses would achieve steady-state concentrations in plasma known to be inhibitory to S. neurona in cell culture. Five individual diclazuril doses were administered at weekly intervals to 8 adult horses. Blood was collected via venipuncture immediately before (trough concentration) and 10 hours after (peak concentration) each diclazuril administration. Following the fifth dose, additional blood samples were collected every 24 hours after the peak blood collection for 7 days. All plasma samples were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a nonlinear mixed effects model. The mean population-derived peak concentration was 264 ng/mL and the mean terminal half-life was 3.6 days. Thus, the oral administration of an FDA-labeled dose of diclazuril to healthy horses once a week was able to produce steady-state plasma drug concentrations known to inhibit S. neurona in vitro.",

        "abstract": "EHV-1 vaccines are often administered intranasally during emergency situation such as outbreaks of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy. However, there is currently no data available on the efficacy of such protocols, nor the diagnostic challenge when recently vaccinated horses become clinically infected and nasal secretions are collected to support a diagnosis of EHV-1 infection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if two commercially available EHV-1 vaccines, a killed-adjuvanted (Calvenza) and a modified-live (Rhinomune) EHV-1 vaccine, could induce a measurable systemic antibody response postintranasal administration. A second objective was to determine the detection time of EHV-1 in nasal secretions by qPCR following the intranasal administration of the respective EHV-1 vaccines. Thirty healthy adult horses, with no recent EHV-1 vaccine administration, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Rhinomune group, Calvenza group, and unvaccinated control group. Total Ig and isotype-specific IgG4/7 against EHV-1 measured pre- and 30-days post-vaccination were not different amongst the three study groups. Vaccine-derived EHV-1 was only detected in the two EHV-1 vaccine groups with 9/10 horses in the Rhinomune group and 8/10 horses in the Calvenza group testing qPCR-positive for EHV-1 for 1 to 3 days. There was no significant difference in number of horses testing qPCR-positive for EHV-1 and absolute quantitation of EHV-1 in nasal secretions by qPCR between the two vaccine groups. The intranasal administration of two commercial EHV-1 vaccines did not elicit a systemic immune response. Further, vaccine derived EHV-1 could be detected in the majority of the intranasally vaccinated horses, potentially impacting diagnostic interpretation of EHV-1 during outbreak situations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses show that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) reduce child wasting and stunting. There is little information regarding effects on severe wasting or stunting. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the effect of SQ-LNSs on prevalence of severe wasting (weight-for-length z score < -3) and severe stunting (length-for-age z score < -3). METHODS: We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided to children 6-24 mo of age. We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with control and pooled the estimates using fixed-effects models. We used random-effects meta-regression to examine study-level effect modifiers. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether results differed depending on study arm inclusion criteria and types of comparisons. RESULTS: SQ-LNS provision led to a relative reduction of 31% in severe wasting [prevalence ratio (PR): 0.69; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.86; n = 34,373] and 17% in severe stunting (PR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.90; n = 36,795) at endline. Results were similar in most of the sensitivity analyses but somewhat attenuated when comparisons using passive control arms were excluded (PR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.96; n = 26,327 for severe wasting and PR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.95; n = 28,742 for severe stunting). Study-level characteristics generally did not significantly modify the effects of SQ-LNSs, but results suggested greater effects of SQ-LNSs in sites with greater burdens of wasting or stunting, or with poorer water quality or sanitation. CONCLUSIONS: Including SQ-LNSs in preventive interventions to promote healthy child growth and development is likely to reduce rates of severe wasting and stunting.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gestational weight gain (GWG) below or above the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations has been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Few studies have examined the effect of prenatal nutrient supplementations on GWG in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the effects of multiple micronutrient supplements (MMSs) and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) on GWG in LMICs. METHODS: A 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data was conducted to examine the effects of MMSs (45,507 women from 14 trials) and small-quantity LNSs (6237 women from 4 trials) on GWG compared with iron and folic acid supplements only. Percentage adequacy of GWG and total weight gain at delivery were calculated according to the IOM 2009 guidelines. Binary outcomes included severely inadequate (percentage adequacy <70%), inadequate (<90%), and excessive (>125%) GWG. Results from individual trials were pooled using fixed-effects inverse-variance models. Heterogeneity was examined using I2, stratified analysis, and meta-regression. RESULTS: MMSs resulted in a greater percentage adequacy of GWG [weighted mean difference (WMD): 0.86%; 95% CI: 0.28%, 1.44%; P < 0.01] and higher GWG at delivery (WMD: 209 g; 95% CI: 139, 280 g; P < 0.01) than among those in the control arm. Women who received MMSs had a 2.9% reduced risk of severely inadequate GWG (RR: 0.971; 95% CI: 0.956, 0.987; P < 0.01). No association was found between small-quantity LNSs and GWG percentage adequacy (WMD: 1.51%; 95% CI: -0.38%, 3.40%; P = 0.21). Neither MMSs nor small-quantity LNSs were associated with excessive GWG. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal MMSs were associated with greater GWG percentage adequacy and total GWG at delivery than was iron and folic acid only. This finding is consistent with previous results on birth outcomes and will inform policy development and local recommendations of switching routine prenatal iron and folic acid supplements to MMSs.",

        "abstract": "Inadequate diet and frequent symptomatic infections are considered major causes of growth stunting in low-income countries, but interventions targeting these risk factors have achieved limited success. Asymptomatic infections can restrict growth, but little is known about their role in global stunting prevalence. We investigated factors related to length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) at 24 months by constructing an interconnected network of various infections, biomarkers of inflammation (as assessed by alpha-1-acid glycoprotein [AGP]), and growth (insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1] and collagen X biomarker [CXM]) at 18 months, as well as other children, maternal, and household level factors. Among 604 children, there was a continuous decline in mean LAZ and increased mean length deficit from birth to 24 months. At 18 months of age, the percentage of asymptomatic children who carried each pathogen was: 84.5% enterovirus, 15.5% parechovirus, 7.7% norovirus, 4.6% rhinovirus, 0.6% rotavirus, 69.6% Campylobacter, 53.8% Giardia lamblia, 11.9% malaria parasites, 10.2% Shigella, and 2.7% Cryptosporidium. The mean plasma IGF-1 concentration was 12.5 ng/ml and 68% of the children had systemic inflammation (plasma AGP concentration >1 g/L). Shigella infection was associated with lower LAZ at 24 months through both direct and indirect pathways, whereas enterovirus, norovirus, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and malaria infections were associated with lower LAZ at 24 months indirectly, predominantly through increased systemic inflammation and reduced plasma IGF-1 and CXM concentration at 18 months.",

Pregnant adolescents constitute a nutritionally vulnerable group that could benefit from intervention to mitigate the mortality and adverse birth outcomes associated with adolescent pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the following: (1) the effect of multiple-micronutrient (MMN) supplementation vs iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation among adolescents on maternal morbidity, birth outcomes, and mortality outcomes, (2) the effects of MMN supplementation in adolescents compared with the effects in adult women, and (3) the effect modification, if any, of MMN supplementation by baseline and geographic characteristics of adolescents. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched, along with the reference lists of relevant reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Multiple-micronutrient supplementation trials in pregnancy that were conducted in a low- or middle-income country and had included at least 100 adolescents (10-19 years of age) were eligible for inclusion. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility. DATA EXTRACTION: Thirteen randomized controlled trials conducted in Africa and Asia were identified from 1792 reviews and 1578 original trials. Individual-level data was shared by study collaborators and was checked for completeness and extreme values. One- and two-stage individual participant data meta-analyses were conducted using data from randomized controlled trials of MMN supplementation. RESULTS: A total of 15 283 adolescents and 44 499 adult women with singleton births were included in the individual participant data meta-analyses of MMN supplementation vs IFA supplementation. In adolescents, MMN supplementation reduced low birth weight (1-stage OR = 0.87, 95%CI 0.77-0.97; 2-stage OR = 0.81; 95%CI 0.74-0.88), preterm birth (1-stage OR = 0.88, 95%CI 0.80-0.98; 2-stage OR = 0.86, 95%CI 0.79-0.95), and small-for-gestational-age births (1-stage OR = 0.90, 95%CI 0.81-1.00; 2-stage OR = 0.86, 95%CI 0.79-0.95) when compared with IFA supplementation. The effects of MMN supplementation did not differ between adolescents and older women, although a potentially greater reduction in small-for-gestational-age births was observed among adolescents. Effect modification by baseline characteristics and geographic region was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple-micronutrient supplementation can improve birth outcomes among pregnant adolescents in low- and middle-income countries. Policy related to antenatal care in these settings should prioritize MMN supplementation over the currently recommended IFA supplementation for all pregnant women, especially adolescents.",

        "abstract": "Methane (CH4) produced from enteric fermentation in ruminants has a noticeable impact on climate change. Prediction models are an alternative to current laborious and costly in vivo CH4 measurement techniques. The objectives of this study were to: (1) collate a database of individual sheep records from CH4 emission studies conducted in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region; (2) identify key variables for predicting CH4 production (g/d) and CH4 yield [g/kg of dry matter intake (DMI)]; (3) develop and cross-validate these newly-developed models; and (4) compare models’ predictive ability with equations currently used to support national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories in the LAC region. After removing outliers, the final database retained 219 individual sheep records from 11 studies, 48.2% of the original database. Models were developed using a sequential approach, by incrementally adding different variables with increasing complexity. Production and yield of CH4 were predicted by fitting mixed-effects models with a random effect of study. The predictive accuracy of fitted CH4 prediction models was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation. Overall, increasing model complexity improved the predictive performance of CH4 production and yield equations. Feed intake was the most important predictor of sheep CH4 production. Our best-developed CH4 production models outperformed Tier 2 equations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the growing lambs and mature sheep subsets, whereas they performed slightly worse in the complete subset. Methane yield can be predicted using dietary forage content only, or with an increased complexity model combining body weight, feeding level, and dietary forage content. The use of the newly-developed models rather than IPCC Tier 2 equations can substantially improve the accuracy of GHG inventories from LAC countries.",

In the present study prediction equations for enteric CH4 have been developed in lieu of expensive animal measurement approaches. Our objectives were to: (1) compile a dataset from individual beef cattle data for the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region; (2) determine main predictors of CH4 emission variables; (3) develop and cross-validate prediction models according to dietary forage content (DFC); and (4) compare the predictive ability of these newly-developed models with extant equations reported in literature, including those currently used for CH4 inventories in LAC countries. After outlier's screening, 1100 beef cattle observations from 55 studies were kept in the final dataset (∼ 50 % of the original dataset). Mixed-effects models were fitted with a random effect of study. The whole dataset was split according to DFC into a subset for all-forage (DFC = 100 %), high-forage (94 % ≥ DFC ≥ 54 %), and low-forage (50 % ≥ DFC) diets. Feed intake and average daily gain (ADG) were the main predictors of CH4 emission (g d-1), whereas this was feeding level [dry matter intake (DMI) as % of body weight] for CH4 yield (g kg-1 DMI). The newly-developed models were more accurate than IPCC Tier 2 equations for all subsets. Simple and multiple regression models including ADG were accurate and a feasible option to predict CH4 emission when data on feed intake are not available. Methane yield was not well predicted by any extant equation in contrast to the newly-developed models. The present study delivered new models that may be alternatives for the IPCC Tier 2 equations to improve CH4 prediction for beef cattle in inventories of LAC countries based either on more or less readily available data.",

        "abstract": "Ruminant livestock are an important source of anthropogenic methane (CH4). Decreasing the emissions of enteric CH4 from ruminant production is strategic to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C by 2050. Research in the area of enteric CH4 mitigation has grown exponentially in the last 2 decades, with various strategies for enteric CH4 abatement being investigated: production intensification, dietary manipulation (including supplementation and processing of concentrates and lipids, and management of forage and pastures), rumen manipulation (supplementation of ionophores, 3-nitrooxypropanol, macroalgae, alternative electron acceptors, and phytochemicals), and selection of low-CH4-producing animals. Other enteric CH4 mitigation strategies are at earlier stages of research but rapidly developing. Herein, we discuss and analyze the current status of available enteric CH4 mitigation strategies with an emphasis on opportunities and barriers to their implementation in confined and partial grazing production systems, and in extensive and fully grazing production systems. For each enteric CH4 mitigation strategy, we discuss its effectiveness to decrease total CH4 emissions and emissions on a per animal product basis, safety issues, impacts on the emissions of other greenhouse gases, as well as other economic, regulatory, and societal aspects that are key to implementation. Most research has been conducted with confined animals, and considerably more research is needed to develop, adapt, and evaluate antimethanogenic strategies for grazing systems. In general, few options are currently available for extensive production systems without feed supplementation. Continuous research and development are needed to develop enteric CH4 mitigation strategies that are locally applicable. Information is needed to calculate carbon footprints of interventions on a regional basis to evaluate the impact of mitigation strategies on net greenhouse gas emissions. Economically affordable enteric CH4 mitigation solutions are urgently needed. Successful implementation of safe and effective antimethanogenic strategies will also require delivery mechanisms and adequate technical support for producers, as well as consumer involvement and acceptance. The most appropriate metrics should be used in quantifying the overall climate outcomes associated with mitigation of enteric CH4 emissions. A holistic approach is required, and buy-in is needed at all levels of the supply chain.",

        "abstract": "Cross-talk between competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) may play a critical role in revealing potential mechanism of bovine follicular cysts. Ovarian cyst has always been an intractable scientific problem and has led to considerable economic losses to bovine breeding industry. However, its pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms are still not well understood. Here, this study aimed to investigate the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and the ceRNA networks in bovine follicular cyst. Whole transcriptome sequencing of bovine follicular granulosa cells (GCs) was conducted to obtain the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs. The results for the identified expressions of 8,003 mRNAs, 579 lncRNAs and 205 miRNAs were often altered between cystic and normal follicular GCs. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were performed on these differentially expressed mRNAs. Furthermore, the ceRNA network combining mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs using several bioinformatics methods based on co-expression analysis between the differentially expressed RNAs was conducted. Finally, the lncRNA NONBTAT027373.1-miR-664b-HSD17B7 pathway was verified by dual-luciferase reporting assay and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. LncRNA NONBTAT027373.1 sponged miR-664b in GCs and prevented miR-664b from binding to the HSD17B7 3'-UTR. These results indicated that genes and lncRNAs related to steroid hormone synthesis and energy metabolism could play important roles in the formation of bovine cystic follicles through the ceRNA mechanism and represent candidate targets for further research. This can be used as a practical guideline for promoting healthy and highly efficient development in the bovine industry.",

        "abstract": "Colloidal germanium (Ge) nanocrystals (NCs) are of great interest with possible applications for photovoltaics and near-IR detectors. In many examples of colloidal reactions, Ge(II) precursors are employed, and NCs of diameter ∼3-10 nm have been prepared. Herein, we employed a two-step microwave-assisted reduction of GeI4 in oleylamine (OAm) to prepare monodispersed Ge NCs with a size of 18.9 ± 1.84 nm. More importantly, the as-synthesized Ge NCs showed high crystallinity with single-crystal nature as indicated by powder X-ray diffraction, selected area electron diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The Tauc plot derived from photothermal deflection spectroscopy measurement on Ge NCs thin films shows a decreased bandgap of the Ge NCs obtained from GeI4 compared with that of the Ge NCs from GeI2 with a similar particle size, indicating a higher crystallinity of the samples prepared with the two-step reaction from GeI4. The calculated Urbach energy indicates less disorder in the larger NCs. This disorder might correlate with the fraction of surface states associated with decreased particle size or with the increased molar ratio of ligands to germanium. Solutions involved in this two-step reaction were investigated with 1H NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). One possible reaction pathway is proposed to unveil the details of the reaction involving GeI4 and OAm. Overall, this two-step synthesis produces high-quality Ge NCs and provides new insight on nanoparticle synthesis of covalently bonding semiconductors.",

First-principles computations show that the features in the electronic structures that have been identified to lead to high thermoelectric performances are present in Yb14ZnSb11, which has been presumed to be a poor thermoelectric material. We show that the previously reported low power factor of Yb14ZnSb11 is not intrinsic and is due to the presence of a Yb9Zn4+xSb9 impurity uniquely present in the Zn system. Phase-pure Yb14ZnSb11 synthesized through a route avoiding the impurity formation reveals its exceptional high-temperature thermoelectric properties, reaching a peak zT of 1.2 at 1175 K. Beyond Yb14ZnSb11, the favorable band structure features for thermoelectric performance are universal among the Ca14AlSb11 structure type, opening the possibility for high-performance thermoelectric materials.",

        "abstract": "Yb14MSb11 (M = Mg, Mn, Zn) are p-type Zintl phases with high thermoelectric efficiencies at 1000 °C and melting points above 1200 °C under vacuum and/or inert atmosphere. In a thermoelectric generator, even within a vacuum jacket, small amounts of oxygen may be present, and therefore, elucidating chemical reactions in the presence of air or oxygen provides a framework for engineering design. The oxidation of Yb14MSb11 was investigated from room temperature to 1000 °C in dry air with thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) on small pellets and visually after heat treatment to 1000 °C under ambient conditions on large pellets. Scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and powder X-ray diffraction provide identification of the oxidation products. In the presence of dry air, Yb14MSb11 initially oxidizes initially slowly at room temperature with a sweeping exotherm and weight gain with rapid oxidation at 400 °C, after which the exotherm signal plateaus at about 600 °C, with M = Zn showing the smallest overall exothermic curve. All samples showed a paired endo-/exotherm at 785-803 °C, consistent with the melting/solidification of YbSb2, which in the case of M = Mg, Mn extrudes from the sample. The various sections of the pellets─outer layer, inner layer, and core are analyzed, and oxidation reactions are proposed. After cycling to 1000 °C, the outer layer is composed of Yb2O3 with small amounts of the corresponding metal oxides. The inner layer shows delamination by inward diffusion of oxygen and outward diffusion of Sb or Sb oxide-containing phases, and the core shows Yb14MSb11. Yb14ZnSb11 shows the best resistance to oxidation and may provide a promising material for further passivation optimization.",

The solid solution Yb2-xEuxCdSb2 is an example of the promise these compounds hold, as one composition, Yb1.64Eu0.36CdSb2, has reported one of the highest zTs of any Zintl phase material at 525 K. The present study examines changes in structure and bonding of this solid solution that impacts thermoelectric performance. Pair distribution function analysis is combined with electronic structure modeling to take a chemical bonding-based approach to deconvolute the impact of defects on thermal and electronic properties in Yb2-xEuxCdSb2. Yb2-xEuxCdSb2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) samples were synthesized, and thermoelectric properties and defect chemistry were investigated. Samples from the middle of the series x = 0.2 and 0.3 were found to be the most highly defected, exhibiting Yb and Sb vacancies, as well as distortions in the Yb-Sb coordination spheres that correlate with thermoelectric properties. The highest efficiency is reported for x = 0.4 (zT ≈ 0.9 at 525 K), and the thermoelectric quality factor predicts that x = 0.3 could achieve zT > 2 by synthetically tuning the defect structure and thereby carrier concentration. The strategy of investigating local structure outlined in this study can be applied to a variety of other thermoelectric materials to provide insight into the hidden role of defect chemistry in understanding the structure-property relationships in extended solids.",

All the compounds in this solid solution series can be generated by progressively replacing Bi and a vacancy with Pb and Cu. Compositions in between the end members of the series possess complex disordered crystal structures with mixed occupied Bi/Pb and partially occupied Cu/vacancy sites. Density functional theory (DFT)-based phonon calculations suggest that these intrinsic structural attributes and presence of interstitial Cu lead to ultralow thermal conductivities less than 0.65 W m-1 K-1 between 300 and 700 K. All the compounds exhibit a narrow band gap below 1.0 eV confirmed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. DFT-based band structure analysis shows that the band gap decreases with the increasing amount of Cu and Pb substitution due to increased contribution of the Cu d states to the valence band. High-temperature charge transport properties indicate that electrons are the dominant charge carriers resulting in low electrical conductivities and relatively large Seebeck coefficients. A promising figure of merit, zT, of 0.21 for I has been achieved at 475 K.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Loss of retinoschisin (RS1) function underlies X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) pathology. In the retina, both photoreceptor inner segments and bipolar cells express RS1. However, the loss of RS1 function causes schisis primarily in the inner retina. To understand these cell type-specific phenotypes, we decoupled RS1 effects in bipolar cells from that in photoreceptors. METHODS: Bipolar cell transgene RS1 expression was achieved using two inner retina-specific promoters: (1) a minimal promoter engineered from glutamate receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 gene (mini-mGluR6/ Grm6) and (2) MiniPromoter (Ple155). Adeno-associated virus vectors encoding RS1 gene under either the mini-mGluR6 or Ple-155 promoter were delivered to the XLRS mouse retina through intravitreal or subretinal injection on postnatal day 14. Retinal structure and function were assessed 5 weeks later: immunohistochemistry for morphological characterization, optical coherence tomography and electroretinography (ERG) for structural and functional evaluation. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of RS1expression showed that expression with the MiniPromoter (Ple155) was heavily enriched in bipolar cells. Despite variations in vector penetrance and gene transfer efficiency across the injected retinas, those retinal areas with robust bipolar cell RS1 expression showed tightly packed bipolar cells with fewer cavities and marked improvement in inner retinal structure and synaptic function as judged by optical coherence tomography and electroretinography, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that RS1 gene expression primarily in bipolar cells of the XLRS mouse retina, independent of photoreceptor expression, can ameliorate retinoschisis structural pathology and provide further evidence of RS1 role in cell adhesion.",

        "abstract": "We generated a Long Evans transgenic rat with targeted deletion of the whole Rs1 exon-1 and evaluated the pathological retinal phenotype of this Rs1-/Y rat model of X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS). The Rs1-/Y rat exhibited very early onset and rapidly progressive photoreceptor degeneration. The outer limiting membrane (OLM) was disrupted and discontinuous by post-natal day (P15) and allowed photoreceptor nuclei to dislocate from the outer nuclear layers (ONL) into the sub-retinal side of the OLM. Dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) a-wave and b-wave amplitudes were considerably reduced to only 20-25% of WT by P17. Microglia and Müller glial showed cell marker activation by P7. Intravitreal application of AAV8-RS1 at P5-6 induced RS1 expression by P15 and rescued the inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL) cavity formation otherwise present at P15, and the outer-retinal structure was less disrupted. This Rs1-/Y exon-1-del rat model displays substantially faster rod cell loss compared to the exon-1-del Rs1-KO mouse. Most unexpected was the rapid appearance of schisis cavities between P7 and P15, and then cavities rapidly disappeared by P21/P30. The rat model provides clues on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying XLRS pathology in this model and points to a substantial and early changes to normal retinal development.",

        "abstract": "Breast tissue enhances on contrast MRI and is called background parenchymal enhancement (BPE). Having high BPE has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. We examined the relationship between BPE and the amount of fibroglandular tissue on MRI (MRI-FGT) and breast cancer risk factors. This was a cross-sectional study of 415 women without breast cancer undergoing contrast-enhanced breast MRI at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. All women completed a questionnaire assessing exposures at the time of MRI. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) describing the relationship between breast cancer risk factors and BPE and MRI-FGT were generated using modified Poisson regression. In multivariable-adjusted models a positive association between body mass index (BMI) and BPE was observed, with a 5-unit increase in BMI associated with a 14% and 44% increase in prevalence of high BPE in pre- and post-menopausal women, respectively. Conversely, a strong inverse relationship between BMI and MRI-FGT was observed in both pre- (PR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57, 0.76) and post-menopausal (PR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.56, 0.78) women. Use of preventive medication (e.g., tamoxifen) was associated with having low BPE, while no association was observed for MRI-FGT. BPE is an imaging marker available from standard contrast-enhanced MRI, that is influenced by endogenous and exogenous hormonal exposures in both pre- and post-menopausal women.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To assess the incidence of benign and malignant peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in women with silicone implants who are being screened for silent implant rupture. METHODS: The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study and waived informed consent. Women who underwent silicone implant oncoplastic and/or cosmetic surgery and postoperative implant-protocol MRI from 2000 to 2014 were included. Peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses were measured volumetrically. A benign peri-implant fluid collection and/or mass was pathologically proven or defined as showing 2 years of imaging and/or clinical stability. A malignant peri-implant fluid collection was pathologically proven. Incidence of peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated on a per-patient level using proportions and exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Fisher's exact test was used in the analysis to test statistical significance pre-defined as P-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1070 women with silicone implants were included (mean age, 50.7 years; range, 40.4-53.8). Median time between reconstructive surgery and first MRI was 88.9 months (range, 0.8-1363.3). Eighteen women (1.7%) had a peri-implant fluid collection and/or mass: 15/18 (83.3%) had adequate follow-up; and only 1/15 was malignant implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, with a PPV of 6.7% (95% CI: 0.003-0.0005). The median peri-implant fluid collection size was 89 mL (range, 18-450 mL). CONCLUSION: Peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses identified at silicone implant protocol breast MR imaging are rarely seen 24 months after reconstructive surgery. Image-guided fine-needle aspiration with flow cytometry may be warranted to evaluate for implant-associated lymphoma.",

        "abstract": "Here we develop a tool to predict resectability of HER2+ breast cancer at breast conservation surgery (BCS) utilizing features identified on preoperative breast MRI. We identified patients with HER2+ breast cancer who obtained pre-operative breast MRI and underwent BCS between 2002-2013. From the contoured tumor on pre-operative MRI, shape, histogram, and co-occurrence and size zone matrix texture features were extracted. In univariate analysis, Spearman's correlation coefficient (Rs) was used to assess the correlation between each image feature and an endpoint (surgical re-excision). For multivariate modeling, we employed a support vector machine (SVM) method in a manner of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Of 109 patients with HER2+breast cancer who underwent BCS, 39% underwent surgical re-excision. 62% had residual cancer at re-excision. In univariate analysis, solidity (Rs = -0.32, p = 0.009) and extent (Rs = -0.29, p = 0.019) were significantly associated with re-excision. Skewness in post-contrast 1, 2, and 3 (Rs = 0.25, p = 0.045; Rs = 0.30, p = 0.015; Rs = 0.28, p = 0.026) and kurtosis in post-contrast 1 (Rs = 0.26, p = 0.035) were also statistically significant. LOOCV-based SVM test achieved 74.4% specificity and 71.4% sensitivity when 21 features were used. Thus, tumor texture, histogram and morphological MRI features may assist surgical planning, encouraging wide margins or mastectomy in patients who may otherwise go on to re-excision.",

        "abstract": "Background There is considerable interest in the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in mammographic screening. However, it is essential to critically evaluate the performance of AI before it can become a modality used for independent mammographic interpretation. Purpose To evaluate the reported standalone performances of AI for interpretation of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published from January 2017 to June 2022. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were reviewed. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and Comparative (QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C, respectively). A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed for overall studies and for different study types (reader studies vs historic cohort studies) and imaging techniques (digital mammography vs DBT). Results In total, 16 studies that include 1 108 328 examinations in 497 091 women were analyzed (six reader studies, seven historic cohort studies on digital mammography, and four studies on DBT). Pooled AUCs were significantly higher for standalone AI than radiologists in the six reader studies on digital mammography (0.87 vs 0.81, P = .002), but not for historic cohort studies (0.89 vs 0.96, P = .152). Four studies on DBT showed significantly higher AUCs in AI compared with radiologists (0.90 vs 0.79, P < .001). Higher sensitivity and lower specificity were seen for standalone AI compared with radiologists. Conclusion Standalone AI for screening digital mammography performed as well as or better than radiologists. Compared with digital mammography, there is an insufficient number of studies to assess the performance of AI systems in the interpretation of DBT screening examinations. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a family caregiver-reported survey that assesses family-centeredness of care in the context of pediatric emergency department (ED) encounters. METHODS: We created a caregiver-reported scale, incorporated content expert feedback, and iteratively revised it based on cognitive interviews with caregivers. We then field tested the scale in a survey with caregivers. We dichotomized items using top-box scoring and obtained a summary score per respondent. Using a sample of 191 caregivers recruited from 9 EDs, we analyzed internal consistency reliability, dimensionality via item response theory modeling, and convergent validity with the ED Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. RESULTS: Feedback from the 9 experts led us to remove 4 items. We conducted 16 cognitive interviews and revised the survey in 4 rounds. An 11-item survey was field tested. Mean (standard deviation) respondent 11-item summary score was 77.2 (26.6). We removed 2 items given inconsistent response patterns, poor variability, and poor internal consistency, which increased coefficient alpha from 0.85 to 0.88 for the final scale. A multidimensional model fit the data best, but factor scores correlated strongly with summary scores, suggesting the latter are sufficient for quality improvement and future research. Regarding convergent validity, adjusted partial correlation between our scale's 9-item summary score and the ED CAHPS summary score was 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.67-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric analyses demonstrated strong item performance, reliability, and convergent validity for the 9-item scale. This survey can be used to assess family-centered care in the ED for research and quality improvement purposes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Noninvasive telemonitoring and nurse telephone coaching (NTM-NTC) is a promising postdischarge strategy in heart failure (HF). Comorbid conditions and disease burden influence health outcomes in HF, but how comorbidity burden modulates the effectiveness of NTM-NTC is unknown. This study aims to identify patients with HF who may benefit from postdischarge NTM-NTC based on their burden of comorbidity. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the Better Effectiveness After Transition - Heart Failure trial, patients hospitalized for acute decompensated HF were randomized to postdischarge NTM-NTC or usual care. In this secondary analysis of 1313 patients with complete data, comorbidity burden was assessed by scoring complication and coexisting diagnoses from index admissions. Clinical outcomes included 30-day and 180-day readmissions, mortality, days alive, and combined days alive and out of the hospital. Patients had a mean of 5.7 comorbidities and were stratified into low (0-2), moderate (3-8), and high comorbidity (≥9) subgroups. Increased comorbidity burden was associated with worse outcomes. NTM-NTC was not associated with readmission rates in any comorbidity subgroup. Among high comorbidity patients, NTM-NTC was associated with significantly lower mortality at 30 days (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.90) and 180 days (hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.98), as well as more days alive (160.1 vs 140.3, P = .029) and days alive out of the hospital (152.0 vs 133.2, P = .044) compared with usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Postdischarge NTM-NTC improved survival among patients with HF with a high comorbidity burden. Comorbidity burden may be useful for identifying patients likely to benefit from this management strategy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children presenting to emergency departments of community hospitals may require transfer to a children's hospital for more definitive care, but the transfer process can be distressing and burdensome to patients, families, and the healthcare system. Using telehealth to bring the children's hospital nurse virtually to the bedside of the child in the emergency department has the potential to promote family-centered care and minimize triage issues and other transfer-associated burdens. To explore the feasibility of the nurse-to-family telehealth intervention, we are conducting a pilot study. METHODS: This parallel cluster randomized controlled feasibility and pilot trial will randomize six community emergency departments to use either nurse-to-family telehealth (intervention) or usual care (control) for pediatric inter-facility transfers. All eligible children presenting to a participating site during the study period who require inter-facility transfer will be included. Eligibility requires that there be an English-speaking adult parent or guardian at the emergency department bedside. We will examine feasibility objectives that assess protocol assignment adherence, fidelity, and survey response rates. We will measure subject-level exploratory outcome data to test feasibility of data collection and to obtain effect size estimates; exploratory outcomes include family-centered care, family experience, parent acute stress, parent distress, and change in level of care. Additionally, we will conduct a mixed methods implementation evaluation using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework. DISCUSSION: The findings from this trial will increase our understanding about nurse-to-family telehealth during pediatric transfers. The mixed methods implementation evaluation will provide relevant insight about the contextual factors that influence the implementation and rigorous evaluation of our intervention.

The use of telehealth to bring a family member virtually to the child's bedside during hospital rounds is a promising solution. We aim to evaluate the impact of virtual family-centered hospital rounds in the neonatal intensive care unit on parental and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will randomize families of hospitalized infants to have the option to use telehealth for virtual hospital rounds (intervention) or usual care (control).

All eligible infants who are admitted to this single-site neonatal intensive care unit during the study period will be included. Eligibility requires that there be an English-proficient adult parent or guardian. We will measure participant-level outcome data to test the impact on family-centered rounds attendance, parent experience, family-centered care, parent activation, parent health-related quality of life, length of stay, breastmilk feeding, and neonatal growth. Additionally, we will conduct a mixed methods implementation evaluation using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework.

        "abstract": "Background: Family-centered rounds is recognized as a best practice for hospitalized children, but it has only been possible for children whose families can physically be at the bedside during hospital rounds. The use of telehealth to bring a family member virtually to the childâ€™s bedside during rounds is a promising solution. We aim to evaluate the impact of virtual family-centered rounds in the neonatal intensive care unit on parental and neonatal outcomes. Methods: This two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will randomize families of hospitalized infants to have the option to use telehealth for virtual rounds (intervention) or usual care (control). The intervention-arm families will also have the option to participate in rounds in-person or to not participate in rounds. All eligible infants who are admitted to this single-site neonatal intensive care unit during the study period will be included. Eligibility requires that there be an English-proficient adult parent or guardian. We will measure participant-level outcome data to test the impact on family-centered rounds attendance, parent experience, family-centered care, parent activation, parent health-related quality of life, length of stay, breastmilk feeding, and neonatal growth. Additionally, we will conduct a mixed methods implementation evaluation using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework. Discussion: The findings from this trial will increase our understanding about virtual family-centered rounds in the neonatal intensive care unit. The mixed methods implementation evaluation will enhance our understanding about the contextual factors that influence the implementation and rigorous evaluation of our intervention.

        "abstract": "The effects of selenium (Se) on plant metabolism have been reported in several studies triggering plant tolerance to abiotic stresses, yet, the effects of Se on coffee plants under chilling stress are unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of foliar Se application on coffee seedlings submitted to chilling stress and subsequent plant recovery. Two Coffea species, Coffea arabica cv. Arara, and Coffea canephora clone 31, were submitted to foliar application of sodium selenate solution (0.4 mg plant-1) or a control foliar solution, then on day 2 plants were submitted to low temperature (10°C day/4°C night) for 2 days. After that, the temperature was restored to optimal (25°C day/20°C night) for 2 days. Leaf samples were collected three times (before, during, and after the chilling stress) to perform analyses. After the chilling stress, visual leaf injury was observed in both species; however, the damage was twofold higher in C. canephora. The lower effect of cold on C. arabica was correlated to the increase in ascorbate peroxidase and higher content of starch, sucrose, and total soluble sugars compared with C. canephora, as well as a reduction in reducing sugars and proline content during the stress and rewarming. Se increased the nitrogen and sulfur content before stress but reduced their content during low temperature. The reduced content of nitrogen and sulfur during stress indicates that they were remobilized to stem and roots. Se supply reduced the damage in C. canephora leaves by 24% compared with the control. However, there was no evidence of the Se effects on antioxidant enzymatic pathways or ROS activity during stress as previously reported in the literature. Se increased the content of catalase during the rewarming. Se foliar supply also increased starch, amino acids, and proline, which may have reduced symptom expression in C. canephora in response to low temperature. In conclusion, Se foliar application can be used as a strategy to improve coffee tolerance under low-temperature changing nutrient remobilization, carbohydrate metabolism, and catalase activity in response to rewarming stress, but C. arabica and C. canephora respond differently to chilling stress and Se supply.",

        "abstract": "Female carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) BRCA1/2 variants are at increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Currently, the only effective strategy for ovarian cancer risk reduction is risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RR-BSO), which carries adverse effects related to early menopause. There is ongoing investigation of inhibition of the RANK ligand (RANKL) with denosumab as a means of chemoprevention for breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1 P/LP variants. Through the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) Early Phase Clinical Trials Prevention Consortia, a presurgical pilot study of denosumab was developed in premenopausal carriers of P/LP BRCA1/2 variants scheduled for RR-BSO with the goal of collecting valuable data on the biologic effects of denosumab on gynecologic tissue. The study was terminated early due to the inability to accrue participants. Challenges which impacted the conduct of this study included a study design with highly selective eligibility criteria and requirements and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical to reflect on these issues to enhance the successful completion of future prevention studies in individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes.",

        "abstract": "The collective dynamics of chaotic oscillators has drawn considerable attention in numerous fields, including agriculture and forestry. The alternate bearing of tree crops is a phenomenon in which a year of heavy yield is followed by a year of light yield. This phenomenon has been conventionally investigated using a tent map known as a resource budget model. Alternate fruiting is caused by strong synchronisation among trees in an orchard and is a major problem in fruit growing. To develop control methods for alternate fruiting, it is essential to understand the strength of synchronisation at the individual and population levels of trees in orchards and the mechanism of alternate fruiting. In this study, in-phase/out-of-phase analysis was applied to the yield data of a 9562 pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) population, and the phase transitions and mode-locking in the orchard were revealed. Using a developed network model consisting of diffusively coupled chaotic oscillators on which common noise was imposed identically, the phase transitions, mode-locking, and 1/3 power-law scaling spatial correlation were confirmed mathematically. Furthermore, the manner in which three essential factors, i.e. common noise, direct coupling, and the cropping coefficient gradient, explain the spatial synchrony of the orchard was elucidated. The proposed methodology based on nonlinear dynamics would be useful for pomology, forestry, and ecosystem management.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early onset, developmental disorder whose genetic cause is heterogeneous and complex. In total, 70% of ASD cases are due to an unknown etiology. Among the monogenic causes of ASD, fragile X syndrome (FXS) accounts for 2-4% of ASD cases, and 60% of individuals with FXS present with ASD. Epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, which modulates gene expression levels, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both disorders. Thus, in this study, using the Human Methylation EPIC Bead Chip, we examined the global DNA methylation profiles of biological samples derived from 57 age-matched male participants (2-6 years old), including 23 subjects with ASD, 23 subjects with FXS with ASD (FXSA) and 11 typical developing (TD) children. After controlling for technical variation and white blood cell composition, using the conservatory threshold of the false discovery rate (FDR ≤ 0.05), in the three comparison groups, TD vs. AD, TD vs. FXSA and ASD vs. FXSA, we identified 156, 79 and 3100 differentially methylated sites (DMS), and 14, 13 and 263 differential methylation regions (DMRs). Interestingly, several genes differentially methylated among the three groups were among those listed in the SFARI Gene database, including the PAK2, GTF2I and FOXP1 genes important for brain development. Further, enrichment analyses identified pathways involved in several functions, including synaptic plasticity. Our preliminary study identified a significant role of altered DNA methylation in the pathology of ASD and FXS, suggesting that the characterization of a DNA methylation signature may help to unravel the pathogenicity of FXS and ASD and may help the development of an improved diagnostic classification of children with ASD and FXSA. In addition, it may pave the way for developing therapeutic interventions that could reverse the altered methylome profile in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Nearly half of men with FMR1 premutation develop a neurodegenerative disorder; Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). In this syndrome, cognitive executive decline and psychiatric changes may co-occur with major motor features, and in this study, we explored the interrelationships between these three domains in a sample of adult males affected with FXTAS. A sample of 23 adult males aged between 48 and 80 years (mean = 62.3; SD = 8.8), carrying premutation expansions between 45 and 118 CGG repeats, and affected with FXTAS, were included in this study. We employed a battery of cognitive assessments, two standard motor rating scales, and two self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms. When controlling for age and/or educational level, where appropriate, there were highly significant correlations between motor rating score for ICARS gait domain, and the scores representing global cognitive decline (ACE-III), processing speed (SDMT), immediate memory (Digit Span), and depression and anxiety scores derived from both SCL90 and DASS instruments. Remarkably, close relationships of UPDRS scores, representing the contribution of Parkinsonism to FXTAS phenotypes, were exclusive to psychiatric scores. Highly significant relationships between CGG repeat size and most scores for three phenotypic domains suggest a close tracking with genetic liability. These findings of relationships between a constellation of phenotypic domains in male PM carriers with FXTAS are reminiscent of other conditions associated with disruption to cerebro-cerebellar circuits.",

The structure of ASFMR1 gene is still uncharacterized and it is currently unknown how many isoforms of the gene are expressed and at what level in premutation carriers (PM) and if they may contribute to the premutation pathology. In this study, we characterized the ASFMR1 gene structure and the transcriptional landscape by using PacBio SMRT sequencing with target enrichment (IDT customized probe panel). We identified 45 ASFMR1 isoforms ranging in sizes from 523 bp to 6 Kb, spanning approximately 59 kb of genomic DNA. Multiplexing and sequencing of six human brain samples from PM samples and normal control (HC) were carried out on the PacBio Sequel platform. We validated the presence of these isoforms by qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing and characterized the acceptor and donor splicing site consensus sequences. Consistent with previous studies conducted in other tissue types, we found a high expression of ASFMR1 isoform Iso131bp in brain samples of PM as compared to HC, while no differences in expression levels were observed for the newly identified isoforms IsoAS1 and IsoAS2. We investigated the role of the splicing regulatory protein Sam68 which we did not observe in the alternative splicing of the ASFMR1 gene. Our study provides a useful insight into the structure of ASFMR1 gene and transcriptional landscape along with the expression pattern of various newly identified novel isoforms and on their potential role in premutation pathology.",

        "abstract": "In combination with studies of post-mortem Parkinson's disease (PD) brains, pharmacological and genetic models of PD have suggested that two fundamental interacting cellular processes are impaired - proteostasis and mitochondrial respiration. We have re-examined the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in lymphoblasts isolated from individuals with idiopathic PD and an age-matched control group. As previously reported for various PD cell types, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by PD lymphoblasts was significantly elevated. However, this was not due to an impairment of mitochondrial respiration, as is often assumed. Instead, basal mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis are dramatically elevated in PD lymphoblasts. The mitochondrial mass, genome copy number and membrane potential were unaltered, but the expression of indicative respiratory complex proteins was also elevated. This explains the increased oxygen consumption rates by each of the respiratory complexes in experimentally uncoupled mitochondria of iPD cells. However, it was not attributable to increased activity of the stress- and energy-sensing protein kinase AMPK, a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. The respiratory differences between iPD and control cells were sufficiently dramatic as to provide a potentially sensitive and reliable biomarker of the disease state, unaffected by disease duration (time since diagnosis) or clinical severity. Lymphoblasts from control and PD individuals thus occupy two distinct, quasi-stable steady states; a 'normal' and a 'hyperactive' state characterized by two different metabolic rates. The apparent stability of the 'hyperactive' state in patient-derived lymphoblasts in the face of patient ageing, ongoing disease and mounting disease severity suggests an early, permanent switch to an alternative metabolic steady state. With its associated, elevated ROS production, the 'hyperactive' state might not cause pathology to cells that are rapidly turned over, but brain cells might accumulate long-term damage leading ultimately to neurodegeneration and the loss of mitochondrial function observed post-mortem. Whether the 'hyperactive' state in lymphoblasts is a biomarker specifically of PD or more generally of neurodegenerative disease remains to be determined.",

        "abstract": "Typing of both SAHH and ADA red cell electrophoretic patterns was carried out among the members of about 80 families from Latium (Central Italy) and in a random sample of about 350 individuals from two Italian regions, Latium and Sardinia. 1. The SAHH1 enzyme product provided another interesting example of a change in the electrophoretic pattern brought about by the haemolysate ageing. In vitro storage of SAHH 1 red cell lysates leads to the production of a pattern similar to that expected from a heterozygote SAHH 2-1. This change has been shown to be abolished by pretreating the sample with mercaptoethanol. The results indicate that the systematic use of sulphydril reducing agents can provide a more reliable means of analysing the SAHH polymorphism if differently stored samples are to be compared by starch gel electrophoresis. 2. Evidence against complete linkage of the SAHH and ADA loci has been obtained from two informative SAHH/ADA matings encountered in this study. 3. The SAHH allele frequencies observed in the two samples analysed were: SAHH1 = 0.969, SAHH2 = 0.024, SAHH3 = 0.007 (Latium) and SAHH1 = 0.973, SAHH2 = 0.011, SAHH3 = 0.016 (Sardinia). 4. The ADA2 allele frequency estimates were: 0.083 (Latium) and 0.059 (Sardinia). These figures are almost identical to those already reported for the same two regions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study assessed the national impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the education of medical students assigned to surgery clerkship rotations, as reported by surgery clerkship directors (CDs). STUDY DESIGN: In the spring of 2020 and 2021, the authors surveyed 164 CDs from 144 Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited US medical schools about their views of the pandemic's impact on the surgery clerkship curriculum, students' experiences, outcomes, and institutional responses. RESULTS: Overall survey response rates, calculated as number of respondents/number of surveyed, were 44.5% (73 of 164) and 50.6% (83 of 164) for the spring 2020 and 2021 surveys, respectively. Nearly all CDs (more than 95%) pivoted to virtual platforms and solutions. Most returned to some form of in-person learning by winter 2020, and prepandemic status by spring 2021 (46%, 38 of 83). Students' progression to the next year was delayed by 12% (9 of 73), and preparation was negatively impacted by 45% (37 of 83). Despite these data, CDs perceived students' interest in surgical careers was not significantly affected (89% vs 77.0%, p = 0.09). During the 1-year study, the proportion of CDs reporting a severe negative impact on the curriculum dropped significantly (p < 0.0001) for most parameters assessed except summative evaluations (40.3% vs 45.7%, p = 0.53). CDs (n = 83) also noted the pandemic's positive impact with respect to virtual patient encounters (21.7%), didactics (16.9%), student test performance (16.9%), continuous personal learning (14.5%), engagement in the clerkship (9.6%), and student interest in surgery as a career (7.2%). CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, the severe negative impact on student educational programs lessened, and novel virtual curricular solutions emerged. Student interest in surgery as a career was sustained. Measures of student competency and effectiveness of new curriculum, including telehealth, remain areas for future investigation.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if computed tomographic lymphangiography (CTL) after ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of intrahepatic iopamidol (Isovue 370) in healthy cats would safely and effectively lead to opacification of the hepatic lymphatics, cisterna chyli, and thoracic ducts (TDs). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective pilot study design with randomization of the sides of the liver injected. SAMPLE POPULATION: 6 purpose-bred cats. PROCEDURES: Cats were anesthetized and based on random assignment, and the left or right liver was injected with iodinated contrast material. CTL images were taken at 5, 10, and 15 minutes postinjection to determine the quality of opacification of the cisterna chyli and TDs. RESULTS: Eleven hepatic injections from 6 cats were available for review. One CT file was corrupted and unusable. Seven out of 11 hepatic contrast injections yielded a diagnostic study. Five out of 11 were graded as excellent, 0/11 were graded as good, and 2/11 were graded as fair. Opacification of the cisterna chyli and TDs was absent in 4/11 studies. Three out of 6 cats had mild to moderate increases in hepatocellular enzymes when assayed 3 months postprocedure. The hepatic lymphatics, cisterna chyli, and TDs were opacified in all studies deemed diagnostic. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Intrahepatic contrast injection offers a novel portal for thoracic duct lymphangiography that documents the hepatic contribution to the mesenteric lymphatics, cisterna chyli, and thoracic duct. The procedure may be helpful in the preoperative diagnostic evaluation of cats with chylothorax.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe complications and outcomes of dogs undergoing thoracoscopic-assisted (TA) lung lobectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional, retrospective study. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs (n = 30). METHODS: Medical records of dogs that underwent TA lung lobectomy were reviewed. Signalment, bodyweight, clinical signs, imaging findings, surgical variables, complications, and short-term/long-term outcome were assessed. Thoracoscopic-assisted lung lobectomy was performed with a mini-thoracotomy. RESULTS: Twelve intraoperative complications were recorded in 11 dogs, 6 requiring conversion to open thoracotomy. Reasons for conversion were reported in 5/6 dogs and included adhesions (2), difficultly manipulating the lesion through the mini-thoracotomy (2), and acute oxygen desaturation (1). One lung ventilation was successful in 4 of the 7 dogs in which this was attempted. A linear stapling device (DST series Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) was used for lung lobe ligation in 14 dogs. Twenty-three dogs underwent surgery for a neoplastic lesion, with 19 of these being carcinoma. The median lesion size was 4.3 cm (range 1-10 cm); margins were clean, except in 1 dog. Complications were documented in 8 dogs prior to discharge, 5 of these being classified as mild. Twenty-nine dogs were discharged at a median of 47 h postoperatively (range 24-120 h). Death was reported in 9 dogs, with a median survival time of 168 days (range 70-868 days). CONCLUSION: Thoracoscopic-assisted lung lobectomy was achieved with few major complications in the population reported here. Dogs were able to be discharged from hospital quickly, with most surviving beyond the follow-up period. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Thoracoscopic-assisted lung lobectomy may be considered to facilitate the excision of larger pulmonary lesions or to treat smaller dogs, in which a thoracoscopic excision may be technically more challenging.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report the perioperative characteristics and outcomes of dogs undergoing laparoscopic-assisted splenectomy (LAS). ANIMALS: 136 client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES: Multicentric retrospective study. Medical records of dogs undergoing LAS for treatment of naturally occurring splenic disease from January 1, 2014, to July 31, 2020, were reviewed. History, signalment, physical examination and preoperative diagnostic test results, procedural information, complications, duration of hospitalization, histopathologic diagnosis, and perioperative outcomes were recorded. Perioperative complications were defined using the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (VCOG-CTCAE v2) guidelines. RESULTS: LAS was performed for treatment of a splenic mass (124/136 [91%]), immune-mediated disease (7/136 [5%]), splenomegaly (4/136 [3%]), or immune-mediated disease in conjunction with a splenic mass (1/136 [1%]). Median splenic mass size was 1.3 cm3/kg body weight. Conversion to open laparotomy occurred in 5.9% (8/136) of dogs. Complications occurred in 78 dogs, with all being grade 2 or lower. Median surgical time was 47 minutes, and median postoperative hospital stay was 28 hours. All but 1 dog survived to discharge, the exception being postoperative death due to a suspected portal vein thrombus. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the dogs of this report, LAS was associated with low rates of major complications, morbidity, and mortality when performed for a variety of splenic pathologies. Minimally invasive surgeons can consider the LAS technique to perform total splenectomy in dogs without hemoabdomen and with spleens with modest-sized splenic masses up to 55.2 cm3/kg, with minimal rates of complications, morbidity, and mortality.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, perioperative protocols, and outcomes in dogs diagnosed with ventricular fibrillation (VF) while undergoing pericardiectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, multi-institutional study. ANIMALS: Sixteen client-owned dogs. METHODS: Cases were accrued through a listserve request posted to 3 subspecialty veterinary societies. Dogs were included if they developed VF during a pericardiectomy performed through an open or thoracoscopic approach. Data collected included signalment, history and physical examination, surgical approach, histopathology, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Indications for pericardiectomy included idiopathic chylothorax (n = 7), neoplasia (4), idiopathic pericardial effusion (4), and foreign body granuloma (1). Surgical approaches included thoracoscopy (12), intercostal thoracotomy (3) and median sternotomy (1). Electrosurgical devices were used to complete at least part of the pericardiectomy in 15 of 16 dogs. Ventricular fibrillation appeared to be initiated during electrosurgical use in 8/15 dogs. However, in 5/15 dogs it was not obviously associated with electrosurgical use. In 3/16 dogs the timing of initiation of VF was unclear. In 7/16 dogs, cardiac arrhythmias were noted prior to the development of VF. Fourteen of 16 dogs died from intraoperative VF. CONCLUSION: In most dogs ventricular fibrillation was a fatal complication of pericardiectomy. Ventricular fibrillation might be associated with the use of electrosurgical devices and cardiac manipulation during pericardiectomy although a causal link could not be established from the data in this study. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Surgeons must be aware of the risk of VF during pericardial surgery. Electrosurgery might need to be used judiciously during pericardiectomy, particularly in dogs exhibiting cardiac arrythmias.",

The medical records of 2 dogs with pelvic bladder which underwent laparoscopic cystopexy, and 1 dog which underwent laparoscopic-assisted cystopexy were reviewed. Data retrieved included signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical technique, and clinical outcome. Long-term follow-up was obtained by verbal interviews with owners. Laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted cystopexy was successfully performed to reposition the urinary bladder within the abdominal cavity in all dogs. An intracorporeal suture technique was used in 2 dogs, whereas an extracorpreal technique was used in 1 dog. Two dogs with stranguria experienced complete resolution immediately following surgery and remained disease-free at 18 mo after cystopexy. A third dog with urinary incontinence subjectively improved (according to the owner) but had not resolved completely 2 d following surgery. Key clinical message: Laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted cystopexy may be an effective treatment for pelvic bladder in dogs and may offer a minimally invasive alternative to laparotomy. Male dogs with stranguria as the primary clinical sign may experience complete resolution following cystopexy.",

        "abstract": "Social isolation is associated with adverse health outcomes in the general older adult population, but little is known about indicators of social isolation in family caregiver populations. This cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of social isolation in the 2015 National Survey of Caregiving. Using the Convoy Model of social relations, a life-course social support framework, we also examined associations between social isolation and caregiver self-reported health. Using multiple ordinal logistic regression models, we examined social isolation - operationalised with a five-item summative measure and, alternatively, with each social isolation item - as a predictor of self-reported general health status. On the dichotomised summative measure, 24.74% (n = 2,175) were more isolated. Younger caregivers were more isolated (M = 56.77 years, SE = 0.76) compared with those who were not (M = 60.86 years, SE = 0.41). Self-reported general health was as follows: 4.93% poor; 15.67% fair; 25.62% good; 34.81% very good and 18.97% excellent. Less social isolation was associated with higher odds of better self-reported health (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.19; CI = 1.05-1.35). Of the individual social isolation indicators, only a lack of community participation was associated with higher odds of worse self-reported health (AOR = 1.57; CI = 1.25-1.97). Social isolation and particularly community participation were associated with caregiver health status. It may be necessary for healthcare providers to consider these factors in caregiver health assessments. Future research is recommended to understand the consequences of various social isolation indicators in diverse samples including younger caregivers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer are often advised to begin screening when they are 10 years younger than the age at which their relative was diagnosed. Evidence is lacking to determine how much earlier they should begin. METHODS: Using Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data on screening mammograms from 1996 to 2016, the authors constructed a cohort of 306,147 women 30-59 years of age with information on first-degree family history of breast cancer and relative's age at diagnosis. The authors compared cumulative 5-year breast cancer incidence among women with and without a first-degree family history of breast by relative's age at diagnosis and by screening age. RESULTS: Among 306,147 women included in the study, approximately 11% reported a first-degree family history of breast cancer with 3885 breast cancer cases identified. Women reporting a relative diagnosed between 40 and 49 years and undergoing screening between ages 30 and 39 or 40 and 49 had similar 5-year cumulative incidences of breast cancer (respectively, 18.6/1000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.1, 25.7; 18.4/1000; 95% CI, 13.7, 23.5) as women without a family history undergoing screening between 50-59 years of age (18.0/1000; 95% CI, 17.0, 19.1). For relative's diagnosis age from 35 to 45 years of age, initiating screening 5-8 years before diagnosis age resulted in a 5-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer of 15.2/1000, that of an average 50-year-old woman. CONCLUSION: Women with a relative diagnosed at or before age 45 may wish to consider, in consultation with their provider, initiating screening 5-8 years earlier than their relative's diagnosis age.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Little is known about women's confidence in their breast cancer screening. We sought to characterize breast cancer screening confidence by imaging modality and clinically assessed breast density. Materials and Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional survey of women ages 40-74 years who received digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and/or breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a normal screening exam in the prior year. The main outcome was women's confidence (Very, Somewhat, A little, Not at all) in their breast cancer screening detecting any cancer. Multivariable logistic regression identified correlates of being very confident in breast cancer screening by screening modality group: Group 1) DM vs. DBT and Group 2) DM or DBT alone vs. with supplemental MRI. Results: Overall, 2329 of 7439 (31.3%) invitees participated, with 30%-61% being very confident in their screening across modality and density subgroups. Having dense versus nondense breasts was associated with lower odds of being very confident (Group 1: odds ratio [OR]: 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.79; Group 2: OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.40-0.79). There were no differences by modality within Group 1, but for Group 2, women undergoing MRI had higher odds of being very confident (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.21-2.37). Other correlates of greater screening confidence were as follows: Group 1-being offered a screening test choice and cost not influencing modality received, and Group 2-decision satisfaction and worry. Conclusions: Women with dense breasts had lower screening confidence regardless of screening modality and those undergoing MRI had higher confidence regardless of density. The importance of informing women about screening options is underscored by observed associations between screening choice, decision satisfaction, and screening confidence.

Subpopulation data can inform US health care system implementation. OBJECTIVE: To identify patient characteristics that modify effectiveness of a mailed kit intervention at increasing screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a secondary analysis of data from the Home-Based Options to Make Cervical Cancer Screening Easy (HOME) randomized clinical trial conducted from 2014 to 2018 at Kaiser Permanente Washington. Data analysis was performed from March 2018 to May 2022. Individuals aged 30 to 64 years with female sex, health plan enrollment longer than 3 years and 5 months, a current primary care clinician, and no Papanicolaou test within the prior 3 years and 5 months were identified through electronic medical records and randomized (1:1) to the control or intervention group. INTERVENTIONS: The control group received usual care Papanicolaou screening reminders and outreach. The intervention group received usual care plus an unsolicited mailed HPV self-sampling kit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Screening uptake was captured within 6 months after randomization. Baseline patient characteristics (age, race, ethnicity, travel time to clinic, income, body mass index, tobacco use, health plan enrollment duration, time since last Papanicolaou test, mammography, comorbidities, and colorectal cancer screening adherence) were extracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Of 19 734 individuals (mean [SD] age, 50.1 [9.5] years; 14 129 [71.6%] White), 9843 were randomized to the intervention group, and 9891 were randomized to the control group. Screening uptake was 26.3% (2592 of 9843 individuals) in the intervention group vs 17.4% (1719 of 9891 individuals) in the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.43-1.60). Although absolute differences in uptake by group varied little by screening history, relative effects were greater with longer vs shorter time since last Papanicolaou test (no prior Papanicolaou test: RRs, 1.85-3.25; ≥10 years: RR, 2.78; 5-10 years: RRs, 1.69-1.86; <5 years: RRs 1.29-1.37). Relative effects were greater in participants overdue (RR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.73-2.38) vs up-to-date with mammography (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.41-1.67), although absolute difference was greater in the up-to-date group. Differences by age were not significant, with RRs of 1.33 to 1.48 across 5-year age groups in participants 30 to 54, vs 1.60 (95% CI, 1.40-1.82) in participants 55 to 59 and 1.77 (95% CI, 1.56-2.01) in participants 60 to 64 years. Among those mailed kits, there were differences in kit use vs in-clinic screening by age, race, plan enrollment duration, underscreening duration, and colorectal cancer screening adherence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, clinically important improvements in screening uptake were observed for all subgroups. Differences in magnitude of intervention effect and kit use highlighted opportunities to optimize HPV self-sampling for priority groups.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) approaches facilitate risk prediction model development using high-dimensional predictors and higher-order interactions at the cost of model interpretability and transparency. We compared the relative predictive performance of statistical and ML models to guide modeling strategy selection for surveillance mammography outcomes in women with a personal history of breast cancer (PHBC). METHODS: We cross-validated seven risk prediction models for two surveillance outcomes, failure (breast cancer within 12 months of a negative surveillance mammogram) and benefit (surveillance-detected breast cancer). We included 9,447 mammograms (495 failures, 1,414 benefits, and 7,538 nonevents) from years 1996 to 2017 using a 1:4 matched case-control samples of women with PHBC in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We assessed model performance of conventional regression, regularized regressions (LASSO and elastic-net), and ML methods (random forests and gradient boosting machines) by evaluating their calibration and, among well-calibrated models, comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: LASSO and elastic-net consistently provided well-calibrated predicted risks for surveillance failure and benefit. The AUCs of LASSO and elastic-net were both 0.63 (95% CI, 0.60-0.66) for surveillance failure and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.64-0.68) for surveillance benefit, the highest among well-calibrated models. CONCLUSIONS: For predicting breast cancer surveillance mammography outcomes, regularized regression outperformed other modeling approaches and balanced the trade-off between model flexibility and interpretability. IMPACT: Regularized regression may be preferred for developing risk prediction models in other contexts with rare outcomes, similar training sample sizes, and low-dimensional features.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by mammography screening is a controversial outcome with potential benefits and harms. The association of mammography screening interval and woman's risk factors with the likelihood of DCIS detection after multiple screening rounds is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To develop a 6-year risk prediction model for screen-detected DCIS according to mammography screening interval and women's risk factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium cohort study assessed women aged 40 to 74 years undergoing mammography screening (digital mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis) from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2020, at breast imaging facilities within 6 geographically diverse registries of the consortium. Data were analyzed between February and June 2022. EXPOSURES: Screening interval (annual, biennial, or triennial), age, menopausal status, race and ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, benign breast biopsy history, breast density, body mass index, age at first birth, and false-positive mammography history. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Screen-detected DCIS defined as a DCIS diagnosis within 12 months after a positive screening mammography result, with no concurrent invasive disease. RESULTS: A total of 916 931 women (median [IQR] age at baseline, 54 [46-62] years; 12% Asian, 9% Black, 5% Hispanic/Latina, 69% White, 2% other or multiple races, and 4% missing) met the eligibility criteria, with 3757 screen-detected DCIS diagnoses. Screening round-specific risk estimates from multivariable logistic regression were well calibrated (expected-observed ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03) with a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.639 (95% CI, 0.630-0.648). Cumulative 6-year risk of screen-detected DCIS estimated from screening round-specific risk estimates, accounting for competing risks of death and invasive cancer, varied widely by all included risk factors. Cumulative 6-year screen-detected DCIS risk increased with age and shorter screening interval. Among women aged 40 to 49 years, the mean 6-year screen-detected DCIS risk was 0.30% (IQR, 0.21%-0.37%) for annual screening, 0.21% (IQR, 0.14%-0.26%) for biennial screening, and 0.17% (IQR, 0.12%-0.22%) for triennial screening. Among women aged 70 to 74 years, the mean cumulative risks were 0.58% (IQR, 0.41%-0.69%) after 6 annual screens, 0.40% (IQR, 0.28%-0.48%) for 3 biennial screens, and 0.33% (IQR, 0.23%-0.39%) after 2 triennial screens. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, 6-year screen-detected DCIS risk was higher with annual screening compared with biennial or triennial screening intervals. Estimates from the prediction model, along with risk estimates of other screening benefits and harms, could help inform policy makers' discussions of screening strategies.",

        "abstract": "Aims: To investigate the impact on localisation of utilising contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans and the formal input of a radiologist in the radiotherapy planning process. Method: Ten head and neck / brain patients had pre- and post-contrast CT scans in the treatment position. Over several months, their unenhanced and enhanced scans were re-contoured by the original oncologist, and a radiologist. These new contours were compared to the original unenhanced contours and differences in contour volume, geographical position and tolerance doses on the associated PTVs were evaluated. Results: The use of contrast lead to significant differences in the size of GTVs. Mean differences in GTVs of 32.8 % were significant at p=0.01. No significant impact on the position of the contour centre was noted. The impact of the radiologist lead to large differences in GTV (mean 20.5 %), but large SDs meant this result was not statistically significant. The contouring precision of the oncologist showed no significant difference for GTVs and PTVs. Conclusions: The use of contrast when planning the radiotherapy treatment for head and neck / brain patients was found to lead to significant differences in GTV size, a lesser effect on PTV definition and little impact on the position of the contour centre. It may have important implications for multi-phase treatments where the GTV (rather than the PTV) is targeted for boost doses. Differences due to the input of a radiologist appear to be considerable and require further investigation when additional patient numbers have been acquired to improve precision. © 2000, Cambridge University Press.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, burn camps across the United States and Canada could not hold any in-person activities. They had to either pause burn camps or quickly adapt to a virtual online platform. A 37-item electronic survey was developed and emailed to burn camp directors in the United States and Canada to determine what adaptations were necessary during the pandemic. This survey allowed directors to provide details on many facets such as camp format, successes observed, and challenges encountered. Twenty-one of 34 (62%) burn camp organizations completed the survey. Thirteen of the 21 (62%) respondents held virtual burn camps in 2020 while everyone else canceled their camps in 2020. The mean number of camps offered per organization decreased from 6.3 in 2019 to 4.7 in 2020. The average number of burn survivors and family members participating also dropped in that same period (2019 aggregate mean = 229.2 vs 2020 aggregate mean = 151.4). Components of virtual camp included video conferencing platforms, \"camp-in-a-box\" activities, and some prerecorded sessions. Most camp directors believed that their campers were satisfied with the virtual format. Factors allowing for a successful virtual camp included an effective online platform, scheduling adequate duration of programs, and appropriate staffing levels. Most common barriers to an effective virtual camp were participant engagement, special needs/accessibility concerns, and staff effectiveness in this format. While challenging, burn camps can be held in a virtual format successfully with proper planning, staff training, and support of campers and their families.",

While split-thickness skin grafts close the wound, they leave patients with visible scars, dry skin, pruritis, pain, pigmentation alterations, and changes in sensation. The optimal replacement for full-thickness skin loss is replacement with intact full-thickness skin. New technologies combined with advances in the understanding of the mechanisms behind wound healing have led to the development of techniques and products that may eventually recapitulate the functions, appearance, and physical properties of normal skin. Autologous homologous skin constructs, minimal functional skin units, and composite bioengineered skin with dermal substitutes all represent potential avenues for full-thickness composite skin development and application in extensive wounds. This article summarizes the progress, state, and future of full-thickness skin regeneration in burn and massive wound patients.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Literature examining the connection between obesity and burn injuries is limited. This study is a secondary analysis of a multicenter trial data set to investigate the association between burn outcomes and obesity following severe burn injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Body mass index (BMI) was used to stratify patients as normal weight (NW; BMI 18.5-25), all obese (AO; any BMI>30), obese I (OI; BMI 30-34.9), obese II (OII; BMI 35-39.9), or obese III (OIII; BMI>40). The primary outcome examined was mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), number of transfusions, injury scores, infection occurrences, number of operations, ventilator days, intensive care unit LOS, and days to wound healing. RESULTS: Of 335 patients included for study, 130 were obese. Median total body surface area (TBSA) was 31%, 77 patients (23%) had inhalation injury and 41 patients died. Inhalation injury was higher in OIII than NW (42.1% versus 20%, P = 0.03). Blood stream infections (BSI) were higher in OI versus NW (0.72 versus 0.33, P = 0.03). Total operations, ventilator days, days to wound healing, multiorgan dysfunction score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluationscore, hospital LOS, and intensive care unit LOS were not significantly affected by BMI classification. Mortality was not significantly different between obesity groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves did not significantly differ between the groups (χ2 = 0.025, P = 0.87). Multiple logistic regression identified age, TBSA, and full thickness burn as significant independent predictors (P < 0.05) of mortality; however, BMI classification itself was not predictive of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: No significant association between obesity and mortality was seen after burn injury. Age, TBSA, and percent full- thickness burn were independent predictors of mortality after burn injury, while BMI classification was not.",

The purpose of this article is to describe new impactful concepts in burn first aid, triage, resuscitation, and treatment as well as their impact on future research. RECENT FINDINGS: First aid after burn injury traditionally consists of extinguishing the burn and applying dressings. Recent evidence suggests that applying 20 min of cool tap water to the burn wound in the first 3 h postburn mitigates burn injury extent. National burn center transfer criteria have been updated, impacting patient initial transfer and management. The adverse effects of hydroxocobalamin, a commonly used antidote for cyanide toxicity, have been delineated. Initial burn resuscitation recommendations for both volume and potentially fluid type are being reexamined. The emergence of innovative skin substitutes may improve burn survival by providing a physiologically stabilizing intermediate dressing. Finally, formal clinical practice guidelines for early mobility in the ICU after burn injury have been defined. SUMMARY: These changes in burn care, triage, resuscitation, and treatment have challenged traditional burn care standards, created new standards, and are the basis for future prospective randomized trials.",

        "abstract": "A rare plant species of the Orchidaceae family, Dendrobium officinale is considered among the top ten Chinese medicinal herbs for its polysaccharide. Since 2021, when the dieback disease of D. officinale was first reported in Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province, China, Fusarium isolates (number = 152) were obtained from 70 plants in commercial greenhouses. The disease incidence ranged from 40% to 60% in the surveyed areas. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) coupled with morphological characterization revealed that the collected isolates belonged to five species (sp.), viz., Fusarium concentricum, F. fujikuroi, F. nirenbergiae, F. curvatum, and F. stilboides, with isolation frequencies of 34.6%, 22.3%, 18.4%, 13.8%, and 10.5%, respectively. Notably, at least two Fusarium species were simultaneously isolated and identified from the infected plants. Finally, the pathogenicity test results demonstrated that such species were responsible for the dieback disease of D. officinale. However, F. concentricum and F. fujikuroi were more invasive compared to the other species in this study. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study was the first report of F. concentricum, F. curvatum, F. fujikuroi, F. nirenbergiae, and F. stilboides causing the dieback disease of D. officinale in China and worldwide. This work provides valuable data about the diversity and pathogenicity of Fusarium populations, which will help in formulating effective strategies and policies for better control of the dieback disease.",

        "abstract": "Aflatoxins are carcinogens mainly produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus in susceptible crops, including pistachio. The primary inoculum sources of these pathogens are plant debris in the orchard soils. In Californian fields, one approach to controlling aflatoxin contamination is based on releasing the atoxigenic strain of A. flavus AF36 in inoculated (coated) sorghum grains (AF36 Prevail). However, this control method can fail due to poor sporulation of the AF36 strain or sorghum grain losses due to predation. In 2008 and 2018, we showed that toxigenic and atoxigenic isolates of Aspergillus spp. frequently colonized fallen inflorescences of male pistachio trees. Under controlled conditions, strain AF36 profusely colonized pistachio male inflorescences when humidity was higher than 90%. However, there were significant differences between types of inflorescence (aerial > fallen). In 2016, we considerably (P = 0.015) increased the population of AF36 on the canopies of trees when fallen inflorescences were inoculated with AF36, compared with untreated trees. In 2017 and 2018, these differences were not detected (P > 0.05) due to cross-contamination of strain AF36 between seasons and neighboring plots. In any case, the density of AF36 spores on the canopy of the inflorescence-treated trees was similar (P > 0.05) to that on trees treated with the commercial product. Here, we present a new method for applying strain AF36 based on using a natural, abundant, and uniformly distributed substrate in pistachio fields, and we discuss how it can be improved. Furthermore, our results indicate that, in pistachio orchards where biocontrol practices are not conducted, eliminating this important source of toxigenic Aspergillus inoculum is recommended.",

        "abstract": "Wet cooling towers are used in industrial processes, power plants, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Their purpose is to reject waste heat from a system through evaporative cooling of process water. Due to their design, a small fraction of process water is emitted from the tower exit, termed “spray drift.” Dissolved solids contained within spray drift droplets are regulated as PM10 emissions by EPA AP-42. Here, we use a novel instrumentation package to measure particulate emissions from drift droplets at two cooling towers located at separate power plants. We find that drift droplet properties depend on the sampling position over the tower so multiple positions need to be sampled to accurately estimate emissions. We estimate 11 and 3.3 grams of PM10 are emitted from each tower per hour, with 78% and 87% of PM10 emissions also qualifying as PM2.5. AP-42 overestimates PM10 emissions by a factor of 2.4 for one tower and nearly 300 for the other. These results suggest that AP-42 may require revision to both accurately reflect lower PM10 emissions and account for unregulated PM2.5, which constitute the majority of emissions.

        "abstract": "Spatial and temporal variations in aerosol particulate matter (PM) were investigated for distribution over thefour seasons of chemical constituents and particle size fractions in Faisalabad, Pakistan from June 2012 toApril 2013. At nine sampling sites, four PM mass size fractions (total suspended particulates [TSP], PM10,PM4 and PM2.5) were monitored; simultaneously, TSP mass samples were collected on glass fiber filtersusing a high volume air sampler. TSP samples (144) were subjected to quantitative chemical analyses fordetermining trace elements (Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn, Cu, Fe) using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and water-solublecations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, NH4+) and anions (Cl–, SO42– and NO3–) by ion chromatography. The highestPM mass concentrations were observed at industrial sites, while they were somewhat lower in major roadintersections and lowest in the remote background site. It was also observed that PM mass concentrationswere about two to 20 times higher than the standard limits of the World Health Organization and the USEnvironmental Protection Agency. Coarse particles (TSP, PM10 and PM4) were found to be highest duringthe summer, while relatively fine particles (PM2.5) were higher during the winter period. Concentrations ofall size fractions were lowest during the monsoon sampling period at all sites. Concentrations of differentelements and water-soluble ions also followed the similar temporal pattern as PM mass concentrations. Thecrustal elements Ca, Fe, Mg and Na were the largest contributors to TSP mass while elements of anthropogenicorigin (Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu and Zn) had relatively lower concentrations and also showed a high spatialvariation. Among the anions, sulfate (SO42–) was the predominant species contributing to 50-60% of the totalanion concentration. It was found that rainfall, wind speed and relative humidity were the most importantmeteorological factors affecting PM concentrations. The evaluation of data presented in this paper will serveas a basis for future regional modeling and source apportionment.",

Ice cream with varying fat levels was used as the vehicle for the flavor compounds in the experiment. Chemical and sensory flavor profiles were obtained by modified dynamic headspace analysis and descriptive analysis, respectively. Chromatographic peak areas of flavor-volatiles were used as the variables for the chemical data set. Initially, principal component analysis and canonical variate analysis were performed separately on the chemical and sensory data sets to explore the structure of each set. Flavor volatiles were then further studied to investigate their impact on the sensory profile of ice cream using general procrustes analysis and partial least squares regression analysis. The results from the two statistical analysis methods are compared and discussed. Additionally, the effect of log-transformation of chemical data on the overall chemical-sensory relationship was evaluated within each statistical method. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The objective of this study was to find textural differences in these cheeses by sensory and instrumental methods and to try to correlate the sensory and the instrumental data. Nine commercial cheeses were evaluated for aroma, flavor, and texture by descriptive analysis and were also subjected to instrumental texture profile analysis. The sensory evaluation by a panel of nine judges separated the cheeses into 'smoked' and 'non-smoked' based on aroma and flavor. On the basis of texture the judges categorized the cheeses into either 'dry and crumbly' or 'sticky and creamy'. The texture profile analysis segregated the cheeses into 'smoked' and 'non-smoked'. 'Hardness' (instrumental) was positively correlated to sensory texture attributes such as 'dry', 'hardness' and 'crumbly', which might indicate hardness of cheeses during mastication. The judges that participated in the panel were found to be very consistent as a group in their evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In dogs with non-resectable hepatic neoplasia, treatment options are limited. The objectives of this study were to describe the use of a novel drug-eluting embolic microsphere containing paclitaxel for use during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), to compare results of liver-specific owner questionnaires and tumor volume pre- and post-TACE, and to measure systemic paclitaxel concentration post-TACE. Client-owned dogs with non-resectable hepatic neoplasia were prospectively enrolled. All owners completed questionnaires validated for the assessment of subjective outcomes in dogs with cancer before the TACE procedure and approximately 4 weeks after the TACE procedure. A CT scan was performed before TACE and 1 month after TACE; results were compared. Blood samples were obtained at specified time points post-TACE to determine systemic paclitaxel concentrations. Seven dogs (median weight: 8.9 kg; range, 4.3-31 kg) were enrolled. TACE was successfully performed in all dogs, and no intra-procedural complications were encountered. Questionnaire scores improved significantly post-TACE. Among the 6 dogs for which full data were available, median pre-TACE tumor volume was 390 cc (range 152-1,484; interquartile range 231-1,139) and median post-TACE tumor volume was 203 cc (range 98-889; interquartile range 151-369), which was significantly (P = .028) lower. All 6 dogs had a reduction in volume at the post-TACE measurement. Mean percent change in tumor volume was -45.6% (95%CI -58.6 to -32.6%). The mean plasma paclitaxel concentration in canine blood peaked at 4 days post-TACE procedure and was 25.7 ng/mL (range = 3.09-110 ng/mL) Median survival time was 629 days (95%CI 18 to upper limit not reached). The use of a novel paclitaxel-eluting microsphere in this cohort of dogs successfully decreased tumor volume significantly after TACE and improved clinical signs. Future investigation into the use of TACE and other similar therapies is warranted due to the promising outcomes noted in this cohort.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Placement of a subcutaneous ureteral bypass (SUB) device is an effective method to relieve all causes of ureteral obstruction in cats. Complications involving migration within the gastrointestinal tract have been seldomly described. OBJECTIVES: To characterize transmural migration of SUB devices within the digestive tract in cats. ANIMALS: Eleven migrated SUB catheters identified in 8 cats between 2017 and 2021. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of cats with a SUB device in which migration into the gastrointestinal tract was identified. RESULTS: The median time from SUB device placement to implant migration was 928 days (201-2298 days). Seven cats had obstruction of the SUB device and a positive urine culture at diagnosis. The migration was identified by ultrasound in 6/11, pre-operative contrast radiography in 2/2, and only at time of surgery in 3 SUB devices. All cats underwent surgical correction. Four nephrostomy and 7 cystotomy catheters migrated. Migration occurred into the duodenum (3/11), jejunum (7/11), and colon (1/11). SUB devices were removed in 7 cats and replaced in 2 cats, with 1 cat diagnosed with 2 migration events. Gastrointestinal resection and anastomosis were performed in 7/8 cats and an enterotomy in 2 cats. Six cats survived to discharge. The median follow-up time after migration diagnosis was 365 days (range, 0-1114 days) and 2 cats are still alive. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Although a rare complication, migration of SUB device should be considered in cats with SUB device obstruction and a positive urine culture.",

ANIMALS: 20 small- and toy-breed dogs with an IHPSS. PROCEDURES: All dogs underwent CT angiography for shunt evaluation as well as PTCE. Medical records were reviewed for pertinent data, and owners and primary veterinarians were contacted for long-term follow-up information. RESULTS: Dogs ranged from 1.5 to 10.0 kg (mean ± SD, 6.32 ± 2.57 kg) in weight. The equipment used to perform PTCE tended to be smaller than that previously described for larger breed dogs. Intra- and postoperative complication rates were 20% (4/20) and 5% (1/20), respectively, and included hypotension, bradycardia, hypercapnia, ventricular premature contractions, hypothermia, and regurgitation. Dogs were discharged a median of 3 days (range, 1 to 3 days) after surgery, and all dogs survived to discharge. Clinical signs resolved in 95% (19/20) of the dogs a median of 21 days after the procedure. One- and 2-year survival rates were 92%. Three dogs had died by the time of data collection; 2 of these dogs died of causes related to the IHPSS 267 and 1,178 days, respectively, after the procedure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Percutaneous transvenous coil embolization was a safe and effective option for treatment of IHPSS in small- and toy-breed dogs and offered a minimally invasive alternative to open surgical techniques. Complication and survival rates in this cohort were similar to or better than those reported in previous studies evaluating PTCE and open surgical techniques for treatment of IHPSS in dogs.",

        "issued": "2022",
        "abstract": "The microbiome has clearly been established as a cutting-edge field in tumor immunology and immunotherapy. Growing evidence supports the role of the microbiome in immune surveillance, self-tolerance, and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockade (1-6). Moreover, recent studies including those using fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) have demonstrated that response to checkpoint immunotherapies may be conferred or eliminated through gut microbiome modulation (7, 8). Consequently, studies evaluating microbiota-host immune and metabolic interactions remain an area of high impact research. While observations in murine models have highlighted the importance of the microbiome in response to therapy, we lack sufficient understanding of the exact mechanisms underlying these interactions. Furthermore, mouse and human gut microbiome composition may be too dissimilar for discovery of all relevant gut microbial biomarkers. Multiple cancers in dogs, including lymphoma, high grade gliomas, melanomas and osteosarcoma (OSA) closely resemble their human analogues, particularly in regard to metastasis, disease recurrence and response to treatment. Importantly, dogs with these spontaneous cancers also have intact immune systems, suggesting that microbiome analyses in these subjects may provide high yield information, especially in the setting of novel immunotherapy regimens which are currently expanding rapidly in canine comparative oncology (9, 10). Additionally, as onco-microbiotic therapies are developed to modify gut microbiomes for maximal responsiveness, large animal models with intact immune systems will be useful for trialing interventions and monitoring adverse events. Together, pre-clinical mechanistic studies and large animal trials can help fully unlock the potential of the microbiome as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancer.",

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent neoplasia identified in dogs and considerable effort has been committed towards identifying definitive and palliative treatment options. HCC is well recognized in humans as a sequelae of liver disease such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, while in dogs a similar link has failed to be fully elucidated. Management of HCC in people may be curative or palliative dependent on staging and transplant eligibility. Despite differences in etiology, there is substantial similarity between treatment options for liver neoplasia in human and veterinary medicine. The below summary provides a comparative discussion regarding hepatic neoplasia in dogs and people with a specific focus on HCC.

METHODS: Using RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Methods, a modified Delphi approach identified consensus statements to guide LPR treatment. Experts independently and blindly scored proposed statements on importance, scientific acceptability, usability, and feasibility in a four-round iterative process. Accepted measures reached scores with ≥ 80% agreement in the 7-9 range (on a 9-point Likert scale) across all four categories. RESULTS: Fifteen experts rated 36 proposed initial statements. In round one, 10 (27.8%) statements were rated as valid. In round two, 8 statements were modified based on panel suggestions, and experts subsequently rated 5 of these statements as valid. Round three's discussion refined statements not yet accepted, and in round four, additional voting identified 2 additional statements as valid. In total, 17 (47.2%) best practice statements reached consensus, touching on topics as varied as role of empiric treatment, medication use, lifestyle modifications, and indications for laryngoscopy. CONCLUSION: Using a well-tested methodology, best practice statements in the treatment of LPR were identified. The statements serve to guide physicians on LPR treatment considerations.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe demographics and imaging and compare findings and symptoms at presentation in a large cohort of persons with cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (CPMD) with and without hypopharyngeal diverticula. METHODOLOGY: Prospective, multicenter cohort study of all individuals enrolled in the Prospective OUtcomes of Cricopharyngeal Hypertonicity (POUCH) Collaborative. Patient survey, comorbidities, radiography, laryngoscopy findings, and patient-reported outcome measures (e.g., Eating Assessment Tool [EAT-10]) data were abstracted from a REDCap database and summarized using means, medians, percentages, and frequencies. Diagnostic categories were compared using analysis of variance. RESULTS: A total of 250 persons were included. The mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of the cohort was 69.0 (11.2). Forty-two percent identified as female. Zenker diverticula (ZD) was diagnosed in 85.2%, 9.2% with CPMD without diverticula, 4.4% with a Killian Jamieson diverticula (KJD), and 1.2% traction-type diverticula. There were no differences between diagnostic categories in regard to age, gender, and duration of symptoms (p = 0.25, 0.19, 0.45). The mean (SD) EAT-10 score for each group was 17.1 (10.1) for ZD, 20.2 (9.3) for CPMD, and 10.3 (9.4) for KJD. Patients with isolated CPMD had significantly greater EAT-10 scores compared to the other diagnostic groups (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: ZD is the most common, followed by CPMD without diverticula, KJD, and traction-type. Patients with isolated obstructing CPMD may be more symptomatic than persons with ZD or KJD.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Disordered swallowing, or dysphagia, is the most common complication after anterior cervical spine (ACS) surgery. Many operative factors are associated with development of dysphagia. The aim of this study was to explore how number of levels instrumented, specific levels fused, and plate morphology affect chronic dysphagia after ACS surgery. METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to a tertiary center for otolaryngology evaluation for chronic dysphagia after ACS surgery between 2012 and 2017 were enrolled. Basic demographic data were obtained. Plain radiographs were reviewed for number of levels fused, upper instrumented vertebrae, and plate morphology. Plate morphology was categorized as a closed, small window, large window, or no profile plate. The 10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) was used to assess dysphagia severity. RESULTS: Of 171 patients referred for dysphagia, 126 met inclusion criteria; 54% were female, with a mean age of 63 years (range, 32-88 years). Mean EAT-10 score was 18.5 ± 10.1. Mean time from spine surgery to videofluoroscopic swallow study for dysphagia was 58.3 months. Mean number of levels fused was 2.2 ± 0.9. There were no significant differences in EAT-10 scores in single-level versus multilevel fusion (19.0 vs. 18.4, P = 0.76) as well as with regard to upper instrumented vertebrae or plate morphology. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients with chronic dysphagia following ACS surgery, the severity of dysphagia as measured by the EAT-10 was not affected by upper instrumented vertebrae, number of levels fused, or plate morphology.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess barium esophagram (BAS) as a diagnostic marker for patients with Killian Jamieson diverticula (KJD). METHODS: Prospective, multicenter cohort study of individuals enrolled in the Prospective OUtcomes of Cricopharyngeus Hypertonicity (POUCH) Collaborative. Patient demographics, comorbidities, radiographic imaging reports, laryngoscopy findings, patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), and operative reporting were abstracted from a REDCap database and summarized using means, medians, percentages, frequencies. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were used to test pre- to post-operative differences in RSI, EAT-10, and VHI-10 scores. Diagnostic test evaluation including sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value with 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing BAS findings to operative report. RESULTS: A total of 287 persons were enrolled; 13 (4%) patients were identified with confirmed KJD on operative reports. 100% underwent open transcervical excision. BAS has a 46.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.2, 70.9) sensitivity and 97.8% (95% CI: 95.3, 99.0) specificity in detecting a KJD and 50% (95% CI: 25.4, 74.6) positive predictive value but 97.4% (95%CI: 94.8, 98.7) negative predictive value. Preoperatively, patients reported mean (SD) RSI and EAT-10 of 19.4 (9) and 8.3 (7.5) accordingly. Postoperatively, patients reported mean (SD) RSI and EAT-10 as 5.4 (6.2) and 2.3 (3.3). Both changes in RSI and EAT-10 were statistically significant (p = 0.008, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: KJD are rare and represent <5% of hypopharyngeal diverticula undergoing surgical intervention. Open transcervical surgery significantly improves symptoms of dysphagia. BAS has high specificity but low sensitivity in detecting KJD. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 133:2110-2115, 2023.",

This review seeks to describe in detail state-of-the-art practice in advanced deglutology practice. Recent Findings: Much of dysphagia evaluation and management can currently be practiced in the otolaryngology office, from swallowing function assessment with endoscopic and fluoroscopic techniques, to dysphagia interventions such as dilation of the pharyngoesophageal segment under local anesthesia. Summary: Advanced dysphagia evaluation and management can be performed in the outpatient otolaryngology clinic. However, given the specialized nature of these diagnostic and procedural interventions, laryngology fellowship training with a focus on deglutology and collaboration with a dysphagia speech pathologist will likely become a pre-requisite for the otolaryngologist to run a comprehensive dysphagia clinic.",

The temperature dependence of the high-frequency shear modulus G∞(T) at T > Tg is found to be consistent with the predictions of the elastic models of viscous flow that consider the energy barrier to the structural rearrangement associated with an elementary flow event to be governed by G∞(T). A strong correlation between the fragility indices of these liquids and |[Formula presented]| at T > Tg indicates a clear connection between their entropic and elastic properties. Finally, the rise in the Poisson's ratio of these liquids with temperature is argued to be a consequence of the composition dependence of [Formula presented], as the temperature derivative of their bulk modulus is an order of magnitude lower than [Formula presented] at T > Tg.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental and much-debated issue in glass science is the existence and nature of liquid-liquid transitions in glass-forming liquids. Here, we report the existence of a novel reentrant structural transition in a S-rich arsenic sulfide liquid of composition As2.5S97.5. The nature of this transition and its effect on viscosity are investigated in situ using a combination of differential scanning calorimetry and simultaneous Raman spectroscopic and rheometric measurements. The results indicate that, upon heating significantly above its glass transition temperature (261 K), the constituent Sn sulfur chains in the structure of the supercooled liquid first undergo a Sn⇌S8 chain-to-ring conversion near ∼383 K, which is exothermic in nature. Further heating above 393 K alters the equilibrium to shift in the opposite direction toward an endothermic ring-to-chain conversion characteristic of the well-known λ-transition in pure sulfur liquid. This behavior is attributed to the competing effects of enthalpy of mixing and conformational entropy of ring and chain elements in the liquid. The existence of reentrant structural transitions in glass-forming liquids could provide important insights into the thermodynamics of liquid-liquid transitions and may have important consequences for harnessing novel functionalities of derived glasses.",

While Tg and fragility index of single-alkali liquids are controlled by the segmental motion of phosphate chains, the mixed-alkali liquids exhibit the presence of a second relaxation process, which is slower than chain motion and is characterized by a lower activation energy. This process is assigned to the scission and renewal of P-O bonds that relieve the accumulated stress in the network resulting from its matrix-mediated coupling with pairwise hopping of dissimilar alkalis. The viscous flow and glass transition in mixed-alkali phosphate liquids appear to be controlled by this P-O bond scission-renewal process, which is shown to be consistent with a lowering of their fragility index and a concomitant decrease in the stretching exponent of structural relaxation, compared to their single-alkali counterparts.",

The compositional variations in the viscosity and fragility of these liquids are shown to be consistent with the corresponding structural evolution. While the shear relaxation of AsxSe100-x liquids with 40 ≤ x ≤ 50 is associated with the dynamics of As–Se bond scission/renewal, the As-rich liquids with x ≥ 55 are found to display an additional low-frequency process, which is related to a cooperative interconversion between molecular and network structural moieties. A similar behavior is also exhibited by the As-rich liquids in the PxAs4–xSe3 series. In contrast, the P-rich liquids characterized by high molecule content display a power-law relaxation behavior resulting from a rather broad distribution of relaxation timescales associated with various dynamical modes of single molecules and molecular clusters.",

Here, we report a universal wet-chemistry method, by which the super-sized supramolecular MIOC glasses can be synthesized from non-meltable MOFs. Alcohol and acid were used as agents to inhibit crystallization. The MIOC glasses demonstrate unique features including high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic network. Directional photoluminescence with a large polarization ratio (≈47 %) was observed from samples doped with organic dyes. This crystallization-suppressing approach enables fabrication of super-sized MCC glasses, which cannot be achieved by conventional vitrification methods, and thus allows for exploring new MCC glasses possessing photonic functionalities.",

        "abstract": "As acoustic communication systems become increasingly common in our daily life, eavesdropping brings severe security and privacy risks. Current methods of acoustic eavesdropping either provide low resolution due to the use of sub-6 GHz frequencies, work only for limited words based on classification approaches, or cannot work through-wall because of the use of optical sensors. In this article, we present milliEar, a mmWave acoustic eavesdropping system that leverages the high-resolution of mmWave FMCW ranging and generative machine learning models to not only extract vibrations but to reconstruct the audio. milliEar combines speaker vibration estimation with conditional generative adversarial networks to eavesdrop and recover high-quality audios (i.e., with no vocabulary constraints). We implement and evaluate milliEar using off-the-shelf mmWave radars deployed in different scenarios and settings. Evaluation results clearly show that milliEar can accurately reconstruct the audio even at different distances, angles, and through the wall with different insulator materials. In addition, our subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that the reconstructed audio has a strong similarity with the original audio.",

        "issued": "2024-02-01",
        "abstract": "Most IoT systems involve IoT devices, communication protocols, remote cloud, IoT applications, mobile apps, and the physical environment. However, existing IoT security analyses only focus on a subset of all the essential components, such as device firmware or communication protocols, and ignore IoT systems' interactive nature, resulting in limited attack detection capabilities. In this work, we propose Iota, a logic programming-based framework to perform system-level security analysis for IoT systems. Iota generates attack graphs for IoT systems, showing all of the system resources that can be compromised and enumerating potential attack traces. In building Iota, we design novel techniques to scan IoT systems for individual vulnerabilities and further create generic exploit models for IoT vulnerabilities. We also identify and model physical dependencies between different devices as they are unique to IoT systems and are employed by adversaries to launch complicated attacks. In addition, we utilize NLP techniques to extract IoT app semantics based on app descriptions. Iota automatically translates vulnerabilities, exploits, and device dependencies to Prolog clauses and invokes MulVAL to construct attack graphs. To evaluate vulnerabilities' system-wide impact, we propose three metrics based on the attack graph, which provide guidance on hardening IoT systems. Evaluation on 127 IoT CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) shows that Iota's exploit modeling module achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting vulnerabilities' preconditions and effects. We apply Iota to 37 synthetic smart home IoT systems based on real-world IoT apps and devices. Experimental results show that our framework is effective and highly efficient. Among 27 shortest attack traces revealed by the attack graphs, 62.8% are not anticipated by the system administrator. It only takes 1.2 seconds to generate and analyze the attack graph for an IoT system consisting of 50 devices.",

The current practice of manually selecting FL hyper-parameters puts a high burden on FL practitioners since various applications have different training preferences. In this paper, we propose FedTune, an automatic hyper-parameter tuning algorithm tailored to applications' diverse system requirements in FL training. FedTune is lightweight and flexible, achieving 8.48%-26.75% improvement for different datasets compared to using fixed FL hyper-parameters.",

        "abstract": "Acoustic signal analysis has been employed in various medical devices. However, studies involving cough sound analysis to screen the potential pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) suspects are very few. The main objective of this cross-sectional validation study was to develop and validate the Swaasa AI platform to screen and prioritize at risk patients for PTB based on the signature cough sound as well as symptomatic information provided by the subjects. The voluntary cough sound data was collected at Andhra Medical College-India. An Algorithm based on multimodal convolutional neural network architecture and feedforward artificial neural network (tabular features) was built and validated on a total of 567 subjects, comprising 278 positive and 289 negative PTB cases. The output from these two models was combined to detect the likely presence (positive cases) of PTB. In the clinical validation phase, the AI-model was found to be 86.82% accurate in detecting the likely presence of PTB with 90.36% sensitivity and 84.67% specificity. The pilot testing of model was conducted at a peripheral health care centre, RHC Simhachalam-India on 65 presumptive PTB cases. Out of which, 15 subjects truly turned out to be PTB positive with a positive predictive value of 75%. The validation results obtained from the model are quite encouraging. This platform has the potential to fulfil the unmet need of a cost-effective PTB screening method. It works remotely, presents instantaneous results, and does not require a highly trained operator. Therefore, it could be implemented in various inaccessible, resource-poor parts of the world.",

        "abstract": "Gun violence in many U.S. cities increased dramatically after the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surges in criminal access to untraceable privately manufactured firearms and new guns purchased from licensed dealers have been suggested as risk factors associated with the pandemic increase in gun violence. Official data on 4593 guns recovered in Oakland, California between 2017 and 2021 that were submitted to ATF for subsequent tracing are analyzed to determine whether the sources of crime guns changed and whether privately manufactured firearms and fast time-to-crime traced guns were more likely to be used in violent crime during this time period. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the characteristics of firearms recovered during the study period and the results of ATF tracing. Logistic regression models are then used to assess systematic differences between firearms recovered during the pre-pandemic years as compared to firearms recovered during the pandemic years, and determine whether certain firearms are more likely to be recovered in violent crime. These analyses estimated large increases during the pandemic in the odds that recovered firearms were privately manufactured and recently purchased. Recovered privately manufactured firearms were also more likely to be associated with violent crimes. These findings support recent efforts to regulate privately manufactured firearms and continued efforts to reduce the illegal diversion of firearms from lawful commerce.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To examine the firearm acquisition histories of mass and active shooters from California. Methods: First, we identified 22 individuals with a record of authorized handgun purchase in California who perpetrated an attack between 1996 and 2018. Using incidence density sampling, mass and active shooters were matched to purchasers and compared using conditional logistic regressions. Second, we characterized the firearm transaction patterns of 55 mass and active shooters who perpetrated attacks between 1985 and 2018 and implemented a mixed model to identify factors associated with firearms acquired in close temporal proximity to the attack. Results: Compared to legal handgun purchasers, shooters had more purchases of handguns in the year prior to the attack (OR = 5.58, 95% CI: 2.34, 13.33), greater odds of a history of purchase denials (OR = 23.43, 95% CI: 4.55, 120.59), and fewer years between the last recorded purchase and the end date (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.90). Among the broader set of mass and active shooters, mixed model results indicated that the firearms acquired close to the attack were more likely to be long guns, discharged during the attack, purchased out-of-state, and acquired by methods other than through a licensed dealer. Conclusions: Findings are suggestive of pre-attack planning.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the increasing traffic demand in radio access networks (RAN) has led to considerable growth of the number of base stations (BS), posing a serious scalability issue with respect to the energy consumption of BSS. Optical-access-enabled Cloud RAN (CRAN) has been recently proposed as a next-generation access network, where the digital unit (DU) of a conventional cell site is separated from the radio unit (RU), by an optical access network (fronthaul), and moved to the 'cloud' (DU pool) for centralized signal processing and management. Time-Wavelength Division Multiplexing (TWDM) Passive Optical Network (PON) is a promising fronthaul solution due to its low energy consumption and high capacity. In this study, we propose the concept of Virtual Base Station (VBS), which is dynamically formed for each cell by assigning virtualized network resources, including i) a virtualized PON link connecting the DU and RU and ii) virtualized functional entities performing baseband processing in DU pool. We propose a novel energy-saving scheme exploiting VBS formation for CRAN and compare its performance with the optimal results of an Integer Linear Program for VBS formation optimization problem. Numerical evaluation shows that CRAN with VBS formation achieves significant energy savings compared to traditional RAN and CRAN without VBS formation.",

        "abstract": "Today's cloud system are composed of geographically distributed datacenter interconnected by high-speed optical networks. Disaster failures can severely affect both the communication network as well as datacenters infrastructure and prevent users from accessing cloud services. After large-scale disasters, recovery efforts on both network and datacenters may take days, and, in some cases, weeks or months. Traditionally, the repair of the communication network has been treated as a separate problem from the repair of datacenters. While past research has mostly focused on network recovery, how to efficiently recover a cloud system jointly considering the limited computing and networking resources has been an important and open research problem. In this work, we investigate the problem of progressive datacenter recovery after a large-scale disaster failure, given that a network-recovery plan is made. An efficient recovery plan is explored to determine which datacenters should be recovered at each recovery stage to maximize cumulative content reachability from any source considering limited available network resources. We devise an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation to model the associated optimization problem. Our numerical examples using the ILP show that an efficient progressive datacenter-recovery plan can significantly help to increase reachability of contents during the network recovery phase. We succeeded in increasing the number of important contents in the early stages of recovery compared to a random-recovery strategy with a slight increase in resource consumption.",

About 147 DMD patients (6-34 years.) were analyzed with a focus on β1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) genotype variants. Patients were grouped by ADRB1 genotype resulting in Gly389 patients and Arg389 patients. A generalized additive mixed effects model was used to examine differences in the nonlinear trend of LVEF across patient ages between genotype groups and for ß-blocker use. Both genotype groups displayed a progressive decline in LVEF starting around the mean age of ambulation loss (~12 years). However, there was no difference between genotype groups in the progression of decline in LVEF. There was a significant effect of ß-blocker use on longitudinal LVEF, wherein patients on ß-blockers had systematically lower LVEF when compared to patients not on ß-blockers. However, the effect of ß-blocker therapy on LVEF was not affected by ADRB1 genotype. The current study did not demonstrate an influence of patient ADRB1 genotype on longitudinal LVEF in our cohort. Despite previous literature suggesting a positive influence of ß-blocker use on cardiac function in DMD patients and of an ADRB1 genotypic difference in responsiveness to ß-blocker use, we did not observe this in our cohort. Interestingly, our cohort did not demonstrate a positive influence of ß-blocker use on LVEF measures.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Corticosteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely prescribed but long-term use shows adverse effects that detract from patient quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To determine if vamorolone, a structurally unique dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is able to retain efficacy while reducing safety concerns with use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo- and prednisone-controlled 24-week clinical trial, conducted from June 29, 2018, to February 24, 2021, with 24 weeks of follow-up. This was a multicenter study (33 referral centers in 11 countries) and included boys 4 to younger than 7 years of age with genetically confirmed DMD not previously treated with corticosteroids. INTERVENTIONS: The study included 4 groups: placebo; prednisone, 0.75 mg/kg per day; vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day; and vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Study outcomes monitored (1) efficacy, which included motor outcomes (primary: time to stand from supine velocity in the vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, group vs placebo; secondary: time to stand from supine velocity [vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day], 6-minute walk distance, time to run/walk 10 m [vamorolone, 2 and 6 mg/kg per day]; exploratory: NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment, time to climb 4 stairs) and (2) safety, which included growth, bone biomarkers, and a corticotropin (ACTH)-challenge test. RESULTS: Among the 133 boys with DMD enrolled in the study (mean [SD] age, 5.4 [0.9] years), 121 were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and 114 completed the 24-week treatment period. The trial met the primary end point for change from baseline to week 24 time to stand velocity for vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day (least-squares mean [SE] velocity, 0.05 [0.01] m/s vs placebo -0.01 [0.01] m/s; 95% CI, 0.02-0.10; P = .002) and the first 4 sequential secondary end points: time to stand velocity, vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; 6-minute walk test, vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; 6-minute walk test, vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; and time to run/walk 10 m velocity, vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo. Height percentile declined in prednisone-treated (not vamorolone-treated) participants (change from baseline [SD]: prednisone, -1.88 [8.81] percentile vs vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, +3.86 [6.16] percentile; P = .02). Bone turnover markers declined with prednisone but not with vamorolone. Boys with DMD at baseline showed low ACTH-stimulated cortisol and high incidence of adrenal insufficiency. All 3 treatment groups led to increased adrenal insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this pivotal randomized clinical trial, vamorolone was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of boys with DMD over a 24-week treatment period. Vamorolone may be a safer alternative than prednisone in this disease, in which long-term corticosteroid use is the standard of care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03439670.",

OBJECTIVE: Characterize and compare disease progression by steroid treatment (prednisone, deflazacort, or no steroids) among non-ambulatory boys with DMD. METHODS: Disease progression was measured by functional status (Performance of Upper Limb Module for DMD 1.2 [PUL] and Egen Klassifikation Scale Version 2 [EK] scale) and by cardiac and pulmonary function (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], forced vital capacity [FVC] % -predicted, cough peak flow [CPF]). Longitudinal changes in outcomes, progression to key disease milestones, and dosing and body composition metrics were analyzed descriptively and in multivariate models. RESULTS: This longitudinal cohort study included 86 non-ambulatory patients with DMD (mean age 13.4 years; n = 40 [deflazacort], n = 29 [prednisone], n = 17 [no steroids]). Deflazacort use resulted in slower average declines in FVC % -predicted vs. no steroids (+3.73 percentage points/year, p < 0.05). Both steroids were associated with significantly slower average declines in LVEF, improvement in CPF, and slower declines in total PUL score and EK total score vs. no steroids; deflazacort was associated with slower declines in total PUL score vs. prednisone (all p < 0.05). Both steroids also preserved functional abilities considered especially important to quality of life, including the abilities to perform hand-to-mouth function and to turn in bed at night unaided (all p < 0.05 vs. no steroids). CONCLUSIONS: Steroid use after loss of ambulation in DMD was associated with delayed progression of important pulmonary, cardiac, and upper extremity functional deficits, suggesting some benefits of deflazacort over prednisone.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked muscle disorder caused by a mutation or deletion in the dystrophin gene. In boys with DMD, muscle weakness progresses in a proximal to distal pattern, leading to gait abnormalities at all joints, in all planes of motion. Longitudinal studies are imperative to quantify changes in gait function due to DMD and are of particular importance when examining the efficacy of treatment interventions. RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study was to examine the sensitivity of the Gait Deviation Index (GDI) and Movement Analysis Profile (Gait Profile Score (GPS) and Gait Variable Score (GVS)) to quantify the longitudinal ambulatory decline in boys with DMD. A secondary aim was to quantify the effect of corticosteroid (CS) treatment. METHODS: The gait patterns of 75 boys were assessed longitudinally, 11 were steroid naïve (SN), and 64 received CS treatment. Joint kinematics were collected using either a VICON 612 or a Motion Analysis Corporation 3-D system. Representative trials were used to compute the GDI, GPS and the nine GVS for each boy for each visit. RESULTS: At baseline, GVS for the boys with DMD revealed abnormalities in all lower extremity joints and in all planes of movement compared to TD peers. GDI and GPS indices verified that the overall quality of gait in boys with DMD decreases at a significant rate with age. Boys who were steroid naïve changed at a rate 3 times greater than boys on CS in coronal plane hip motion. SIGNIFICANCE: The gait indices of GDI and GPS are able to identify changes in the quality of gait patterns in boys with DMD. Although boys on steroids had greater gait deviations than boys who were SN at baseline, the rate of decline in gait quality was slower in boys on CS.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study prospectively assessed putative promising biomarkers for use in assessing infants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). METHODS: This prospective, multi-center natural history study targeted the enrollment of SMA infants and healthy control infants less than 6 months of age. Recruitment occurred at 14 centers within the NINDS National Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) Network. Infant motor function scales and putative electrophysiological, protein and molecular biomarkers were assessed at baseline and subsequent visits. RESULTS: Enrollment began November, 2012 and ended September, 2014 with 26 SMA infants and 27 healthy infants enrolled. Baseline demographic characteristics of the SMA and control infant cohorts aligned well. Motor function as assessed by the Test for Infant Motor Performance Items (TIMPSI) and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) revealed significant differences between the SMA and control infants at baseline. Ulnar compound muscle action potential amplitude (CMAP) in SMA infants (1.4 ± 2.2 mV) was significantly reduced compared to controls (5.5 ± 2.0 mV). Electrical impedance myography (EIM) high-frequency reactance slope (Ohms/MHz) was significantly higher in SMA infants than controls SMA infants had lower survival motor neuron (SMN) mRNA levels in blood than controls, and several serum protein analytes were altered between cohorts. INTERPRETATION: By the time infants were recruited and presented for the baseline visit, SMA infants had reduced motor function compared to controls. Ulnar CMAP, EIM, blood SMN mRNA levels, and serum protein analytes were able to distinguish between cohorts at the enrollment visit.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Small cell undifferentiated (SCU) histology in hepatoblastoma (HB) tumors has historically been associated with a poor prognosis. Tumors from patients enrolled on Children's Oncology Group (COG) study AHEP0731 underwent institutional and central pathologic review for identification of SCU histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with SCU histology identified at the local treating institution who had otherwise low-risk tumors were upstaged to the intermediate-risk treatment stratum, whereas those only identified by retrospective central review were treated per the local institution as low-risk. Patients with otherwise intermediate- or high-risk tumors remained in that treatment stratum, respectively. Central review was to be performed for all tissue samples obtained at any time point. Treatment was per local review, whereas analysis of outcome was based on central review. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients had some elements (1%-25%) of SCU identified on central review of diagnostic specimens. All but two patient tissue sample retained nuclear INI1 expression. The presence of SCU histology did not correlate with age, alpha-fetoprotein level at diagnosis, or sex. The presence of SCU did not affect event-free survival (EFS). EFS at 5 years for patients with low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk with SCU HB was 86% (95% CI, 33 to 98), 81% (95% CI, 57 to 92), and 29% (95% CI, 4 to 61), respectively, compared with EFS at 5 years for patients without SCU enrolled with low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk of 87% (95% CI, 72 to 95), 88% (95% CI, 79 to 94), and 55% (95% CI, 32 to 74; P = .17), respectively. CONCLUSION: The presence of SCU histology in HB does not appear to adversely affect outcome. Future studies should be able to treat patients with SCU HB according to risk stratification without regard to the presence of SCU histology.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The occurrence of brain metastases (at diagnosis or at relapse) in patients with Wilms tumor is very rare. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of patients with Wilms tumor and relapse to the brain enrolled on the National Wilms Tumor Studies (NWTSs) 1-5. RESULTS: Intracranial relapse was documented in 47 patients (0.5%). Of the 45 patients with adequate data, 26 (58%) patients were male. Thirty-eight (84%) patients had favorable histology Wilms tumor. In 30 patients (67%), the appearance of intracranial disease was preceded by relapse at another site. Ten patients did not have any disease-directed therapy. Surgical resection was attempted in 15 patients; gross total resection was achieved in 11 patients. Twenty-nine patients received brain irradiation; the median dose was 3,000 cGy (range 1,080-4,000 cGy). Twenty-seven patients received chemotherapy. The 5-year overall survival from the time of intracranial relapse was 28.7% (95% confidence interval: 14.4-43.1%). Nine patients (all favorable histology Wilms tumor) were alive with a median follow-up from brain relapse of 140 months (range 35-381 months). All nine survivors received radiation therapy, eight received chemotherapy, and four underwent surgery (two gross total resection, two partial resection). The overall survival after brain metastases of the NWTS-5 patients was significantly higher than the overall survival of the NWTS 1-4 patients (P value = 0.029, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Wilms tumor recurrence involving the brain may have durable survival, particularly those treated in recent years. Multimodality therapy including radiation and chemotherapy should be considered for these patients.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To determine whether the pattern of lung nodules in children with metastatic hepatoblastoma (HB) correlates with outcome. Methods Thirty-two patients with metastatic HB were enrolled on Children's Oncology Group Protocol AHEP0731 and treated with vincristine and irinotecan (VI). Responders to VI received two additional cycles of VI intermixed with six cycles of cisplatin/fluorouracil/vincristine/doxorubicin (C5VD), and nonresponders received six cycles of C5VD alone. Patients were imaged after every two cycles and at the conclusion of therapy. All computed tomography scans and pathology reports were centrally reviewed, and information was collected regarding lung nodule number, size, laterality, timing of resolution, and pulmonary surgery. Results Among the 29 evaluable patients, only 31% met Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for measurable metastatic disease. The presence of measurable disease by RECIST, the sum of nodule diameters greater than or equal to the cumulative cohort median size, bilateral disease, and ≥ 10 nodules were each associated with an increased risk for an event-free survival event ( P = .48, P = .08, P = .065, P = .03, respectively), with nodule number meeting statistical significance. Ten patients underwent pulmonary resection/metastasectomy at various time points, the benefit of which could not be determined because of small patient numbers. Conclusion Children with metastatic HB have a poor prognosis. Overall tumor burden may be an important prognostic factor for these patients. Lesions that fail to meet RECIST size criteria (ie, those < 10 mm) at diagnosis may contain viable tumor, whereas residual lesions at the end of therapy may constitute eradicated tumor/scar tissue. Patients may benefit from risk stratification on the basis of the burden of lung metastatic disease at diagnosis.",

The Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration (CHIC) database was queried for patients with HB who had AFP levels less than 100 ng/mL at diagnosis or were historically diagnosed as SCU HBs. Seventy-three of 1605 patients in the CHIC database were originally identified as SCU HB, HB with SCU component, or HB with low AFP levels. Upon retrospective review, they were re-classified as rhabdoid tumors (n = 11), HB with SCU component (n = 41), and HB with low AFP (n = 14). Seven were excluded for erroneously low AFP levels. Overall survival was 0% for patients with rhabdoid tumors, 76% for patients with HB with SCU component, and 64% for patients with HB with AFP less than 100 ng/mL. Patients with HB with SCU component or low AFP should be assessed for SMARCB1 mutations and, if confirmed, treated as rhabdoid tumors. When rhabdoid tumors are excluded, the presence of SCU component and low AFP at diagnosis were not associated with poor prognosis in patients diagnosed with HB.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare, high-grade soft tissue tumor that requires multidisciplinary and multimodal care with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. We examined the impact of sociodemographic and clinical factors on treatment patterns and survival in localized SS patients. Methods: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs, 15-39 years) and older adults (\"adults,\" ≥40 years) diagnosed with localized SS from 2000 to 2018 were identified in the California Cancer Registry. Multivariable logistic regression identified clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors associated with overall survival (OS). Results are reported as odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs), respectively, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: More AYAs (n = 346) than adults (n = 272) received chemotherapy (47.7% vs. 36.4%) and radiotherapy (62.1% vs. 58.1%). Age at diagnosis, tumor size, treatment at National Cancer Institute-Children's Oncology Group (NCI-COG)-designated facilities, insurance status, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) influenced treatment patterns. Among AYAs, treatment at NCI-COG-designated facilities was associated with receiving chemotherapy (OR 2.74, CI 1.48-5.07) and low SES was associated with worse OS (HR 2.28, 1.09-4.77). In adults, high SES was associated with receiving chemoradiotherapy (OR 3.20, CI 1.40-7.31), whereas public insurance was associated with decreased odds of chemoradiotherapy (OR 0.44, CI 0.20-0.95). With regard to treatment, absence of radiotherapy (HR 1.94, CI 1.18-3.20) was associated with worse OS in adults. Conclusion: In localized SS, both clinical and sociodemographic factors influenced treatment patterns. Further research should investigate how SES-related factors produce treatment disparities and identify interventions to improve treatment equity and outcomes.",

The EWC harmonizes extant data and collects new data using a standardized protocol, the ECHO-Wide Cohort Data Collection Protocol (EWCP). EWCP visits occur at least once per life stage, but the frequency and timing of the visits vary across cohorts. As of March 4, 2022, the EWC cohorts contributed data from 60,553 children and consented 29,622 children for new EWCP data and biospecimen collection. The median (interquartile range) age of EWCP-enrolled children was 7.5 years (3.7-11.1). Surveys, interviews, standardized examinations, laboratory analyses, and medical record abstraction are used to obtain information in 5 main outcome areas: pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes; neurodevelopment; obesity; airways; and positive health. Exposures include factors at the level of place (e.g., air pollution, neighborhood socioeconomic status), family (e.g., parental mental health), and individuals (e.g., diet, genomics).",

        "abstract": "There is a need to consider paternal contributions to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) more strongly. Autism etiology is complex, and heritability is not explained by genetics alone. Understanding paternal gametic epigenetic contributions to autism could help fill this knowledge gap. In the present study, we explored whether paternal autistic traits, and the sperm epigenome, were associated with autistic traits in children at 36 months enrolled in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) cohort. EARLI is a pregnancy cohort that recruited and enrolled pregnant women in the first half of pregnancy who already had a child with ASD. After maternal enrollment, EARLI fathers were approached and asked to provide a semen specimen. Participants were included in the present study if they had genotyping, sperm methylation data, and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) score data available. Using the CHARM array, we performed genome-scale methylation analyses on DNA from semen samples contributed by EARLI fathers. The SRS-a 65-item questionnaire measuring social communication deficits on a quantitative scale-was used to evaluate autistic traits in EARLI fathers (n = 45) and children (n = 31). We identified 94 significant child SRS-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and 14 significant paternal SRS-associated DMRs (fwer p < 0.05). Many child SRS-associated DMRs were annotated to genes implicated in ASD and neurodevelopment. Six DMRs overlapped across the two outcomes (fwer p < 0.1), and, 16 DMRs overlapped with previous child autistic trait findings at 12 months of age (fwer p < 0.05). Child SRS-associated DMRs contained CpG sites independently found to be differentially methylated in postmortem brains of individuals with and without autism. These findings suggest paternal germline methylation is associated with autistic traits in 3-year-old offspring. These prospective results for autism-associated traits, in a cohort with a family history of ASD, highlight the potential importance of sperm epigenetic mechanisms in autism.",

        "abstract": "A growing body of literature suggests that developmental exposure to individual or mixtures of environmental chemicals (ECs) is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, investigating the effect of interactions among these ECs can be challenging. We introduced a combination of the classical exposure-mixture Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression and a machine-learning method termed Signed iterative Random Forest (SiRF) to discover synergistic interactions between ECs that are (1) associated with higher odds of ASD diagnosis, (2) mimic toxicological interactions, and (3) are present only in a subset of the sample whose chemical concentrations are higher than certain thresholds. In a case-control Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) study, we evaluated multiordered synergistic interactions among 62 ECs measured in the urine samples of 479 children in association with increased odds for ASD diagnosis (yes vs no). WQS-SiRF identified two synergistic two-ordered interactions between (1) trace-element cadmium (Cd) and the organophosphate pesticide metabolite diethyl-phosphate (DEP); and (2) 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP-246) and DEP. Both interactions were suggestively associated with increased odds of ASD diagnosis in the subset of children with urinary concentrations of Cd, DEP, and TCP-246 above the 75th percentile. This study demonstrates a novel method that combines the inferential power of WQS and the predictive accuracy of machine-learning algorithms to discover potentially biologically relevant chemical-chemical interactions associated with ASD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phthalates are a group of chemicals with ubiquitous exposure worldwide. Exposures to phthalates during pregnancy may play a role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) etiology by disrupting hormone levels or directly impacting fetal neurodevelopment. However, there is little research quantifying the aggregate effect of phthalates on child ASD-related behaviors. METHODS: We used data from two prospective pregnancy and birth cohorts-the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI). HOME is a general population cohort while participants in EARLI were at higher familial risk for ASD. Using quantile g-computation and linear regression models, we assessed the joint and individual associations of a mixture of six phthalate metabolites during pregnancy with child ASD-related traits measured by Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores at ages 3-8 years. RESULTS: Our analyses included 271 participants from HOME and 166 participants from EARLI. There were imprecise associations between the phthalate mixture and SRS total raw scores in HOME (difference in SRS scores per decile increase in every phthalate = 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.2, 2.8) and EARLI (difference in SRS scores per decile increase in every phthalate = -0.9; 95% CI = -3.5, 1.7). CONCLUSIONS: The cohort-specific effect sizes of the pthalates-SRS associations were small and CIs were imprecise. These results suggest that if there are associations between phthalate metabolites during pregnancy and child SRS scores, they may differ across populations with different familial liabilities. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.",

        "issued": "2024-01",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current acceptable chemical exposure levels (e.g., tolerable daily intake) are mainly based on animal experiments, which are costly, time-consuming, considered non-ethical by many, and may poorly predict adverse outcomes in humans. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a method using human in vitro data and biological modeling to calculate an acceptable exposure level through a case study on 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) developmental neurotoxicity (DNT). METHODS: We reviewed the literature on in vitro assays studying BDE-47-induced DNT. Using the most sensitive endpoint, we derived a point of departure using a mass-balance in vitro disposition model and benchmark dose modeling for a 5% response (BMC05) in cells. We subsequently used a pharmacokinetic model of gestation and lactation to estimate administered equivalent doses leading to four different metrics of child brain concentration (i.e., average prenatal, average postnatal, average overall, and maximum concentration) equal to the point of departure. The administered equivalent doses were translated into tolerable daily intakes using uncertainty factors. Finally, we calculated biomonitoring equivalents for maternal serum and compared them to published epidemiological studies of DNT. RESULTS: We calculated a BMC05 of 164 μg/kg of cells for BDE-47 induced alteration of differentiation in neural progenitor cells. We estimated administered equivalent doses of 0.925-3.767 μg/kg/day in mothers, and tolerable daily intakes of 0.009-0.038 μg/kg/day (composite uncertainty factor: 100). The lowest derived biomonitoring equivalent was 19.75 ng/g lipids, which was consistent with reported median (0.9-23 ng/g lipids) and geometric mean (7.02-26.9 ng/g lipids) maternal serum concentrations from epidemiological studies. CONCLUSION: This case study supports using in vitro data and biological modeling as a viable alternative to animal testing to derive acceptable exposure levels.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue cracking due to repeated truck traffic loads is the leading cause of failure of asphalt concrete pavement in many locations. Rest periods, referring to the time intervals between successive trucks, may allow for partial or full recovery from fatigue damage and in turn extend pavement fatigue life. This paper delves into the characteristics of rest periods between highway truck traffic loads using traffic data from 40 weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations installed on California state highways and evaluates their effects on pavement performance using mechanistic-empirical incremental-recursive damage and cracking simulation (CalME software). Toward this purpose, truck traffic data were extracted from these WIM stations at selected periods throughout the year 2015 to calculate rest periods. The probability distribution of rest periods and quantiles of cumulative rest periods were calculated, respectively. Regression and statistical analysis for 0.5 quantiles (median) of cumulative rest periods were also performed for different spectra groups and seasons. It was found that rest periods are strongly correlated with the truck traffic volume regardless of the WIM station location and seasons of the year. The actual rest periods based on the nonuniform truck traffic measured from the WIM data were found to be slightly shorter than the corresponding theoretical average rest periods for uniform traffic (ARP-UT) currently assumed in CalME, likely due to truck-following. This theoretical value assumes an equal time interval between trucks all the time. After comparing pavement performance with and without rest periods, it was found that rest periods have a significant influence (30% in difference) on pavement cracking performance in the modeling. Based on this preliminary analysis, the difference in pavement performance caused by the difference between the actual rest periods and ARP-UT is minimal. It is therefore recommended to continue to use ARP-UT to account for the effect of rest periods in pavement design.",

        "abstract": "Plant-produced asphalt mixes can be stored in the silo for a few hours prior to being transported to the construction site. The mixes undergo additional aging during silo storage because of the high temperature in the silo. This additional aging of the mixes is not accounted for during the mix design process and could greatly influence the mix properties. Additional blending between the virgin and recycled binder could also take place in mixes containing reclaimed asphalt pavement or reclaimed asphalt shingles. In this study, four asphalt mixes were collected from different regions within California before and after silo storage. The plant-produced mixes were sampled at the hot drop point directly from the plant discharge, as well as from the silo after storage for 5-16 h. The rutting and cracking behavior of the mixes was assessed using the Hamburg wheel tracking (HWT) test, the repeated load triaxial (RLT) test, and the indirect tensile asphalt cracking test (IDEAL-CT). The rut depth from the HWT test, the flow number and cycles at 5 % permanent strain from the unconfined RLT test, and the CTindex from the IDEAL-CT were determined before and after silo storage. The results clearly show that the silo storage has a notable effect on both the rutting and cracking resistance, even for short durations (i.e., 5-6 h). The rutting resistance, as given by the HWT results, increased for three out of the four mixes after silo storage, whereas the cracking resistance decreased for all mixes.",

The reflection properties combine diffuse and specular components. The specular reflection component changes with different materials: it also changes when the surface is wet, although this is sometimes ignored in lighting design. This study used simulation (DIALux 4.13) to investigate the effect on lighting parameters (luminance, overall uniformity, longitudinal uniformity and threshold increment (TI)) of changes in pavement reflection properties using different pavement materials and under dry and wet conditions. Furthermore, comparison of lighting parameters was made with different road lighting arrangements. The results show that an increase in the specular reflection component leads to an increase in luminance and a decrease in uniformity. Of the surfaces investigated, the porous pavement had the lower luminance but better uniformity. Arranging the lighting installation based on the extreme wettest condition could make luminance and uniformity rise but with an increase of 2–2.5 kWh/m2 annual energy consumption. When trying to control glare problems during design process, it is suggested that uniformity cannot be neglected except the TI.",

The BMD used three RAs (aromatic extract, triglycerides and fatty acids, and tall oil), an amidoamine WMA additive (PAWMA®), and an anti-stripping agent (Zycotherm®). The Dynamic Creep (DC), Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS), and Semi-Circular Bending (SCB) fracture tests were respectively used to evaluate the rutting, moisture susceptibility, and cracking resistance of mixtures. In addition, two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2-D and 3-D) performance interaction diagrams were developed as typical approaches for the BMD of asphalt mixtures. For mixtures with RAP, the results indicated that the aromatic extract and tall oil RAs decreased the moisture susceptibility, while triglycerides and fatty acids increased the moisture susceptibility. In addition, the RAs generally decreased the rutting resistance of mixtures while they increased the cracking resistance. This effect was more noticeable in the mixtures treated with triglycerides and fatty acids. The results also showed that introducing PAWMA® and Zycotherm® to the mixtures improved their resistance to moisture damage, cracking, and rutting.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immunosurveillance of the central nervous system (CNS) is vital to resolve infection and injury. However, immune activation within the CNS in the setting of chronic viral infections, such as HIV-1, is strongly linked to progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Establishment of HIV-1 in the CNS early following infection underscores the need to delineate features of acute CNS immune activation, as these early inflammatory events may mediate neurodegenerative processes. Here, we focused on elucidating molecular programs of neuroinflammation in brain regions based on vulnerability to neuroAIDS and/or neurocognitive decline. To this end, we assessed transcriptional profiles within the subcortical white matter of the pre-frontal cortex (PFCw), as well as synapse dense regions from hippocampus, superior temporal cortex, and caudate nucleus, in rhesus macaques following infection with Simian/Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV.C.CH505). METHODS: We performed RNA extraction and sequenced RNA isolated from 3 mm brain punches. Viral RNA was quantified in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid by RT-qPCR assays targeting SIV Gag. Neuroinflammation was assessed by flow cytometry and multiplex ELISA assays. RESULTS: RNA sequencing and flow cytometry data demonstrated immune surveillance of the rhesus CNS by innate and adaptive immune cells during homeostasis. Following SHIV infection, viral entry and integration within multiple brain regions demonstrated vulnerabilities of key cognitive and motor function brain regions to HIV-1 during the acute phase of infection. SHIV-induced transcriptional alterations were concentrated to the PFCw and STS with upregulation of gene expression pathways controlling innate and T-cell inflammatory responses. Within the PFCw, gene modules regulating microglial activation and T cell differentiation were induced at 28 days post-SHIV infection, with evidence for stimulation of immune effector programs characteristic of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, enrichment of pathways regulating mitochondrial respiratory capacity, synapse assembly, and oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress were observed. These acute neuroinflammatory features were substantiated by increased influx of activated T cells into the CNS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show pervasive immune surveillance of the rhesus CNS at homeostasis and reveal perturbations of important immune, neuronal, and synaptic pathways within key anatomic regions controlling cognition and motor function during acute HIV infection. These findings provide a valuable framework to understand early molecular features of HIV associated neurodegeneration.",

        "abstract": "The median eminence (ME) of the hypothalamus comprises the hypothalamic nerve terminals, glia (especially tanycytes) and the portal capillary vasculature that transports hypothalamic neurohormones to the anterior pituitary gland. The ultrastructure of the ME is dynamically regulated by hormones and undergoes organizational changes during development and reproductive cycles in adult females, but relatively little is known about the ME during aging, especially in nonhuman primates. Therefore, we used a novel transmission scanning electron microscopy technique to examine the cytoarchitecture of the ME of young and aged female rhesus macaques in a preclinical monkey model of menopausal hormone treatments. Rhesus macaques were ovariectomized and treated for 2 years with vehicle, estradiol (E2), or estradiol + progesterone (E2 + P4). While the overall cytoarchitecture of the ME underwent relatively few changes with age and hormones, changes to some features of neural and glial components near the portal capillaries were observed. Specifically, large neuroterminal size was greater in aged compared to young adult animals, an effect that was mitigated or reversed by E2 alone but not by E2 + P4 treatment. Overall glial size and the density and tissue fraction of the largest subset of glia were greater in aged monkeys, and in some cases reversed by E2 treatment. Mitochondrial size was decreased by E2, but not E2 + P4, only in aged macaques. These results contrast substantially with work in rodents, suggesting that the ME of aging macaques is less vulnerable to age-related disorganization, and that the effects of E2 on monkeys' ME are age specific.",

        "abstract": "The dementia of Alzheimer's disease (AD) results primarily from degeneration of neurons that furnish glutamatergic corticocortical connections that subserve cognition. Although neuron death is minimal in the absence of AD, age-related cognitive decline does occur in animals as well as humans, and it decreases quality of life for elderly people. Age-related cognitive decline has been linked to synapse loss and/or alterations of synaptic proteins that impair function in regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These synaptic alterations are likely reversible, such that maintenance of synaptic health in the face of aging is a critically important therapeutic goal. Here, we show that riluzole can protect against some of the synaptic alterations in hippocampus that are linked to age-related memory loss in rats. Riluzole increases glutamate uptake through glial transporters and is thought to decrease glutamate spillover to extrasynaptic NMDA receptors while increasing synaptic glutamatergic activity. Treated aged rats were protected against age-related cognitive decline displayed in nontreated aged animals. Memory performance correlated with density of thin spines on apical dendrites in CA1, although not with mushroom spines. Furthermore, riluzole-treated rats had an increase in clustering of thin spines that correlated with memory performance and was specific to the apical, but not the basilar, dendrites of CA1. Clustering of synaptic inputs is thought to allow nonlinear summation of synaptic strength. These findings further elucidate neuroplastic changes in glutamatergic circuits with aging and advance therapeutic development to prevent and treat age-related cognitive decline.",

        "abstract": "Ozone (O3) is widely recognized as a significant air pollutant that affects public health across the globe. O3 is formed from precursor emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react in the atmosphere, making it complex to identify the major source contributions to O3 concentrations. O3 source apportionment calculations within chemical transport models (CTMs) provide a specialized approach to resolve source contributions. Traditional O3 apportionment techniques track source contributions based on the chemical formation regime, but they do not separately distinguish between NOx and VOC source contributions. In this study, a new O3 source apportionment technique was developed to explicitly resolve the contributions from both NOx and VOC sources in order to provide a more detailed view on O3 source origins so that policy makers can design more effective emission control strategies. The new technique is flexible and can be configured to identify the original source of precursors that contribute to O3 formation or the most recent source depending on the choice of the tagging method. The detailed features of the new technique are demonstrated during a peak O3 event in September 2010 in Los Angeles, while trends in O3 source contributions over time are evaluated during two additional simulations in July 2005 and August 2015. Quality control checks show that the new source apportionment methodology does not alter predicted total O3 concentrations, and the detailed source apportionment information can be averaged to yield results that are consistent with traditional O3 source apportionment calculations. The detailed O3 source apportionment results during Sept 2010 show that, among NOx sources, on-road gasoline, on-road diesel, off-road diesel, and soil NOx account for over 60% of the ground level O3 concentrations. Among VOC sources, upwind boundary conditions and biogenic sources account for approximately 90% of the ground-level O3 formed. The formaldehyde to NO2 ratio suggests that the chemical regime in the year 2015 was VOC-limited, but given the uncontrollable nature of the VOC emissions, the results suggest that NOx emission controls would have been the preferred emission control strategy to reduce O3 concentration in Los Angeles at that time, with the understanding that some period of O3 disbenefits would need to be tolerated until the emissions control program shifts the atmospheric chemistry back into the NOx-limited regime. The NOx source apportionment results for O3 identify the largest NOx sources that could be reduced in an effort to reach NOx-limited conditions. The chemical regime in the Los Angeles atmosphere is continuously evolving, and so these calculations would need to be repeated under current conditions to determine if we have arrived at this NOx limited regime. Future studies will undertake this analysis.",

        "abstract": "An Environmental Justice (EJ) analysis was carried out using full Chemical Transport Models (CTMs) over Los Angeles, California, to determine how the combination of domain size and spatial resolution affects predicted air pollution disparities in present day and future simulations when data support from measurements is not available. One set of simulations used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) with spatial resolution ranging from 250 m to 36 km, comparable to census tract sizes, over domains ranging in size from 320 km2 to 10,000 km2. A second set of simulations used the UCD/CIT CTM with spatial resolution ranging from 4 km to 24 km over domains ranging in size from 98,000 km2 to 1,000,000 km2. Overall WRF/Chem model accuracy improved approximately 9% as spatial resolution increased from 4 km to 250 m in present-day simulations, with similar results expected for future simulations. Exposure disparity results are consistent with previous findings: the average Non-Hispanic White person in the study domain experiences PM2.5 mass concentrations 6-14% lower than the average resident, while the average Black and African American person experiences PM2.5 mass concentrations that are 3-22% higher than the average resident. Predicted exposure disparities were a function of the model configuration. Increasing the spatial resolution finer than approximately 1 km produced diminishing returns because the increased spatial resolution came at the expense of reduced domain size in order to maintain reasonable computational burden. Increasing domain size to capture regional trends, such as wealthier populations living in coastal areas, identified larger exposure disparities but the benefits were limited. CTM configurations that use spatial resolution/domain size of 1 km/103 km2 and 4 km/104 km2 over Los Angeles can detect a 0.5 μg m-3 exposure difference with statistical power greater than 90%. These configurations represent a balanced approach between statistical power, sensitivity across socio-economic groups, and computational burden when predicting current and future air pollution exposure disparities in Los Angeles.",

Particles emitted from different sources within the same general class can be differentiated from each other with this technique; for example particles emitted by on-road diesel vehicles can be distinguished from particles emitted by diesel railroad locomotives, and particles emitted from identical sources at different locations can be distinguished from each other as well. The method developed is illustrated by application to the air quality situation in Southern California. The contributions of more than 50 types of air pollution sources to primary particle concentrations at Claremont, CA, are separated from each other by post-processing the output from the aerosol processes trajectory model for an externally mixed aerosol developed previously by Kleeman and Cass (1998, Atmospheric Environment 32, 2803-2816; 1999 Environmental Science and Technology, 33, 177-189).

        "abstract": "The predicted behavior of the size- and chemical-composition distribution of airborne particles in the Los Angeles area is examined as it changes in response to specific emissions control strategies. Model calculations indicate that strategies currently envisioned to control the emissions of primary particles in the Los Angeles area effectively reduce the atmospheric concentrations of particles between 0.1-0.3 μm particle diameter and above 2.5 μm particle diameter but do little to reduce particulate concentrations between 0.6 and 0.8 μm particle diameter. Analysis reveals that in Los Angeles, most atmospheric particles with diameters between 0.6- 0.8 μm begin as water-soluble nonsea salt background particles over the Pacific Ocean which then are transformed by significant accumulation of gas- to-particle conversion products as they are advected across the urban area. Control of primary particulate emissions alone does not reduce the amount of secondary aerosol which forms in the atmosphere and may even serve to redistribute this secondary material to particles with diameters that scatter light more efficiently. Strategies originally designed to reduce ambient ozone concentrations through the control of emissions of reactive organic gases (ROG) and oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)) would reduce fine particle mass concentrations at Claremont CA on August 28, 1987 by 9.5% under the conditions studied here, primarily by reducing aerosol nitrate concentrations. Additional controls on ammonia emissions would suppress aerosol nitrate formation further. The simultaneous use of all gas-phase and particle-phase emissions control measures studied here would reduce atmospheric particle concentrations by 46% at Claremont, CA, relative to the base case 1987 summer conditions.",

        "abstract": "A Lagrangian air quality model is developed which represents the airborne particle complex as a source-oriented external mixture. In a source-oriented external mixture, particles of the same size can evolve to display different chemical compositions that depend on the chemical and hygroscopic properties of the primary seed particles initially emitted from different sources. In contrast, previous models initialize the airborne particles as an internal mixture in which all particles of the same size are assumed to have the same chemical composition. Test cases show that representation of the aerosol as an internal mixture can distort the predicted particle composition and concentration in the HNO3/NH3/HCl/H2SO4/aerosol Cl-/SO=4/NO-3/NH +4/Na+ system when Na+ and SO=4 exist in separate particles, as may occur when sea spray coexists with long-distance transport of anthropogenic sulfates. Tests also indicate that the external mixture model can predict the evolution of a nearly monodisperse aerosol into a bimodally distributed aerosol as relative humidity increases, qualitatively matching observations. The source-oriented external mixture model is applied to predict the size and composition distribution of airborne particles observed at Claremont, California, on August 28, 1987. Calculations produce an aerosol mass distribution that is distinctly bimodal in the size range from 0.1 μm to 1.0 μm particle diameter, matching field observations. External mixture calculations also predict specific differences in composition between particles of the same diameter. The external mixture model is expected to have applications including exploration of the cause of the particle-to-particle differences seen by time-of-flight mass spectrometers that measure single particle size and composition in the atmosphere.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe fentanyl pharmacokinetics during isoflurane anesthesia and on recovery from anesthesia with concurrent administration of acepromazine, dexmedetomidine or saline in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental blinded, randomized, crossover study. ANIMALS: Seven adult hound dogs. METHODS: Dogs were administered intravenous (IV) fentanyl as a bolus (5 μg kg(-1)) followed by an infusion (5 μg kg(-1) hour(-1)) for 120 minutes during isoflurane anesthesia and emergence from anesthesia, and for 60 minutes after extubation during recovery from anesthesia. At the time of extubation, dexmedetomidine (2.5 μg kg(-1)), acepromazine (0.05 mg kg(-1)) or saline were administered IV. Venous blood was sampled during the maintenance and recovery periods. Fentanyl plasma concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean fentanyl plasma concentrations were 1.6-4.5 ng mL(-1) during isoflurane anesthesia and 1.6-2.0 ng mL(-1) during recovery from anesthesia. Recovery from isoflurane anesthesia without sedation was associated with an increase in the volume of the central compartment from 0.80 to 1.02 L kg(-1). After administration of acepromazine, systemic clearance of fentanyl increased from 31.5 to 40.3 mL minute(-1) kg(-1) and the volume of the central compartment increased from 0.70 to 0.94 L kg(-1). Administration of dexmedetomidine did not significantly change fentanyl pharmacokinetics. Inter-individual variability for fentanyl parameter estimates in all treatments ranged from 2.2% to 54.5%, and residual error ranged from 6.3% to 13.4%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The dose rates of fentanyl used in this study achieved previously established analgesic plasma concentrations for the duration of the infusion. Despite alterations in fentanyl pharmacokinetics, differences in fentanyl plasma concentrations among treatments during recovery from anesthesia were small and were unlikely to be of clinical significance.",

The disease, colloquially known as \"fluid belly,\" causes morbidity and mortality in adult animals resulting in significant economic losses to the aquaculture industry. Advancements in therapeutic and prophylactic protocols have been partially hampered by the lack of basic protocols to grow and manipulate the fungus in the laboratory. In this study, microbroth kinetic protocols were established to analyse V. botryosa growth in seven nutrient media at different temperatures. Generated area under the curve (AUC) indicates that potato flake dextrose broth (PFD-B) and Sabouraud dextrose broth (SD-B) incubated at 25°C provided the greatest growth. The generated protocol was then used to test the susceptibility of V. botryosa isolates to natamycin, a macrolide polyene antifungal agent used as a food preservative. SD-B and RPMI with l-glutamine (+RPMI-B) containing different concentrations of natamycin were inoculated with V. botryosa conidia and the generated growth curves were compared using cubic smoothing spline model. The non-inhibitory concentration and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC; decrease of AUC by 90% compared with control) were determined to be <1 μg/mL and 16 μg/mL of natamycin in SD-B media. To gain an understanding of the tissue distribution of natamycin in white sturgeon, pharmacokinetics was tested. Based on pharmacokinetic parameters determined in this study and targeting a blood concentration >16 μg/mL for 24 h, an intravenous dose >1 g/kg would be needed, making the use of this drug unrealistic. The information presented in this study can be used to investigate susceptibility of pathogenic fungus to antimicrobials and disinfectants as well as support future therapeutic protocols against emerging fungal diseases like fluid belly.",

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized balanced crossover study. ANIMALS: A total of seven University-owned horses, five mares and two geldings, aged 3-6 years. METHODS: Horses were treated with a single intravenous dosage of saline, morphine (0.2 mg kg-1), M6G (0.01 mg kg-1) and M3G (0.03 mg kg-1). Blood was collected prior to (baseline) and at several times post administration. Drug and metabolite concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and plasma pharmacokinetics were calculated. Behavioral observations and physiologic variables (heart rate, step counts, packed cell volume, total plasma protein and gastrointestinal sounds) were determined at baseline and for up to 6 hours. The effects on thermal nociception were determined and thermal excursion was calculated. RESULTS: The volumes of distribution were 4.75-10.5, 0.244-0.295 and 0.215-0.356 L kg-1 for morphine, M6G and M3G, respectively. Systemic clearances were 26.8-39.6, 3.16-3.88 and 1.46-2.13 mL minute-1 kg-1 for morphine, M6G and M3G, respectively. Morphine administration resulted in signs of excitation as evidenced by an increase in step counts and subjective behavioral observations, whereas M6G and M3G, based on the same criteria, appeared to cause sedative-like effects. Significant effects on thermal nociception were observed until 4 hours post morphine administration, 1 hour post M6G administration and at various times post M3G administration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of this study provide additional information regarding the use of morphine in horses. Less locomotor excitation and gastrointestinal adverse effects, compared with morphine, coupled with favorable effects on thermal nociception are encouraging for further study of the pharmacodynamics of both M6G and M3G in horses.",

Synovial fluid concentrations were above the LOQ (0.1 ng/mL) of the assay at 24 hours in both dose groups. Drug was not detected in urine samples at any time postdrug administration. CS846 concentrations were significantly decreased relative to baseline at 12 hours postadministration in the saline group and significantly increased in the 5-μg/kg-dose group at 24 hours. Concentrations of C2C were significantly decreased at 12 and 24 hours postadministration in the saline treatment group. There were no significant differences in CS846 or C2C concentrations between dose groups at any time. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Systemic concentrations of dexmedetomidine remained low, compared to synovial fluid concentrations. CS846, a marker of articular cartilage synthesis, increased in a dose-dependent fashion. Based on these findings, further dose titration and investigation of analgesic and adverse effects are warranted.",

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether orally administered acetaminophen penetrates the aqueous humour of the normal equine eye and report an aqueous humour:serum acetaminophen concentration ratio in horses. STUDY DESIGN: In vivo experiment. METHODS: Six privately owned horses with normal ophthalmic examinations weighing 568 ± 65 kg (mean ± standard deviation) and aged 11 ± 4 years were given 20 mg/kg acetaminophen orally every 12 h for a total of six doses. Physical exam parameters were recorded prior to, during, and after the dosing period. One hour after the final dose, horses were sedated and simultaneous aqueous humour and serum samples were collected and analysed for acetaminophen concentrations and selected eicosanoids. An aqueous humour:serum acetaminophen concentration ratio was calculated. A second aqueous humour sample was taken and analysed for eicosanoid concentrations 3 months after acetaminophen dosing. Physical exam data were compared between time points using a mixed model analysis (significance p < 0.05). RESULTS: Acetaminophen was detected in both serum and aqueous humour of all horses and mean ± standard deviation aqueous humour:serum acetaminophen concentration ratio was 44.9 ± 15.9%. No significant changes in physical exam parameters occurred during or after dosing. Eicosanoids were not detected in aqueous humour at any sampling point. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Presence of acetaminophen in the aqueous humour may not relate to clinical effect. A therapeutic level of acetaminophen has not been determined in horses, and the absence of ocular inflammation does not reflect conditions in which acetaminophen may be used. CONCLUSIONS: Acetaminophen readily penetrates the aqueous humour of the normal equine eye after consecutive oral dosing. Further study is required to determine whether acetaminophen is useful in the treatment of ocular pain and inflammation.",

Many Type II SNe show signs of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) during the first few days after explosion, implying that their red supergiant (RSG) progenitors experience episodic or eruptive mass loss. However, because it is difficult to discover SNe early, the diversity of CSM configurations in RSGs has not been fully mapped. SN 2021yja, first detected within ≈ 5.4 hours of explosion, shows some signatures of CSM interaction (high UV luminosity and radio and x-ray emission) but without the narrow emission lines or early light-curve peak that can accompany CSM. Here we analyze the densely sampled early light curve and spectral series of this nearby SN to infer the properties of its progenitor and CSM. We find that the most likely progenitor was an RSG with an extended envelope, encompassed by low-density CSM. We also present archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the host galaxy of SN 2021yja, which allows us to place a stringent upper limit of ≲ 9 M ☉ on the progenitor mass. However, this is in tension with some aspects of the SN evolution, which point to a more massive progenitor. Our analysis highlights the need to consider progenitor structure when making inferences about CSM properties, and that a comprehensive view of CSM tracers should be made to give a fuller view of the last years of RSG evolution.",

        "abstract": "We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of the site of SN 2015bh in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2770 taken between 2017 and 2019, nearly four years after the peak of the explosion. In 2017-2018, the transient fades steadily in optical filters before declining more slowly to F814W = -7.1 mag in 2019, ≈4 mag below the level of its eruptive luminous blue variable (LBV) progenitor observed with HST in 2008-2009. The source fades at a constant color of F555W - F814W = 0.4 mag until 2018, similar to SN 2009ip and consistent with a spectrum dominated by interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM). A deep optical spectrum obtained in 2021 lacks signatures of ongoing interaction (L Hα 2 1038 erg s-1 for broadened emission 22000 km s-1), but indicates the presence of a nearby H ii region ( 2300 pc). The color evolution of the fading source makes it unlikely that emission from a scattered-light echo or binary OB companion of the progenitor contributes significantly to the flattening of the late-time light curve. The remaining emission in 2019 may plausibly be attributed an evolved/inflated companion or an unresolved ( 23 pc), young stellar cluster. Importantly, the color evolution of SN 2015bh rules out scenarios in which the surviving progenitor is obscured by nascent dust and does not clearly indicate a transition to a hotter, optically faint state. The simplest explanation is that the massive progenitor did not survive. SN 2015bh likely represents a remarkable example of the terminal explosion of a massive star preceded by decades of end-stage eruptive variability.",

For a star with the mass of the Sun (M⊙) and a non-spinning black hole with a mass <108M⊙, the tidal radius lies outside the black hole event horizon2 and the disruption results in a luminous flare3-6. Here we report observations over a period of ten months of a transient, hitherto interpreted7 as a superluminous supernova8. Our data show that the transient rebrightened substantially in the ultraviolet and that the spectrum went through three different spectroscopic phases without ever becoming nebular. Our observations are more consistent with a tidal disruption event than a superluminous supernova because of the temperature evolution6, the presence of highly ionized CNO gas in the line of sight9 and our improved localization of the transient in the nucleus of a passive galaxy, where the presence of massive stars is highly unlikely10,11. While the supermassive black hole has a mass >108M⊙ 12,13, a star with the same mass as the Sun could be disrupted outside the event horizon if the black hole were spinning rapidly14. The rapid spin and high black hole mass can explain the high luminosity of this event.",

We also use an additional set of 21 91T/99aa-like SNe Ia and 87 normal SNe Ia from the literature for an analysis of the standardizability of the luminosity of 91T/99aa-like SNe. We find that 91T/99aa-like SNe are 0.2 mag brighter than normal SNe Ia, even when fully corrected by the light-curve shapes and colors. The weighted rms of the 91T/99aa-like SNe (with z CMB > 0.01) Hubble residuals is 0.25 ± 0.03 mag, suggesting that 91T/99aa-like SNe are also excellent relative distance indicators to ±12%. We compare the Hubble residuals with the pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) of Si ii λλ6355 around the date of maximum brightness. We find that there is a broken linear correlation between those two measurements for our sample including both 91T/99aa-like and normal SNe Ia. As the pEW max (Si ii λλ6355) increases, the Hubble residual increases when pEW max (Si ii λλ6355) < 55.6 Å. However, the Hubble residual stays constant beyond this. Given that 91T/99aa-like SNe possess shallower Si ii lines than normal SNe Ia, the linear correlation at pEW max (Si ii λλ6355) < 55.6 Å can account for the overall discrepancy of Hubble residuals derived from the two subgroups. Such a systematic effect needs to be taken into account when using SNe Ia to measure luminosity distances.",

Early, high-cadence light curves from both TESS and the DLT40 survey tightly constrain the time of explosion, and show a 30 day rise to maximum light followed by a near-constant linear decline in luminosity. Optical spectroscopy over the first 40 days revealed a reddened object with narrow Balmer emission lines seen in Type IIn SNe. The slow rise to maximum in the optical light curve combined with the lack of broad Hα emission suggest the presence of very optically thick and close circumstellar material (CSM) that quickly decelerated the SN ejecta. This CSM was likely created from a massive star progenitor with an Ṁ ∼0.2 M yr-1 lost in a previous eruptive episode 3-4 yr before eruption, similar to giant eruptions of luminous blue variable stars. At late times, strong intermediate-width Ca ii, Fe i, and Fe ii lines are seen in the optical spectra, identical to those seen in the superluminous interacting SN 2006gy. The strong CSM interaction masks the underlying explosion mechanism in SN 2019esa, but the combination of the luminosity, strength of the Hα lines, and mass-loss rate of the progenitor seem to be inconsistent with a Type Ia CSM model and instead point to a core-collapse origin.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disorder associated with cognitive dysfunction that alters the brain's functional connectivity. Assessing these alterations has become a topic of increasing interest. However, a few studies have examined different stages of AD from a complex network perspective that cover different topological scales. This study used resting state fMRI data to analyze the trend of functional connectivity alterations from a cognitively normal (CN) state through early and late mild cognitive impairment (EMCI and LMCI) and to Alzheimer's disease. The analyses had been done at the local (hubs and activated links and areas), meso (clustering, assortativity, and rich-club), and global (small-world, small-worldness, and efficiency) topological scales. The results showed that the trends of changes in the topological architecture of the functional brain network were not entirely proportional to the AD progression. There were network characteristics that have changed non-linearly regarding the disease progression, especially at the earliest stage of the disease, i.e., EMCI. Further, it has been indicated that the diseased groups engaged somatomotor, frontoparietal, and default mode modules compared to the CN group. The diseased groups also shifted the functional network towards more random architecture. In the end, the methods introduced in this paper enable us to gain an extensive understanding of the pathological changes of the AD process.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) have significant delays in cognition and language, as well as anxiety, symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, and challenging behaviors such as hyperactivity and aggression. Biological mothers of children with FXS, who are themselves FMR1 premutation or full mutation carriers, are at elevated risk for mental health challenges in addition to experiencing stress associated with parenting a child with significant disabilities. However, little is known about fathers in these families, including the ways in which parental well-being influences the mother-father relationship and the impact of child characteristics on paternal and couple functioning. METHOD: The current study examined features of, and relationships between, parental well-being, couple well-being, and child functioning in 23 families of young boys with FXS. Mothers and fathers independently completed multiple questionnaires about their individual well-being, couple functioning, and child behavior. One parent per family also completed an interview about the child's adaptive skills. RESULTS: Results suggest that both mothers and fathers in these families experience clinically significant levels of mental health challenges and elevated rates of parenting stress relative to the general population. Findings also indicate that the couples' relationship may be a source of strength that potentially buffers against some of the daily stressors faced by these families. Additionally, parents who reported less parenting stress had higher couples satisfaction and dyadic coping. Finally, parents of children with less severe challenging behaviors exhibited fewer mental health challenges, less parenting stress, and higher levels of both couples satisfaction and dyadic coping. Parents of children with higher levels of adaptive behavior also reported less parenting stress and higher couples satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provides evidence that families of children with FXS need access to services that not only target improvements in the child's functioning, but also ameliorate parental stress. Family-based services that include both mothers and fathers would lead to better outcomes for all family members.",

        "abstract": "Although previous research supports the notion that characteristics of both the child and the mother impact maternal well-being and parenting stress in mothers of children with FXS, more work is needed in which self-report measures are supplemented by physiological measures of stress and well-being. The inclusion of physiological measures, such as heart rate variability (HRV), may provide a window into the biological origins and consequences of maternal perceptions of their experiences, including the challenges of raising a child with developmental challenges. The proposed project, therefore, involved the collection of multimodal assessment data from mothers and their school-aged children with FXS. Further, given the importance of understanding how mothers of youth with FXS are faring in their everyday environment, the present study collected all data using telehealth procedures and wearable technology. Participants were 20 biological mothers and their children with FXS between the ages of 6 and 11 years. We measured maternal mental health and parenting stress through self-report as well as through HRV as a more objective measure of psychological well-being. We also examined the associations between these variables and child characteristics such as externalizing and internalizing behaviors as well as autism symptomatology. We found significant support for an elevated rate of depressive symptoms in the sample of mothers (35%) and some potential indicators for heightened rates of anxiety (15%) when compared to normed samples and rates in the general population. We also found that the mothers presented with an atypical HRV profile akin to those experiencing depression or chronic stress, although limitations of the present measure suggest the need for additional confirmatory research. Further, we found that child externalizing behaviors were the primary correlates of maternal well-being. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature regarding the unique challenges faced by these mother-child dyads and supports the importance of increasing the availability of services available to these mothers, not only for meeting the needs of their children's development and behavior, but in supporting their own well-being as well.",

RESULTS: The findings provide insights about the potential impact of cessation probabilities among cancer patients in SCPs and the potential impact of SCPs on cancer patients' lives.

The utilization of \"real-world\" data allows these analyses to better reflect differences in costs and effects for actual patient populations with comorbidities and a range of ages as opposed to randomized controlled trials, which use a restricted population. This rapid review was done through PubMed and Google Scholar in July 2022. Relevant articles were summarized and data extracted to summarize changes in costs (in 2022 CAD) and effectiveness in cancer care once funded by the Canadian government payer system. We conducted statistical analyses to examine the differences between means and medians of costs, effects, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Twenty-two studies were selected for review. Of those, the majority performed a CE Analysis on cancer drugs. Real-world cancer drug studies had significantly higher costs and effects than non-drug therapies. Studies that utilized a model to project longer time-horizons saw significantly smaller ICER values for the treatments they examined. Further, differences in drug costs increased over time. This review highlights the importance of performing real-world CE Analysis on cancer treatments to better understand their costs and impacts on a general patient population.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety contribute to an estimated 74.6 million years of life with disability, and 80% of this burden occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where there is a large gap in care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically synthesize available evidence and quantify the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions in reducing depression and anxiety in LMICs. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases from the inception date to February 2022. We included randomized controlled trials conducted in LMICs that compared groups that received digital health interventions with controls (active control, treatment as usual, or no intervention) on depression or anxiety symptoms. Two reviewers independently extracted summary data reported in the papers and performed study quality assessments. The outcomes were postintervention measures of depression or anxiety symptoms (Hedges g). We calculated the pooled effect size weighted by inverse variance. RESULTS: Among 11,196 retrieved records, we included 80 studies in the meta-analysis (12,070 participants n=6052, 50.14% in the intervention group and n=6018, 49.85% in the control group) and 96 studies in the systematic review. The pooled effect sizes were -0.61 (95% CI -0.78 to -0.44; n=67 comparisons) for depression and -0.73 (95% CI -0.93 to -0.53; n=65 comparisons) for anxiety, indicating that digital health intervention groups had lower postintervention depression and anxiety symptoms compared with controls. Although heterogeneity was considerable (I2=0.94 for depression and 0.95 for anxiety), we found notable sources of variability between the studies, including intervention content, depression or anxiety symptom severity, control type, and age. Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluation showed that the evidence quality was overall high. CONCLUSIONS: Digital mental health tools are moderately to highly effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in LMICs. Thus, they could be effective options to close the gap in depression and anxiety care in LMICs, where the usual mental health care is minimal.

This mixed-method study evaluated a smart home technology intervention for individuals within this population as well as providing health care providers with health monitoring capabilities. The study recruited 13 participants who were offered a smartphone, a touchscreen monitor, and health devices, including smartwatches, weigh scales, and automated medication dispensers. Healthcare providers were able to track health device data, which were synchronized with the Lawson Integrated DataBase. Participants completed interviews at baseline as well as at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Focus groups with participants and care providers were conducted separately at 6-month and 12-month time points. As the sample size was too small for meaningful statistical inference, only descriptive statistics were presented. However, the qualitative analyses revealed improvements in physical and mental health, as well as enhanced communication with care providers and friends/family. Technical difficulties and considerations are addressed. Ethics analyses revealed advancement in equity and fairness, while policy analyses revealed plentiful opportunities for informing policymakers. The economic costs are also discussed. Further studies and technological interventions are recommended to explore and expand upon in-home technologies that can be easily implemented into the living environment.",

        "abstract": "The deep sea contains a surprising diversity of life, including iconic fish groups such as anglerfishes and lanternfishes. Still, >65% of marine teleost fish species are restricted to the photic zone <200 m, which comprises less than 10% of the ocean's total volume. From a macroevolutionary perspective, this paradox may be explained by three hypotheses: 1) shallow water lineages have had more time to diversify than deep-sea lineages, 2) shallow water lineages have faster rates of speciation than deep-sea lineages, or 3) shallow-to-deep sea transition rates limit deep-sea richness. Here we use phylogenetic comparative methods to test among these three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. While we found support for all hypotheses, the disparity in species richness is better described as the uneven outcome of alternating phases that favored shallow or deep diversification over the past 200 million y. Shallow marine teleosts became incredibly diverse 100 million y ago during a period of warm temperatures and high sea level, suggesting the importance of reefs and epicontinental settings. Conversely, deep-sea colonization and speciation was favored during brief episodes when cooling temperatures increased the efficiency of the ocean's carbon pump. Finally, time-variable ecological filters limited shallow-to-deep colonization for much of teleost history, which helped maintain higher shallow richness. A pelagic lifestyle and large jaws were associated with early deep-sea colonists, while a demersal lifestyle and a tapered body plan were typical of later colonists. Therefore, we also suggest that some hallmark characteristics of deep-sea fishes evolved prior to colonizing the deep sea.",

        "abstract": "It is widely believed that because of biomechanical trade-offs, fish body shape and the mode of propulsion are strong predictors of swimming performance, with the best cruisers, maneuverers and accelerators having different body forms and emphasizing different propulsion mechanisms. This paradigm is regularly projected onto routine swimming behaviour and dominates the ecomorphological literature, despite the paucity of field measurements. In this study, we measured variation in swimming behaviour among 48 species of Indian Ocean coral reef fishes using recordings from a remote stereo video system. We measured average swimming speed, average swimming bout distance, frequency of turns and percent of time spent station-holding and looked for the predicted trade-offs between them. We find little evidence of the expected relationships between swimming behaviours across species, little evidence that body shape affects swimming and few differences between species that swim by undulating the body and those that emphasize the use of median and paired fins. Taxa widely thought of as archetypical maneuverers (Chaetodon) and cruisers (Caranx) were not outliers in any behaviours. Our results indicate that swimming behaviour is not easily predicted from simple measures of body shape and that alternative swimming modes can produce comparable behavioural profiles.

        "abstract": "The diversity of fishes on coral reefs is influenced by the evolution of feeding innovations. For instance, the evolution of an intramandibular jaw joint has aided shifts to corallivory in Chaetodon butterflyfishes following their Miocene colonization of coral reefs. Today, over half of all Chaetodon species consume coral, easily the largest concentration of corallivores in any reef fish family. In contrast with Chaetodon, other chaetodontids, including the long-jawed bannerfishes, remain less intimately associated with coral and mainly consume other invertebrate prey. Here, we test (i) if intramandibular joint (IMJ) evolution in Chaetodon has accelerated feeding morphological diversification, and (ii) if cranial and post-cranial traits were affected similarly. We measured 19 cranial functional morphological traits, gut length and body elongation for 33 Indo-Pacific species. Comparisons of Brownian motion rate parameters revealed that cranial diversification was about four times slower in Chaetodon butterflyfishes with the IMJ than in other chaetodontids. However, the rate of gut length evolution was significantly faster in Chaetodon, with no group-differences for body elongation. The contrasting patterns of cranial and post-cranial morphological evolution stress the importance of comprehensive datasets in ecomorphology. The IMJ appears to enhance coral feeding ability in Chaetodon and represents a design breakthrough that facilitates this trophic strategy. Meanwhile, variation in gut anatomy probably reflects diversity in how coral tissues are procured and assimilated. Bannerfishes, by contrast, retain a relatively unspecialized gut for processing invertebrate prey, but have evolved some of the most extreme cranial mechanical innovations among bony fishes for procuring elusive prey.",

        "abstract": "Tetraodontiform fishes are characterized by jaws specialized for powerful biting and a diet dominated by hard-shelled prey. Strong biting by the oral jaws is an unusual feature among teleosts. We present a functional morphological analysis of the feeding mechanism of a representative tetraodontiform, Balistes vetula. As is typical for the order, long, sharp, strong teeth are mounted on the short, robust jaw bones of B. vetula. The neurocranium and suspensorium are enlarged and strengthened to serve as sites of attachment for the greatly hypertrophied adductor mandibulae muscles. Electromyographic recordings made from 11 cranial muscles during feeding revealed four distinct behaviors in the feeding repertoire of B. vetula. Suction is used effectively to capture soft prey and is associated with a motor pattern similar to that reported for many other teleosts. However, when feeding on hard prey, B. vetula directly bit the prey, exhibiting a motor pattern very different from that of suction feeding. During buccal manipulation, repeated cycles of jaw opening and closing (biting) were coupled with rapid movement of the prey in and out of the mouth. Muscle activity during buccal manipulation was similar to that seen during bite-captures. A blowing behavior was periodically employed during prey handling, as prey were forcefully \"spit out\" from the mouth, either to reposition them or to separate unwanted material from flesh. The motor pattern used during blowing was distinct from similar behaviors described for other fishes, indicating that this behaviors may be unique to tetraodontiforms. Thus B. vetula combines primitive behaviors and motor patterns (suction feeding and buccal manipulation) with specialized morphology (strong teeth, robust jaws, and hypertrophied adductor muscles) and a novel behavior (blowing) to exploit armored prey such as sea urchins molluscs, and crabs. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Ecomorphological analyses that search for patterns of association between morphological and prey-use data sets will have a greater chance of understanding the causal relationships between form and diet if the morphological variables used have known consequences for feeding performance. We explore the utility of fish body size, mouth gape and jaw-lever mechanics in predicting patterns of prey use in two very different communities of fishes, Caribbean coral reef fishes, and species of the Centrarchidae that live in Lake Opinicon, Ontario. In spite of major differences in the spectrum of potential prey available, the centrarchids of Lake Opinicon show dietary transitions during ontogeny that are very similar to those seen among and within species of Caribbean groupers (Serranidae). The transition from small zooplankton to intermediate sized invertebrates and ultimately to fishes appears to be very general in ram-suction feeding fishes and is probably driven largely by the constraints of mouth size on prey capture ability. The jaw-lever systems for mouth opening and closing represent direct trade-offs for speed and force of jaw movement. The ratio of in-lever to out-lever in the opening system changes during ontogeny in bluegill, indicating that the mechanics and kinematics of jaw movement may change as well. Among 34 species of Caribbean reef fishes, biting species had jaw-closing ratios that favored force translation, while species that employ rapid-strike ram-suction had closing ratios that enhanced speed of closing and mouth opening ratios that favored a more rapid expansion of the mouth during the strike. We suggest that when prey are categorized into functional groups, reflecting the specific performance features that are important in capturing and handling them, and the differences among habitats in the available prey resource are taken into account, general patterns can be found in morphology-diet relations that cross phylogenetic boundaries. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

        "issued": "2022-09-28",
        "abstract": "Begomoviruses are members of the family Geminiviridae, a large and diverse group of plant viruses characterized by a small circular single-stranded DNA genome encapsidated in twinned quasi-icosahedral virions. Cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is particularly susceptible and is infected by >100 bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses worldwide. In Brazil, 25 tomato-infecting begomoviruses have been described, most of which are bipartite. Tomato mottle leaf curl virus (ToMoLCV) is one of the most important of these and was first described in the late 1990s but has not been fully characterized. Here, we show that ToMoLCV is a monopartite begomovirus with a genomic DNA similar in size and genome organization to those of DNA-A components of New World (NW) begomoviruses. Tomato plants agroinoculated with the cloned ToMoLCV genomic DNA developed typical tomato mottle leaf curl disease symptoms, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates and confirming the monopartite nature of the ToMoLCV genome. We further show that ToMoLCV is transmitted by whiteflies, but not mechanically. Phylogenetic analyses placed ToMoLCV in a distinct and strongly supported clade with other begomoviruses from northeastern Brazil, designated the ToMoLCV lineage. Genetic analyses of the complete sequences of 87 ToMoLCV isolates revealed substantial genetic diversity, including five strain groups and seven subpopulations, consistent with a long evolutionary history. Phylogeographic models generated with partial or complete sequences predicted that the ToMoLCV emerged in northeastern Brazil >700 years ago, diversifying locally and then spreading widely in the country. Thus, ToMoLCV emerged well before the introduction of MEAM1 whiteflies, suggesting that the evolution of NW monopartite begomoviruses was facilitated by local whitefly populations and the highly susceptible tomato host. IMPORTANCE Worldwide, diseases of tomato caused by whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses) cause substantial economic losses and a reliance on insecticides for management. Here, we describe the molecular and biological properties of tomato mottle leaf curl virus (ToMoLCV) from Brazil and establish that it is a NW monopartite begomovirus indigenous to northeastern Brazil. This answered a long-standing question regarding the genome of this virus, and it is part of an emerging group of these viruses in Latin America. This appears to be driven by widespread planting of the highly susceptible tomato and by local and exotic whiteflies. Our extensive phylogenetic studies placed ToMoLCV in a distinct strongly supported clade with other begomoviruses from northeastern Brazil and revealed new insights into the origin of Brazilian begomoviruses. The novel phylogeographic analysis indicated that ToMoLCV has had a long evolutionary history, emerging in northeastern Brazil >700 years ago. Finally, the tools used here (agroinoculation system and ToMoLCV-specific PCR test) and information on the biology of the virus (host range and whitefly transmission) will be useful in developing and implementing integrated pest management (IPM) programs targeting ToMoLCV.",

The most prevalent type was stunted and bushy plants with distorted, upcurled, and yellowed leaves, which were similar to those associated with curly top disease (CTD) caused by the beet curly top virus (BCTV). This beet leafhopper-vectored virus is endemic in California and can cause economic losses to processing tomato production. Using a multiplex PCR test, BCTV infection was detected in 89% of hemp samples with CTD-like symptoms from Fresno, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties. Other symptom types had low incidence of BCTV infection and were associated with other factors. Hemp plants in California were infected only with the mild-type strains, BCTV-CO and BCTV-Wor, and often in mixed infection (43% of samples).

        "abstract": "Genetic resistance to Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is present in most processing tomato cultivars grown in California. However, in 2016, a resistance-breaking (RB) isolate of TSWV was detected in three tomato production areas in Central California. To evaluate overwintering potential, weeds and crops were collected and tested for RB where the isolate had been confirmed in tomatoes the previous season in early in 2017 and 2018. Of the winter weeds and crops sampled in February and March, RB TSWV was detected in Sonchus oleraceus and in commercial lettuce. For comparison of relative susceptibility of processing tomato cultivars, entries in commercial cultivar trials through Central California were evaluated for disease incidence and severity. From 2019 to 2021, 18 trials were evaluated and rating from 27 entries were analyzed. The average percentages of TSWV-symptomatic plants differed among entries with 'BP13', 'SV8011TM', 'SVTM1082', 'UG29814', 'H1662' and 'BQ413' having significantly lower symptom incidence than the most highly impacted cultivars. From two to three commercial cultivar trials per year, each of four to eight representative cultivars were sampled and tested. In the trials evaluated, RB was detected in all Sw-5 cultivars as well as in the susceptible cultivars tested. Insecticide efficacy against the thrips vector of TSWV was compared in a 13 treatment, four replication trial in 2021. However, only a Verimark transplant treatment significantly reduced thrips densities, only for 15 days. Presence of RB in winter crops and weeds, and in non-Sw-5 tomatoes suggests that the isolate will persist in Central California. Since genetic resistance will not protect tomatoes from TSWV and insecticides are inconsistent and deliver marginal levels of control of the thrips vector, current management depends upon multiple strategies including selection of less susceptible cultivars in high risk areas, avoidance of known virus sources, destruction of hosts and weeds.",

        "abstract": "Of the 70 cases of classical biological control for the protection of nature found in our review, there were fewer projects against insect targets (21) than against invasive plants (49), in part, because many insect biological control projects were carried out against agricultural pests, while nearly all projects against plants targeted invasive plants in natural ecosystems. Of 21 insect projects, 81% (17) provided benefits to protection of biodiversity, while 48% (10) protected products harvested from natural systems, and 5% (1) preserved ecosystem services, with many projects contributing to more than one goal. In contrast, of the 49 projects against invasive plants, 98% (48) provided benefits to protection of biodiversity, while 47% (23) protected products, and 25% (12) preserved ecosystem services, again with many projects contributing to several goals. We classified projects into complete control (pest generally no longer important), partial control (control in some areas but not others), and \" in progress,\" for projects in development for which outcomes do not yet exist. For insects, of the 21 projects discussed, 62% (13) achieved complete control of the target pest, 19% (4) provided partial control, and 43% (9) are still in progress. By comparison, of the 49 invasive plant projects considered, 27% (13) achieved complete control, while 33% (16) provided partial control, and 49% (24) are still in progress. For both categories of pests, some projects' success ratings were scored twice when results varied by region. We found approximately twice as many projects directed against invasive plants than insects and that protection of biodiversity was the most frequent benefit of both insect and plant projects. Ecosystem service protection was provided in the fewest cases by either insect or plant biological control agents, but was more likely to be provided by projects directed against invasive plants, likely because of the strong effects plants exert on landscapes. Rates of complete success appeared to be higher for insect than plant targets (62% vs 27%), perhaps because most often herbivores gradually weaken, rather than outright kill, their hosts, which is not the case for natural enemies directed against pest insects. For both insect and plant biological control, nearly half of all projects reviewed were listed as currently in progress, suggesting that the use of biological control for the protection of wildlands is currently very active. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

This study examined the behavior and host selection of C. peregrinus attacking P. ficus. Adult parasitoids were fed a 0.1% solution of acridine orange, a DNA binding dye used to label C. peregrinus eggs. In a choice test, adult parasitoids were offered equal numbers of first through fourth instars of P. ficus and behavior of C. peregrinus was filmed and analyzed. Acridine orange labeled ova of the parasitoids found within mealybug hosts fluoresced green under fluorescence microscopy and presence of fluorescing eggs in hosts was used to determine oviposition events. A time budget prepared for C. peregrinus indicated that this parasitoid spent the majority of its time searching (71.64%) and grooming (15.06%). The average probing duration over all instars which led to oviposition from single visits was 4.93±0.62 s. A total of 35.51% of probes from all attacks led to ovipositions, whereas 33.72% of single visits to hosts resulted in ovipositions. Detection of fluorescing acridine orange labeled eggs showed all instars of P. ficus were acceptable for oviposition by C. peregrinus. There was a significant preference to probe second, third, and fourth instars rather than first instars of P. ficus. Host feeding was not observed for this parasitoid.",

The experimental diets evaluated were: (i) irradiated Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs; (ii) irradiated E. kuehniella eggs and avocado pollen; (iii) Tetranychus pacificus McGregor eggs; (iv) T. pacificus eggs and avocado pollen; (v) irradiated E. kuehniella eggs and T. pacificus eggs; (vi) irradiated E. kuehniella eggs, T. pacificus eggs and avocado pollen; (vii) Scirtothrips perseae; (viii) Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis (Bouchè); (ix) avocado pollen; and (x) a young avocado leaf. Franklinothrips orizabensis larvae were unable to develop to adulthood on diets 9 and 10. The remaining eight diets supported complete development of F. orizabensis, but only diets 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 produced fecund females. On diet 5, F. orizabensis exhibited high larval to adult survivorship (90%), mated females exhibited highest daily and lifetime fecundity, and the progeny of mated females were female biased (53%). Analysis of jackknife estimates of net reproduction (Ro), intrinsic rate of increase (rm), and finite rate of increase (lambda) were all significantly greater for F. orizabensis reared on irradiated E. kuehniella eggs and T. pacificus eggs (i.e. diet 5) than corresponding values for other diets on which female F. orizabensis were able to complete development and reproduce. Incorporation of avocado pollen into diets had an adverse effect on demographic statistics for F. orizabensis, and low quality diets resulted in male biased sex ratios for this predator.",

        "abstract": "The developmental and reproductive biology of a new species of predatory Franklinothrips was determined in the laboratory at three constant temperatures. At the intermediate experimental temperature (25°C), Franklinothrips n. sp. exhibited the greatest larval to adult survivorship, and mated females produced more progeny of which a greater proportion were female when compared to individuals reared at 20 and 30°C. Analysis of jackknife estimates of net reproduction (R(o)), generation times (T(c)), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), and finite rate of increase (λ) were all significantly greater at 25°C than corresponding values at 20 and 30°C. Population doubling time (T(d)) was significantly lower at 25°C, indicating that population growth is approximately 50% faster at this temperature than at 20 and 30°C. Unmated female Franklinothrips n. sp. produce only male offspring, confirming arrhenotoky in this species. At 30°C, 15% of larvae failed to produce silk pupation cocoons and propupal and pupal stages were observed for cocoonless individuals. This result indicates that Franklinothrips n. sp. has two pupal stages, contradicting earlier speculations about the pupal biology of this genus. Furthermore, at 30°C, 13% of mated females and 33% of unmated females failed to produce viable eggs when reared and maintained at this temperature. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",

Mean time from egg oviposition to adult death and mean female adult longevity was greatest at 25°C. Mean total progeny production was greatest at 25°C at 214 eggs per individual. The percentage of females ovipositing at each experimental temperature was relatively low at 22, 46, and 56% at 20, 25, and 30°C, respectively. No oviposition occurred at 33°C. Upper, lower, and optimal developmental thresholds were calculated for all life stages, and for egg to adult emergence these were 35.95, 13.99, and 29.45°C, respectively. Key demographic parameters were calculated and intrinsic rate of increase and net reproductive rate were highest at 30 and 25°Cat 0.04 and 40.21 d, respectively.Meangeneration times and population doubling times were lowest at 25 (97.66 d) and 30°C (15.51 d). Modeling of demographic parameters indicated that approximately three generations of H. vitripennis per year are needed for the existence of permanent populations. Historical weather data were used to map the number of generations and estimate net reproductive rates for H. vitripennis throughout California.

        "abstract": "A key advantage of polarizable force fields is their ability to model the atomic polarization effects that play key roles in the atomic many-body interactions. In this work, we assessed the accuracy of the recently developed polarizable Gaussian Multipole (pGM) models in reproducing quantum mechanical (QM) interaction energies, many-body interaction energies, as well as the nonadditive and additive contributions to the many-body interactions for peptide main-chain hydrogen-bonding conformers, using glycine dipeptide oligomers as the model systems. Two types of pGM models were considered, including that with (pGM-perm) and without (pGM-ind) permanent atomic dipoles. The performances of the pGM models were compared with several widely used force fields, including two polarizable (Amoeba13 and ff12pol) and three additive (ff19SB, ff15ipq, and ff03) force fields. Encouragingly, the pGM models outperform all other force fields in terms of reproducing QM interaction energies, many-body interaction energies, as well as the nonadditive and additive contributions to the many-body interactions, as measured by the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) and mean absolute errors (MAEs). Furthermore, we tested the robustness of the pGM models against polarizability parameterization errors by employing alternative polarizabilities that are either scaled or obtained from other force fields. The results show that the pGM models with alternative polarizabilities exhibit improved accuracy in reproducing QM many-body interaction energies as well as the nonadditive and additive contributions compared with other polarizable force fields, suggesting that the pGM models are robust against the errors in polarizability parameterizations. This work shows that the pGM models are capable of accurately modeling polarization effects and have the potential to serve as templates for developing next-generation polarizable force fields for modeling various biological systems.",

        "abstract": "Accuracy and transferability are the two highly desirable properties of molecular mechanical force fields. Compared with the extensively used point-charge additive force fields that apply fixed atom-centered point partial charges to model electrostatic interactions, polarizable force fields are thought to have the advantage of modeling the atomic polarization effects. Previous works have demonstrated the accuracy of the recently developed polarizable Gaussian multipole (pGM) models. In this work, we assessed the transferability of the electrostatic parameters of the pGM models with (pGM-perm) and without (pGM-ind) atomic permanent dipoles in terms of reproducing the electrostatic potentials surrounding molecules/oligomers absent from electrostatic parameterizations. Encouragingly, both the pGM-perm and pGM-ind models show significantly improved transferability than the additive model in the tests (1) from water monomer to water oligomer clusters; (2) across different conformations of amino acid dipeptides and tetrapeptides; (3) from amino acid tetrapeptides to longer polypeptides; and (4) from nucleobase monomers to Watson-Crick base pair dimers and tetramers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the double-conformation fittings using amino acid tetrapeptides in the αR and β conformations can result in good transferability not only across different tetrapeptide conformations but also from tetrapeptides to polypeptides with lengths ranging from 1 to 20 repetitive residues for both the pGM-ind and pGM-perm models. In addition, the observation that the pGM-ind model has significantly better accuracy and transferability than the point-charge additive model, even though they have an identical number of parameters, strongly suggest the importance of intramolecular polarization effects. In summary, this and previous works together show that the pGM models possess both accuracy and transferability, which are expected to serve as foundations for the development of next-generation polarizable force fields for modeling various polarization-sensitive biological systems and processes.",

This study identifies error outliers as the primary factor causing this failure of energy conservation and proposes a comprehensive scheme to overcome this limitation. Leveraging maximum relative errors as a convergence metric, our data demonstrates that energy conservation can be upheld even when using historical information for dipole predictions. Our study introduces the multi-order extrapolation method to quicken induction iteration and optimize the use of historical data, while also developing the preconditioned conjugate gradient with local iterations to refine the iteration process and effectively remove error outliers. This scheme further incorporates a \"peek\" step via Jacobi under-relaxation for optimal performance. Simulation evidence suggests that our proposed scheme can achieve energy convergence akin to that of point-charge models within a limited number of iterations, thus promising significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Accurate characterization of electrostatic interactions is crucial in molecular simulation. Various methods and programs have been developed to obtain electrostatic parameters for additive or polarizable models to replicate electrostatic properties obtained from experimental measurements or theoretical calculations. Electrostatic potentials (ESPs), a set of physically well-defined observables from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, are well suited for optimization efforts due to the ease of collecting a large amount of conformation-dependent data. However, a reliable set of QM ESP computed at an appropriate level of theory and atomic basis set is necessary. In addition, despite the recent development of the PyRESP program for electrostatic parameterizations of induced dipole-polarizable models, the time-consuming and error-prone input file preparation process has limited the widespread use of these protocols. This work aims to comprehensively evaluate the quality of QM ESPs derived by eight methods, including wave function methods such as Hartree-Fock (HF), second-order Møller-Plesset (MP2), and coupled cluster-singles and doubles (CCSD), as well as five hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, used in conjunction with 13 different basis sets. The highest theory levels CCSD/aug-cc-pV5Z (a5z) and MP2/aug-cc-pV5Z (a5z) were selected as benchmark data over two homemade data sets. The results show that the hybrid DFT method, ωB97X-D, combined with the aug-cc-pVTZ (a3z) basis set, performs well in reproducing ESPs while taking both accuracy and efficiency into consideration. Moreover, a flexible and user-friendly program called PyRESP_GEN was developed to streamline input file preparation. The restraining strengths, along with strategies for polarizable Gaussian multipole (pGM) model parameterizations, were also optimized. These findings and the program presented in this work facilitate the development and application of induced dipole-polarizable models, such as pGM models, for molecular simulations of both chemical and biological significance.",

        "abstract": "Accurate parametrization of amino acids is pivotal for the development of reliable force fields for molecular modeling of biomolecules such as proteins. This study aims to assess amino acid electrostatic parametrizations with the polarizable Gaussian Multipole (pGM) model by evaluating the performance of the pGM-perm (with atomic permanent dipoles) and pGM-ind (without atomic permanent dipoles) variants compared to the traditional RESP model. The 100-conf-combterm fitting strategy on tetrapeptides was adopted, in which (1) all peptide bond atoms (-CO-NH-) share identical set of parameters and (2) the total charges of the two terminal N-acetyl (ACE) and N-methylamide (NME) groups were set to neutral. The accuracy and transferability of electrostatic parameters across peptides with varying lengths and real-world examples were examined. The results demonstrate the enhanced performance of the pGM-perm model in accurately representing the electrostatic properties of amino acids. This insight underscores the potential of the pGM-perm model and the 100-conf-combterm strategy for the future development of the pGM force field.",

        "abstract": "In the current walnut drying practice, dryers comingle nuts with varying moisture contents (MC) which results in over-drying of nuts with low MC and thereby decrease product quality. The objectives of this research were to investigate correlations among near infrared (NIR) spectral data and MC of freshly harvested in-shell walnuts and determine the feasibility of using NIR spectroscopic sorting of walnuts to minimize moisture variability in individual nuts within each batch introduced into dryers. NIR transmission spectra of in-shell walnuts of Chandler variety with MCs ranging from 10% to 70% wet basis were determined. Partial least square regression (PLS-R) of the spectral data was performed to establish the correlations among the spectral data and walnut MC. Model validation was also performed to establish the accuracy of MC prediction. The results revealed that there was a strong linear relationship between walnut shell MC and whole nut (R2 = 0.968) and walnut shell MC and kernel MC (R2= 0.851). The wavelengths at which peak NIR transmission intensity occurred were between 820 and 910 nm. The higher the concentration of moisture in the nut, the lower the NIR transmission value would be. Also, there was a spatial variation in individual nut surface transmission spectra. Model validation indicated that five partial least square (PLS) latent variables were adequate to explain 98% of response variation (MC) and also provided the simplest model with a predicted residual error sum of square (PRESS) statistic of 0.751, which was not significantly different from the absolute minimum PRESS value of 0.744. Predicted and observed MC of walnuts agreed with R2 of 0.978. The results are vital for developing new MC-based sorting methods for walnut using NIR to improve drying efficiency and product quality.",

        "abstract": "To improve the processing performance of infrared dry peeling of tomatoes, a three-dimensional heat transfer model for infrared radiant heating was established. This model was used to predict the temperatures for different positions on the surface of and inside the tomato during infrared peeling, and the fitting effect was verified by comparing predicted values of temperature with the measured values. Furthermore, the energy consumption of two different infrared equipment was calculated, compared, and analyzed to select the ideal infrared equipment. The gas-roller conveying catalytic infrared equipment could rapidly heat the tomato skin (the highest surface temperature was 60.32 ℃) with a more uniform surface temperature distribution (the maximum temperature difference was approximately 6.44 ℃) when compared with the static catalytic infrared equipment. The increase in internal temperature was minimal (the highest internal temperature was 49.10 ℃), and the internal temperature distribution was relatively uniform (the maximum temperature difference was approximately 18.25 ℃). The predicted values of the model fitted well with the measured values (R2≥0.93), and the estimated standard error EESE value was low (0.13~10.80 ℃). These findings indicated that the three-dimensional heat transfer model showed a good fitting effect, reflecting the temperature distribution on the surface of andinside the tomato under different infrared equipment. Moreover, the gas-roller conveying catalytic infrared equipment was superior to the static catalytic infrared equipment, given the higher efficiency and energy-saving afforded by reducing the processing time by 16.60% and saving 34.80% of energy consumption. This method could have broad application prospects and industrial value in the field of fruit and vegetable peeling.",

Moreover, a mathematical model between the proportion of the moisture lateral relaxation peak area and the actual moisture content was established. The results showed that the changing trend of the drying curve under the three drying methods was the same. Compared with the single hot air drying [duration 20 h, maximum drying rate 0.11 g/(g•min)], the variable temperature and constant temperature drum catalytic infrared-hot air drying efficiencies [drying times of 14.38 h and 16.16 h, maximum drying rates of 0.28 g/(g•min) and 0.48 g/(g•min)] were significantly increased, the drying times were shortened by 28.10% and 19.20% respectively, and the maximum drying rates were increased by 2.55 and 4.36 times respectively, indicating that the catalytic infrared drying treatment significantly improved drying effectiveness. The LF-NMR transverse relaxation map showed that the free water peak area decreased significantly during the drying process until it disappeared, the weakly bound water peak area was significantly reduced, and the strongly bound water and oil peak areas remained basically unchanged, indicating that the drying process removed almost all the free water and most of the weakly bound water and had no obvious effects on the strongly bound water and oil contents. A mathematical model between the proportion of the moisture relaxation peak area and the actual moisture content was established. R2 was greater than 0.90, and the prediction effect was good. In general, compared with the national standard method, LF-NMR can detect the change of moisture and oil during the drying process very well, and it was a new method for efficient and rapid detection of moisture content.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop a simultaneous drying and disinfection method for off-ground harvested almonds to improve drying energy efficiency and product safety. Drying experiments were conducted in a column dryer (0.57 m height) under constant temperature hot air heating (ambient, 40, 50 and 60°C) or step-down temperature heating conditions (preheating with 80°C and 90°C) with holding for 1, 2 and 3 h, and then finishing drying at 60°C at an air velocity of 1.0 m/s. The drying time ranged from 4 to 36 hours to dry almonds from their initial moisture content of 0.41 kg water/kg wet mass to a targeted 0.12 kg water/kg wet mass almond moisture. For quality, no cavity, significant color change, significant concealed damage and deterioration of oil quality were observed under all tested conditions. The specific energy consumption ranged from 14.3 to 22.0 MJ/kg under the test conditions. The step-down temperature hot air drying with holding achieved up to 0.8 log CFU/g reduction in the total bacterial counts of in-shell almonds. Drying in-shell almonds saved 75% drying time and 10% energy consumption compared to drying in-hull almonds under the same temperature with more uniform final moisture distribution. The findings suggested that offground harvested almonds should be sorted and de-hulled prior to drying, which could significantly improve the drying efficiency, moisture uniformity and throughput of the drying process.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the drying efficiency of hard shell nuts, this work developed a new type of multi-unit drum-type catalytic infrared drying equipment with a variable temperature, and adopted a combined drying technology of drum catalytic infrared with a variable temperature and hot air. In this work, the walnut drying effect, energy consumption and kinetic process were studied. The results showed that the catalytic infrared temperature, radiation distance, and rotating speed of the drum all had significant effects on the drying performance. After 22.50 min of infrared radiation pre-drying under the optimal radiation temperature of 300+400 ℃, radiation distance of 30 cm and rotation speed of 25+35+35 Hz, and then 14 h of hot air drying under the temperature of 43 ℃ and speed of 3 m/s, the total drying time was 14.38 h. Compared with that of single hot air drying, the drying time was shortened by 28.10% and the energy consumption was saved 25.04%. The dried walnut shell had no brown spots, the shell opening rate was 0%, the L value was 54.24, the a value was 10.61, the b value was 19.89 and the color was bright red and yellow. In addition, the maximum drying rate (0.28 g/g•min) was significantly higher than that of the single hot air drying (0.11 g/g•min). Correspondingly, the Henderson-Pabis model established can well predict the changes of water content and drying rate of walnut in the drying process and the fitting effect was good with R2 of 0.99 and RMSE of 0.03. Therefore, the combined drying technology of drum catalytic infrared with a variable temperature and hot air is a kind of new type drying method with high efficiency and energy saving, suitable for drying nuts products.",

        "abstract": "Detailed textural and geochemical analyses of the carbonaceous achondrites Northwest Africa (NWA) 7680 and NWA 6962 support a rapid progression of thermal events, by similar processes, on the same parent body. The achondrites have olivine compositions of Fa44.8 and Fa47.4 for NWA 7680 and NWA 6962, respectively. Replicate oxygen isotope analyses of grains and bulk powders from NWA 7680 yielded average Δ17O values of −1.04 ± 0.03‰ and −1.00 ± 0.05‰, respectively, which is identical to that reported for NWA 6962. The whole rock ɛ54Cr compositions are also equivalent for NWA 7680 and NWA 6962 (1.36 ± 0.05 and 1.30 ± 0.05, respectively). Both meteorites are plagioclase-rich, and NWA 7680 is also Fe-metal-rich, suggesting they both formed via differentiation processes that resulted in the pooling of partial melt products. Major element geochemical trends show that both rocks could be formed through the melting of chondritic material on a CR chondrite-like parent body. This is consistent with oxygen isotope and chromium isotope compositions. Intrusion of a late-stage melt is evident in both meteorites and the crystallization products include silica-rich, alkali-deficient nepheline. The late-stage liquid has partially melted and mixed with primary plagioclase in NWA 6962. In contrast, the late-stage liquid was often restricted to grain boundaries in NWA 7680, leaving some of the primary plagioclase crystals intact. In situ dating of NWA 7680 phosphate minerals (merrillite and fluorapatite) reveals that it has not experienced long duration thermal metamorphism, or impact-related Pb loss and age resetting since 4578 ± 17 Ma (207Pb/206Pb age ± 2σ, within error of solar system age). Phosphates associated with the late-stage melt in NWA 6962 yield a 207Pb/206Pb age of 4556.6 ± 8.0 Ma (2σ) within 2σ of the NWA 7680 age. These early dates indicate that the observed chromium isotope signatures in these meteorites were not introduced by a later high-temperature event, such as late impact accretion processes. These data are consistent with a rapid separation of inner and outer solar system chemical reservoirs, planetesimal melting, differentiation, and cooling, all within several million years of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion formation.",

        "abstract": "We have conducted a NanoSIMS-based search for presolar material in samples recently returned from C-type asteroid Ryugu as part of JAXA's Hayabusa2 mission. We report the detection of all major presolar grain types with O- and C-anomalous isotopic compositions typically identified in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites: 1 silicate, 1 oxide, 1 O-anomalous supernova grain of ambiguous phase, 38 SiC, and 16 carbonaceous grains. At least two of the carbonaceous grains are presolar graphites, whereas several grains with moderate C isotopic anomalies are probably organics. The presolar silicate was located in a clast with a less altered lithology than the typical extensively aqueously altered Ryugu matrix. The matrix-normalized presolar grain abundances in Ryugu are 4.8 − 2.6 + 4.7 ppm for O-anomalous grains, 25 − 5 + 6 ppm for SiC grains, and 11 − 3 + 5 ppm for carbonaceous grains. Ryugu is isotopically and petrologically similar to carbonaceous Ivuna-type (CI) chondrites. To compare the in situ presolar grain abundances of Ryugu with CI chondrites, we also mapped Ivuna and Orgueil samples and found a total of 15 SiC grains and 6 carbonaceous grains. No O-anomalous grains were detected. The matrix-normalized presolar grain abundances in the CI chondrites are similar to those in Ryugu: 23 − 6 + 7 ppm SiC and 9.0 − 3.6 + 5.4 ppm carbonaceous grains. Thus, our results provide further evidence in support of the Ryugu-CI connection. They also reveal intriguing hints of small-scale heterogeneities in the Ryugu samples, such as locally distinct degrees of alteration that allowed the preservation of delicate presolar material.",

Here, we show that samples returned from Cb-type asteroid Ryugu have Fe isotopic anomalies indistinguishable from Ivuna-type (CI) chondrites, which are distinct from all other carbonaceous chondrites. Iron isotopes, therefore, demonstrate that Ryugu and CI chondrites formed in a reservoir that was different from the source regions of other carbonaceous asteroids. Growth and migration of the giant planets destabilized nearby planetesimals and ejected some inward to be implanted into the Main Belt. In this framework, most carbonaceous chondrites may have originated from regions around the birthplaces of Jupiter and Saturn, while the distinct isotopic composition of CI chondrites and Ryugu may reflect their formation further away in the disk, owing their presence in the inner Solar System to excitation by Uranus and Neptune.",

Here, we show that high-temperature anhydrous primary minerals in Ryugu and CI chondrites exhibit a bimodal distribution of oxygen isotopic compositions: 16O-rich (associated with refractory inclusions) and 16O-poor (associated with chondrules). Both the 16O-rich and 16O-poor minerals probably formed in the inner solar protoplanetary disk and were subsequently transported outward. The abundance ratios of the 16O-rich to 16O-poor minerals in Ryugu and CI chondrites are higher than in other carbonaceous chondrite groups but are similar to that of comet 81P/Wild2, suggesting that Ryugu and CI chondrites accreted in the outer Solar System closer to the accretion region of comets.",

        "abstract": "Shidian is a recent meteorite which fell in Yunnan province, China, on November 27, 2017, and has been classified as a CM2 chondrite. Petrography, mineralogy, oxygen and chromium isotopic composition, reflectance spectrum, and density studies of Shidian are reported in this study. Clasts with different aqueous alteration degree, two type 1 clasts with nontypical CM petrography, and one metamorphic clast are observed in Shidian. Mineralogically, Shidian main body consists of phyllosilicates (∼70 vol%), forsterite (∼13 vol%), fayalitic olivine, carbonates, sulfide, high-Ca pyroxene, magnetite framboids, and Fe-Ni metal. The average electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) analytical totals of phyllosilicates are 84.07 ± 1.75 wt%, with average FeO/SiO2 of tochilinite–cronstedtite intergrowths (TCIs) in different clasts ranging from 1.18 to 3.29. The bulk geochemical composition is characterized by flat rare earth element pattern, and by depletion of highly volatile elements. The whole rock oxygen isotopic composition is −0.51 ± 0.73‰, 5.44 ± 1.01‰, and −3.38 ± 0.20‰ for δ17O, δ18O, and Δ17O, respectively, with bulk chromium isotopic composition as ε54Cr = 1.00 ± 0.11. The grain density, bulk density, and porosity are 2.758 ± 0.008 g cm−3, 2.500 ± 0.004 g cm−3, and 9.37 ± 0.59%, respectively. The reflectance spectrum shows “blue” (negative) continuum slope across the visible and near-infrared range, with characteristic absorption features (such as 0.765, 0.923, and 1.160 μm for phyllosilicates). These characteristics indicate that Shidian is an unheated, brecciated CM chondrite and may be an analog of asteroid Bennu.",

Many of these countries currently have limited capacity to provide necessary brachytherapy treatment. To bridge this gap in LMICs in North Africa and the Middle East, nonprofits Rayos Contra Cancer and Radiating Hope evaluated the efficacy, cost, and feasibility of a pilot HDR brachytherapy continuing medical education curriculum to selected regional cancer centers via videoconferencing. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>METHODS</jats:title><jats:p> Rayos Contra Cancer and Radiating Hope recruited a global team of HDR brachytherapy content experts. They developed a 16-week curriculum and recruited 10 regional cancer center partners in LMICs throughout the Middle East, Africa, and Nepal. The curriculum included 17 sessions shared via live Zoom videoconferences. A lead correspondent was assigned for communication at each center. Attendance was taken during each call, and pre- and postsession Likert-scale (1 to 5 points) surveys were collected from participants that assessed their confidence in 15 practical competencies in HDR brachytherapy and overall confidence in their ability to provide services and teach others. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p> A total of 326 attendance hours was recorded during the curriculum. Among 46 participants, the average paired confidence scores increased pre- versus postcurriculum in all 15 practical competencies, with an average improvement of 1.2 out of 5 and significant P values in all 15 topics. Absolute improvements were largest for confidence in applicator commissioning (2.3 to 3.8, P = .0015), TPS commissioning (2.2 to 3.7, P = .0010), and commissioning an HDR machine (2.2 to 4.0, P = .00096). Participant confidence significantly increased in ability to provide services (3.5 to 4.2, P = .0023) and teach others (3.4 to 3.9, P = .013). There was no cost to provide this training, and more than 4,300 patients are treated annually with HDR brachytherapy at participating centers. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title><jats:p> This novel low-cost telehealth model for HDR brachytherapy training is a promising vehicle for advancing cancer care in LMICs. Postcourse surveys demonstrated increased confidence in both providing care and teaching in HDR brachytherapy, and sessions were well attended.

        "abstract": "Scattering amplitudes are both a wonderful playground to discover novel ideas in quantum field theory and simultaneously of immense phenomenological importance to make precision predictions for e.g. particle collider observables and more recently also for gravitational wave signals. In this review chapter, we give an overview of some of the exciting recent progress on reformulating QFT in terms of mathematical, geometric quantities, such as polytopes, associahedra, Grassmanians, and the amplituhedron. In this novel approach, standard notions of locality and unitarity are derived concepts rather than fundamental ingredients in the construction which might give us a handle on a number of open questions in QFT that have evaded an answer for decades. We first give a basic summary of positive geometry before discussing the associahedron—one of the simplest physically relevant geometric examples—and its relation to tree-level scattering amplitudes in bi-adjoint ϕ 3 theory. Our second example is the amplituhedron construction for scattering amplitudes in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study non-adjacent BCFW recursion relations and their connection to positive geometry. For an adjacent BCFW shift, the n-point NkMHV tree-level amplitude in N = 4 SYM theory is expressed as a sum over planar on-shell diagrams, corresponding to canonical “dlog” forms on the cells in the positive Grassmannian G+(k, n). Non-adjacent BCFW shifts naturally lead to an expansion of the amplitude in terms of a different set of objects, which do not manifest the cyclic ordering and the hidden Yangian symmetry of the amplitude. We show that these terms can be interpreted as dlog forms on the non-planar Grassmannian geometries, generalizing the cells of the positive Grassmannian G+(k, n) to a larger class of objects which live in G(k, n). We focus mainly on the case of NMHV amplitudes and discuss in detail the Grassmannian geometries. We also propose an alternative way to calculate the associated on-shell functions and dlog forms using an intriguing connection between Grassmannian configurations and the geometry in the kinematical space.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we study on-shell diagrams in N < 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. These are on-shell gauge invariant objects which appear as cuts of loop integrands in the context of generalized unitarity and serve as building blocks for amplitudes in recursion relations. In the dual formulation, they are associated with cells of the positive Grassmannian G+(k, n) and the on-shell functions can be reproduced as canonical differential forms. While for the case of the N = 4 maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory all poles in on-shell diagrams correspond to IR poles when the momentum flows in edges are zero, for N < 4 SYM theories there are new UV poles when the loop momenta go to infinity. These poles originate from the prefactor of the canonical dlog form and do not correspond to erasing edges in on-shell diagrams. We show that they can be interpreted as a diagrammatic operation which involves pinching a loop and performing a “non-planar twist” on external legs, which gives rise to a non-planar on-shell diagram. Our result provides an important clue on the role of poles at infinite momenta in on-shell scattering amplitudes, and the relation to non-planar on-shell functions.",

This generalizes the soft recursions for tree-level amplitudes in a variety of quantum field theories with special soft limits. The main ingredient is the definition of the one-loop planar integrand, which is fixed by cuts in the sense of generalized unitarity and by requiring the Adler zero on all external legs. We show that this does not uniquely fix the integrand, so additional constraints on the soft behavior of the loop momentum have to be imposed. Our work is the first step in extending modern amplitudes methods for loop amplitudes to effective field theories with special soft limits.",

We have successfully composted grass straw with a C:N of 50 to 1 using existing farm machinery and normal precipitation (115 cm y−1and occurs primarily between October and June). After turning and densification in the field, composting conditions were achieved with the rapid growth of thermophilic microorganisms. During laboratory incubations of the grass straw, bacteria ranged from 108-109g−1grass straw. Actinomycetes numbered 108g−1grass straw. Fungi ranged from 106-107propagules g−1grass straw. Microbial biomass C during composting represented four to six percent of total grass straw C. A significant amount of lignin C, 25 percent, was degraded during mesophilic decomposition while 39 percent was degraded during thermophilic decomposition. The acid insoluble lignin fraction became highly oxidized and accumulated N. The decomposed lignin C, N, H and O concentrations were similar to humic substances in soil. These data indicate that extensive lignin degradation occurred. A simulation of microbial production indicated that the microbial biomass was more efficient at mesophilic than at thermophilic temperatures. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "The decomposition of perennial ryegrass straw was examined under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures. Thermophilic conditions were used to define the composting process. The change in lipids, sugars, soluble polysaccharides, cellulose, and lignin was determined during a 45- day incubation. C, H, O, and N steadily decreased in both temperature treatments. The lignin content, as measured by the Klason or 72% H2SO4 method, decreased by 10% under mesophilic and 29% under thermophilic conditions. The Klason lignin C loss was 25 and 39% under mesophilic and thermophilic incubations, respectively. The changes in element (C, N, H, and O) ratios indicated that 94% of the lignin fraction was altered during both low- and high-temperature incubations. The changes in the lignin-like fraction as shown by elemental ratios were more extensive than those indicated by the Klason method, showing that this lignin determination has limited value in describing plant residue decomposition. The decomposition of the straw components and the concomitant degradation of the lignin fraction represent an important decomposition process that facilitates the composting of ryegrass straw with a high C:N ratio.",

        "abstract": "We studied whole-tree C allocation with special emphasis on the quantification of C allocation to roots and root respiration. To document seasonal patterns of C allocation, 2-year-old hybrid poplar trees greater than 3 m tall were labeled with (14)CO(2) in a large Plexiglas chamber in the field, in July and September. Climate and CO(2) concentration were controlled to track ambient conditions during labeling. Individual tree canopy CO(2) assimilation averaged 3.8 micromol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) (12.9 g C day(-1) tree(-1)) in July and 6.2 micromol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) (9.8 g C day(-1) tree(-1)) in September. Aboveground dark respiration was 12% of net daytime C fixation in July and 15% in September. Specific activity of root-soil respiration peaked 2 days after labeling and stabilized to less than 5% of maximum 2 weeks later. Low specific activity of root-soil respiration and a labeled pool of root C demonstrated that current photosynthate was the primary source of C for root growth and maintenance during the growing season. Root respiration averaged 20% of total soil respiration in both July and September based on the proportion of labeled C respired to labeled C fixed. In July, 80% of the recovered (14)C was found above ground and closely resembled the weight distribution of the growing shoot. By September, 51% of the recovered (14)C was in the root system and closely resembled the weight distribution of different size classes of roots. The finding that the distribution of biomass and (14)C were similar verified that the C introduced during labeling followed normal seasonal translocation pathways. Results are compared to smaller scale labeling studies and the suitability of the approach for studying long-term C fluxes is discussed.",

We developed a low-input method to compost perennial ryegrass straw on-farm by forming windrows and turning them either zero, two, four, or six times throughout the year with a commercial, straddle-type turner. No water beyond normal rainfall and no N other than that contained in the straw was added. The volume of straw was reduced by up to 88% with four or six turns over 20 to 24 weeks. The average internal temperature of straw windrows reached a maximum of 54°C with four turns. The ability to compost these residues will help in the development of sustainable farming systems by allowing recycling of straw waste.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the incidence of clinically important bleeding in children with superwarfarin rodenticide ingestions not treated with gastrointestinal decontamination or prophylactic vitamin K. METHODS: We prospectively studied patients younger than 6 years of age who reported to our poison center with acute unintentional superwarfarin ingestions. Patients who received gastrointestinal decontamination or prophylactic vitamin K were excluded. Forty-eight- to 96-hour prothrombin time or international normalized ratio (INR) blood tests were recommended, and telephone contact was attempted at least 3 days after ingestion. RESULTS: A total of 595 consecutive patients were enrolled during the 16-month study period. Fifty patients were excluded: 8 who were known to have ingested 1 pellet or less; 25 who received activated charcoal; 15 who were treated with induced emesis; and 2 who received prophylactic vitamin K. The resulting study group contained 545 patients. Eighty-two patients were lost to follow-up. Follow-up was obtained for 463 patients, including 222 by telephone contact alone, 62 by 48- to 96-hour INR, and 179 by both methods. None of the patients had clinically important coagulopathy. Two patients had an INR of 1.5 or greater (1.5 and 1.8) without symptoms. Single nosebleeds were reported in another 2 patients with normal 48-hour INRs. Another child had a small amount of blood crusted in the nose with no other symptoms and no laboratory work available. One child with a normal 48-hour INR had blood-streaked stools that were thought to be caused by an anal fissure. CONCLUSION: Children with acute unintentional superwarfarin ingestions of less than 1 box may be managed without gastric decontamination or prophylactic vitamin K. Laboratory testing for coagulopathy should be reserved for cases involving clinically evident bleeding abnormalities.",

There are many crucial roles within an RRS, although the optimal RRS team composition has yet to be determined. Numerous tools have been developed to aid in early recognition of at-risk patients, but much research is needed to define a standard. Individual examples of successful RRS have been published and can be modeled for widespread deployment, but each health system is unique, and further investigation is needed to understand how to implement them optimally.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 receptor antagonists can reduce mortality in septic shock patients with hepatobiliary dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (HBD + DIC), an organ failure pattern with inflammatory features consistent with macrophage activation. Identification of clinical phenotypes in sepsis may allow for improved care. We aim to describe the occurrence of HBD + DIC in a contemporary cohort of patients with sepsis and determine the association of this phenotype with known macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) biomarkers and mortality. We performed a retrospective nested case-control study in adult septic shock patients with concurrent HBD + DIC and an equal number of age-matched controls, with comparative analyses of all-cause mortality and circulating biomarkers between the groups. Multiple logistic regression explored the effect of HBD + DIC on mortality and the discriminatory power of the measured biomarkers for HBD + DIC and mortality. RESULTS: Six percent of septic shock patients (n = 82/1341) had HBD + DIC, which was an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-7.5, p = 0.008). Relative to sepsis controls, the HBD + DIC cohort had increased levels of 21 of the 26 biomarkers related to macrophage activation (p < 0.05). This panel was predictive of both HBD + DIC (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 84%) and mortality (sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 90%). CONCLUSION: The HBD + DIC phenotype identified patients with high mortality and a molecular signature resembling that of MAS. These observations suggest trials of MAS-directed therapies are warranted.",

Two hundred adult patients with mild to moderate oral overdoses were entered into the trial. Patients receiving only activated charcoal were discharged from the emergency department in significantly (P less than or equal to .05) less time than those receiving both syrup of ipecac and activated charcoal (6.0 +/- 0.3 vs 6.8 +/- 0.2 hours, respectively). The percentage of patients requiring nonpsychiatric hospitalizations was not significantly different between the two groups (11.2% vs 14.0%, respectively). For the hospitalized patients, the length of time spent in the ICU and in the hospital was not statistically different between the two groups. A complication rate of 5.4% was found with the ipecac and activated charcoal treatment compared with a 0.9% complication rate in the activated charcoal group (P less than or equal to .05). Three episodes of aspiration pneumonitis occurred after administration of ipecac and activated charcoal, while no episodes of aspiration were noted after treatment with only activated charcoal. Together, these data are consistent with the recommendation that ED treatment with activated charcoal alone be the gastrointestinal decontamination procedure of choice for the routine mildly-to-moderately orally poisoned adult patient.",

        "abstract": "Environmental degradation has the potential to alter key mutualisms that underlie the structure and function of ecological communities. How microbial communities associated with fishes vary across populations and in relation to habitat characteristics remains largely unknown despite their fundamental roles in host nutrition and immunity. We find significant differences in the gut microbiome composition of a facultative coral-feeding butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus) across Caribbean reefs that differ markedly in live coral cover (∼0-30%). Fish gut microbiomes were significantly more variable at degraded reefs, a pattern driven by changes in the relative abundance of the most common taxa potentially associated with stress. We also demonstrate that fish gut microbiomes on severely degraded reefs have a lower abundance of Endozoicomonas and a higher diversity of anaerobic fermentative bacteria, which may suggest a less coral dominated diet. The observed shifts in fish gut bacterial communities across the habitat gradient extend to a small set of potentially beneficial host associated bacteria (i.e., the core microbiome) suggesting essential fish-microbiome interactions may be vulnerable to severe coral degradation.",

We used this healthy reference dataset to explore how age, diet, and living environment correlate with fecal microbiome composition. Thirty core bacterial genera were identified. Prevotella, Bacteroides, Collinsella, Blautia, and Megasphaera were the most abundant, and Bacteroides, Blautia, Lachnoclostridium, Sutterella, and Ruminococcus gnavus were the most prevalent. While community composition remained relatively stable across different age classes, the number of core taxa present decreased significantly with age. Fecal microbiome composition varied with host diet type. Cats fed kibble had a slightly, but significantly greater number of core taxa compared to cats not fed any kibble. The core microbiomes of cats fed some raw food contained taxa not as highly prevalent or abundant as cats fed diets that included kibble. Living environment also had a large effect on fecal microbiome composition. Cats living in homes differed significantly from those in shelters and had a greater portion of their microbiomes represented by core taxa. Collectively our work reinforces the findings that age, diet, and living environment are important factors to consider when defining a core microbiome in a population.",

        "abstract": "The gut microbiome provides vital functions for mammalian hosts, yet research on its variability and function across adult life spans and multiple generations is limited in large mammalian carnivores. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic high-throughput sequencing to profile the bacterial taxonomic composition, genomic diversity, and metabolic function of fecal samples collected from 12 wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) residing in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, over a 23-year period spanning three generations. The metagenomic data came from four of these hyenas and spanned two 2-year periods. With these data, we determined the extent to which host factors predicted variation in the gut microbiome and identified the core microbes present in the guts of hyenas. We also investigated novel genomic diversity in the mammalian gut by reporting the first metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for hyenas. We found that gut microbiome taxonomic composition varied temporally, but despite this, a core set of 14 bacterial genera were identified. The strongest predictors of the microbiome were host identity and age, suggesting that hyenas possess individualized microbiomes and that these may change with age during adulthood. The gut microbiome functional profiles of the four adult hyenas were also individual specific and were associated with prey abundance, indicating that the functions of the gut microbiome vary with host diet. We recovered 149 high-quality MAGs from the hyenas' guts; some MAGs were classified as taxa previously reported for other carnivores, but many were novel and lacked species-level matches to genomes in existing reference databases. IMPORTANCE There is a gap in knowledge regarding the genomic diversity and variation of the gut microbiome across a host's life span and across multiple generations of hosts in wild mammals. Using two types of sequencing approaches, we found that although gut microbiomes were individualized and temporally variable among hyenas, they correlated similarly to large-scale changes in the ecological conditions experienced by their hosts. We also recovered 149 high-quality MAGs from the hyena gut, greatly expanding the microbial genome repertoire known for hyenas, carnivores, and wild mammals in general. Some MAGs came from genera abundant in the gastrointestinal tracts of canid species and other carnivores, but over 80% of MAGs were novel and from species not previously represented in genome databases. Collectively, our novel body of work illustrates the importance of surveying the gut microbiome of nonmodel wild hosts, using multiple sequencing methods and computational approaches and at distinct scales of analysis.",

        "abstract": "Whether the human fetus and the prenatal intrauterine environment (amniotic fluid and placenta) are stably colonized by microbial communities in a healthy pregnancy remains a subject of debate. Here we evaluate recent studies that characterized microbial populations in human fetuses from the perspectives of reproductive biology, microbial ecology, bioinformatics, immunology, clinical microbiology and gnotobiology, and assess possible mechanisms by which the fetus might interact with microorganisms. Our analysis indicates that the detected microbial signals are likely the result of contamination during the clinical procedures to obtain fetal samples or during DNA extraction and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, the existence of live and replicating microbial populations in healthy fetal tissues is not compatible with fundamental concepts of immunology, clinical microbiology and the derivation of germ-free mammals. These conclusions are important to our understanding of human immune development and illustrate common pitfalls in the microbial analyses of many other low-biomass environments. The pursuit of a fetal microbiome serves as a cautionary example of the challenges of sequence-based microbiome studies when biomass is low or absent, and emphasizes the need for a trans-disciplinary approach that goes beyond contamination controls by also incorporating biological, ecological and mechanistic concepts.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The US Department of Agriculture granted waivers to allow flexibility in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) operations during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, research examining the associations between waiver introduction and changes in perceptions, practices, and challenges of WIC participants' and agency directors' experiences is limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess California WIC participants' and agency directors' perceptions and practices of remote WIC services during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary aim was to understand other COVID-19 challenges related to maintaining access to healthy foods by WIC participants. DESIGN: A qualitative study that included semistructured interviews was conducted between June 2020 and March 2021. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: One hundred eighty-two WIC participants with a child aged 0 to 5 years from three regions of California (Southern, Central, and Northern) and 22 local WIC agency directors across the state were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WIC participants' and agency directors' perceptions, practices, and other challenges during COVID-19. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Participants shared that they valued the information received from WIC and were very satisfied with remote WIC services. Participants reported that enrolling in WIC remotely was easier than coming in person. All waivers and changes to WIC operations, namely the physical presence, remote benefit issuance, and separation of duties waivers, and remote work and remote delivery of nutrition education, were largely viewed by WIC agency directors as options that should be continued postpandemic. Further, a majority (63%) of households reported experiencing food insecurity, and half of respondents received food from a food bank or pantry during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest WIC will attract and retain the most families by offering a hybrid model of services, incorporating both onsite services and remote options to work more efficiently and effectively.",

In order to understand satisfaction, perceptions, and the overall impact of additional benefits for fruits and vegetables at the household level, a qualitative study consisting of structured phone interviews was conducted with families served by WIC in Southern California from November to December 2021 (n = 30). Families were selected from a large longitudinal study sample (N = 2784); the sample was restricted by benefit redemption and stratified by language and race. WIC participants were highly satisfied with the CVB increase, reporting increased purchasing and consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables. Respondents noted the improved quality and variety of fruits and vegetables purchased due to the increased amount. Findings are expected to inform policy makers to adjust the CVB offered in the WIC food package with the potential to improve participant satisfaction and increase participation and retention of eligible families with benefits from healthy diets supported by WIC.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine retrospectively whether access to a campus food pantry (CFP) is related to improvements in sleep, mental health, and physical health among college students in a public university system. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study of student CFP users who completed an online survey in the summer of 2019. SETTING: Ten-campus University of California system. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,855 students completed the survey. MAIN VARIABLES MEASURED: Students reported the number of CFP visits in a usual week or month. Students retrospectively rated their perceived health, depressive symptoms, and sleep sufficiency before and after having food pantry access. The difference between pre- and post-food pantry access responses was calculated. ANALYSIS: Path analysis was used to examine direct and indirect paths of the relationship between CFP visits with self-reported changes in depressive symptoms and perceived health through positive changes in self-reported sleep sufficiency, controlling for sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: More monthly CFP visits were directly related to decreased depressive symptoms and improved perceived health (βdepressive = 0.10, P < 0.001; βhealth = 0.12, P < 0.001). In addition, more CFP visits were related to improved sleep sufficiency (β = 0.09, P = 0.001), which in turn was related to a decrease in depressive symptoms (β = 0.24, P = 0.001; indirect effect: 0.02, P < 0.01) and improved perceived health (β = 0.23, P < 0.001; indirect effect: 0.02, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings suggest that college campus emergency food access is associated with self-reported improvements in student health outcomes associated with food security. Until more long-term solutions that improve college student nutrition are developed, food pantries may be filling a gap.",

The CACFP is associated with improved child diet quality, health outcomes, and food security. However CACFP participation rates are declining. Independent child care centers make up a substantial portion of CACFP sites, yet little is known about their barriers to participation. Researcher-led focus groups and interviews were conducted in 2021-2022 with 16 CACFP-participating independent centers and 5 CACFP sponsors across California CACFP administrative regions to identify participation benefits, barriers, and facilitators. Transcripts were coded for themes using the grounded theory method. CACFP benefits include reimbursement for food, supporting communities with low incomes, and healthy food guidelines. Barriers include paperwork, administrative reviews, communication, inadequate reimbursement, staffing, nutrition standards, training needs, eligibility determination, technological challenges, and COVID-19-related staffing and supply-chain issues. Facilitators included improved communication, additional and improved training, nutrition standards and administrative review support, online forms, reduced and streamlined paperwork. Sponsored centers cited fewer barriers than un-sponsored centers, suggesting sponsors facilitate independent centers' CACFP participation. CACFP participation barriers should be reduced to better support centers and improve nutrition and food security for families with low-income.",

        "abstract": "Public schools in the U.S. generate about 14,500 tons of municipal solid waste daily, and approximately 42% of that is food packaging generated by school foodservice, contributing significantly to the global packaging waste crisis. This literature review summarizes methods used to evaluate food packaging waste in school foodservice. This review has two objectives: first, to understand which methodologies currently exist to evaluate food packaging waste generation and disposal in school foodservice; and second, to describe the creation of and share a practical standardized instrument to evaluate food packaging waste generation and disposal in school foodservice. A systematic review was conducted using the following search terms: solid waste, school, cafeteria and food packaging, waste, and school. The final review included 24 studies conducted in school environments (kindergarten through twelfth grade or college/university), 16 of which took place in the U.S. Food packaging waste evaluations included objective methods of waste audits, models, and secondary data as well as subjective methods of qualitative observations, questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups. Large variation exists in the settings, participants, designs, and methodologies for evaluating school foodservice packaging waste. Lack of standardization was observed even within each methodology (e.g., waste audit). A new instrument is proposed to support comprehensive and replicable data collection, to further the understanding of school foodservice food packaging waste in the U.S., and to reduce environmental harms.",

An important wheat yield component is the number of grain-holding spikelets which form on the spike during inflorescence development. Characterizing the gene regulatory networks controlling the timing and rate of inflorescence development will facilitate the selection of natural and induced gene variants that contribute to increased spikelet number and yield. In the current study, co-expression and gene regulatory networks were assembled from a temporal wheat spike transcriptome dataset, revealing the dynamic expression profiles associated with the progression from vegetative meristem to terminal spikelet formation. Consensus co-expression networks revealed enrichment of several transcription factor families at specific developmental stages including the sequential activation of different classes of MIKC-MADS box genes. This gene regulatory network highlighted interactions among a small number of regulatory hub genes active during terminal spikelet formation. Finally, the CLAVATA and WUSCHEL gene families were investigated, revealing potential roles for TtCLE13, TtWOX2, and TtWOX7 in wheat meristem development. The hypotheses generated from these datasets and networks further our understanding of wheat inflorescence development.",

Key advancements in precise genome editing and new methods for rapid generation of bioengineered crops promise to both revolutionize the speed and breadth of breeding programmes and increase our ability to feed and sustain human population growth. Although genome editing enables targeted and specific modifications of DNA sequences, several existing barriers prevent the widespread adoption of editing technologies for basic and applied research in established and emerging crop species. Inefficient methods for the transformation and regeneration of recalcitrant species and the genotype dependency of the transformation process remain major hurdles. These limitations are frequent in monocotyledonous crops, which alone provide most of the calories consumed by human populations. Somatic embryogenesis and de novo induction of meristems - pluripotent groups of stem cells responsible for plant developmental plasticity - are essential strategies to quickly generate transformed plants. Here we review recent discoveries that are rapidly advancing nuclear transformation technologies and promise to overcome the obstacles that have so far impeded the widespread adoption of genome editing in crop species.",

        "abstract": "Differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) schedules have been used to evaluate the effects of a wide variety of drugs, including amphetamines, cannabinoids, and antidepressant medication. To earn a reinforcer, organisms operating under a DRL schedule are required to withhold a response for a predetermined amount of time before responding, and therefore this schedule maintains a low rate of responding and can be viewed as a response-inhibition task. In experiment 1, three different DRL schedules (4.5, 9.5, and 29.5 s) were used to evaluate systematically a range of nicotine doses (0.0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg). The dose-response effect of nicotine then was compared with the effects of increased reinforcer magnitude on responding. Both the administration of nicotine and increased reinforcer magnitude engendered less accurate DRL-schedule performance compared with baseline conditions, and the dose and magnitude-dependent shifts were most evident on the DRL 29.5-s schedule. Experiment 2 compared the differences between acute and chronic dosing regimens (0.3 mg/kg nicotine) on DRL 29.5-s schedule responding. After 20 consecutive sessions of nicotine dosing, accuracy deteriorated significantly, demonstrating that chronic nicotine dosing leads to a behavioral sensitization apparent on the DRL 29.5-s schedule. The results from both experiments suggest that responding on the DRL 29.5-s schedule is sensitive to both dose-response and regimen-dependent effects of nicotine.",

        "abstract": "Heading time is a critical feature determining wheat performance. Over the years, average global temperatures have increased, leading to adjustments in agronomic practices such as sowing dates and cultivar election. Bread wheat development is regulated by the effect of vernalization (Vrn), photoperiod sensitivity (Ps), and earliness per-se (Eps). The aim of this study was (i) to quantify the physiology behind wheat development for a wide range of contrasting commercial genotypes, and (ii) to design a simple wheat phenology prediction model that considers vernalization and photoperiod effects. Seventeen wheat genotypes that vary in VERNALIZATION-1 (Vrn1), PHOTOPERIOD-1 (Ppd1), and EARLINESS PER-SE D1 (Eps-D1) alleles were classified into four groups: Winter Sensitive (WS), Winter Insensitive (WI), Spring Sensitive (SS), and Spring Insensitive (SI). Field trials with vernalization treatments were carried out in different sites, years, and sowing dates. Genotypes with Vrn1 triple winter alleles exhibited the highest vernalization requirements, while cycle duration in spring genotypes remained constant. Photoperiod sensitivity was higher for those genotypes molecularly classified as Ppd1 sensitive but a differential response was evident when control and vernalization treatments were compared: after 6-week vernalization, Ps in WI decreased significantly without significant differences for WS, SS, and SI. For winter genotypes, the optimum photoperiod (Po) was the longest for the 6-week vernalized groups, and within that level of vernalization WI showed the longest Po values. The variability in Ps and Po values could be explained by the interaction between photoperiod and vernalization over Vrn1 upregulation and their consequent effect on wheat cycle duration. A wheat phenological model using photoperiod and vernalization correction factors was calibrated to predict heading dates in the Argentine wheat region. The model accurately predicted heading date with an error of 8.1, 6.5, 6.2, and 7.0 days for WI, WS, SI, and SS, respectively. The development of a model that uses simple universal process-based parameters is crucial for farmers, advisors, and researchers as it increases the precision in wheat cycle arrangement, but in a relatively parsimonious fashion.",

        "abstract": "Type Ia supernovae are critical for feedback and elemental enrichment in galaxies. Recent surveys like the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova (ASAS-SN) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) find that the specific supernova Ia rate at z ∼0 may be 20-50× higher in lower mass galaxies than at Milky Way-mass. Independently, observations show that the close-binary fraction of solar-Type Milky Way stars is higher at lower metallicity. Motivated by these observations, we use the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to explore the impact of metallicity-dependent rate models on galaxies of M_∗ ∼ 107-1011M·. First, we benchmark our simulated star formation histories against observations, and show that the assumed stellar mass functions play a major role in determining the degree of tension between observations and metallicity-independent rate models, potentially causing ASAS-SN and DES observations to agree more than might appear. Models in which the supernova Ia rate increases with decreasing metallicity propto Z-0.5 to-1) provide significantly better agreement with observations. Encouragingly, these rate increases (10× in low-mass galaxies) do not significantly impact galaxy masses and morphologies, which remain largely unaffected except for our most extreme models. We explore implications for both [Fe/H] and [αFe] enrichment; metallicity-dependent rate models can improve agreement with the observed stellar mass-metallicity relations in low-mass galaxies. Our results demonstrate that a range of metallicity-dependent rate models are viable for galaxy formation and motivate future work.",

        "abstract": "The physics of magnetic fields (B) and cosmic rays (CRs) have recently been included in simulations of galaxy formation. However, significant uncertainties remain in how these components affect galaxy evolution. To understand their common observational tracers, we analyse the magnetic fields in a set of high-resolution, magnetohydrodynamic, cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-like galaxies from the FIRE-2 project. We compare mock observables of magnetic field tracers for simulations with and without CRs to observations of Zeeman splitting and rotation/dispersion measures. We find reasonable agreement between simulations and observations in both the neutral and the ionized interstellar medium (ISM). We find that the simulated galaxies with CRs show weaker ISM |B| fields on average compared to their magnetic-field-only counterparts. This is a manifestation of the effects of CRs in the diffuse, low density inner circumgalactic medium (CGM). We find that equipartition between magnetic and cosmic ray energy densities may be valid at large (> 1 kpc) scales for typical ISM densities of Milky-Way-like galaxies, but not in their haloes. Within the ISM, the magnetic fields in our simulated galaxies follow a power-law scaling with gas density. The scaling extends down to neutral hydrogen number densities < 300 cm-3, in contrast to observationally derived models, but consistent with the observational measurements. Finally, we generate synthetic rotation measure (RM) profiles for projections of the simulated galaxies and compare to observational constraints in the CGM. While consistent with upper limits, improved data are needed to detect the predicted CGM RMs at 10-200 kpc and better constrain theoretical predictions.",

From >700 orbits of new/archival Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging, we identify >4700 RR Lyrae stars and determine their periods and mean magnitudes to a typical precision of 0.01 day and 0.04 mag. Based on period–Wesenheit–metallicity relationships consistent with the Gaia eDR3 distance scale, we uniformly measure heliocentric and M31-centric distances to a typical precision of ∼20 kpc (3%) and ∼10 kpc (8%), respectively. We revise the 3D structure of the M31 galactic ecosystem and: (i) confirm a highly anisotropic spatial distribution such that ∼80% of M31's satellites reside on the near side of M31; this feature is not easily explained by observational effects; (ii) affirm the thin (rms 7–23 kpc) planar “arc” of satellites that comprises roughly half (15) of the galaxies within 300 kpc from M31; (iii) reassess the physical proximity of notable associations such as the NGC 147/185 pair and M33/AND XXII; and (iv) illustrate challenges in tip-of-the-red-giant branch distances for galaxies with MV > − 9.5, which can be biased by up to 35%.

        "abstract": "In the Gaia era it is increasingly apparent that traditional static, parameterized models are insufficient to describe the mass distribution of our complex, dynamically evolving Milky Way (MW). In this work, we compare different time-evolving and time-independent representations of the gravitational potentials of simulated MW-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological-baryonic simulations. Using these potentials, we calculate actions for star particles in tidal streams around three galaxies with varying merger histories at each snapshot from 7 Gyr ago to the present day. We determine the action-space coherence preserved by each model using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to gauge the degree of clustering in actions and the relative stability of the clusters over time. We find that all models produce a clustered action space for simulations with no significant mergers. However, a massive (mass ratio prior to infall more similar than 1:8) interacting galaxy not present in the model will result in mischaracterized orbits for stars most affected by the interaction. The locations of the action space clusters (i.e., the orbits of the stream stars) are only preserved by the time-evolving model, while the time-independent models can lose significant amounts of information as soon as 0.5-1 Gyr ago, even if the system does not undergo a significant merger. Our results imply that reverse-integration of stream orbits in the MW using a fixed potential is likely to give incorrect results if integrated longer than 0.5 Gyr into the past.",

        "abstract": "The orbits of satellite galaxies encode rich information about their histories. We investigate the orbital dynamics and histories of satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass host galaxies using the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations, which, as previous works have shown, produce satellite mass functions and spatial distributions that broadly agree with observations. We first examine trends in orbital dynamics at z = 0, including total velocity, specific angular momentum, and specific total energy: the time of infall into the MW-mass halo primarily determines these orbital properties. We then examine orbital histories, focusing on the lookback time of first infall into a host halo and pericentre distances, times, and counts. Roughly 37 per cent of galaxies with Mstar ≲ 107, M⊙ were 'pre-processed' as a satellite in a lower-mass group, typically ≈ 2.7 Gyr before falling into the MW-mass halo. Half of all satellites at z = 0 experienced multiple pericentres about their MW-mass host. Remarkably, for most (67 per cent) of these satellites, their most recent pericentre was not their minimum pericentre: the minimum typically was ∼40 per cent smaller and occurred ∼ 6 Gyr earlier. These satellites with growing pericentres appear to have multiple origins: for about half, their specific angular momentum gradually increased over time, while for the other half, most rapidly increased near their first apocentre, suggesting that a combination of a time-dependent MW-mass halo potential and dynamical perturbations in the outer halo caused these satellites' pericentres to grow. Our results highlight the limitations of idealized, static orbit modelling, especially for pericentre histories.",

METHODS: The CDC-funded trial (NCT02986113) of Men and Providers Preventing Suicide aimed to examine the effects of a tailored computer program encourage men with suicidal thoughts (n = 304, ages 35-64) to discuss suicide with a primary care clinician and accept treatment. Before a visit, participants viewed MAPS or a non-tailored control video. Post-visit, both arms were offered telephone collaborative care, as mandated by the institutional review board (IRB). We previously showed that exposure to MAPs led to improvements in communication about suicide in a primary care visit. In this paper, we report data on the study's primary outcome, suicide preparatory behaviors. RESULTS: After screening nearly 4100 men, 48 enrolled. Recruitment challenges, which were exacerabted by an IRB mandate narrowing post-intervention patient management differences between trial arms, limited detection of the effects of MAPS on suicide preparatory behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: While primary care settings are key sites for suicide prevention trials, issues such as recruitment difficulties and overly restrictive IRB requirements may limit their utility. Methodological innovation to improve recruitment and ethical guidance to inform IRB decision-making are needed.",

Such tools include symptom checkers that provide users with a potential diagnosis after responding to a set of probes about their symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand who uses a web-based artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker and its purposes, how they evaluate the experience of the web-based interview and quality of the information, what they intend to do with the recommendation, and predictors of future use. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of web-based health information seekers following the completion of a symptom checker visit (N=2437). Measures of comprehensibility, confidence, usefulness, health-related anxiety, empowerment, and intention to use in the future were assessed. ANOVAs and the Wilcoxon rank sum test examined mean outcome differences in racial, ethnic, and sex groups. The relationship between perceptions of the symptom checker and intention to follow recommended actions was assessed using multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: Buoy users were well-educated (1384/1704, 81.22% college or higher), primarily White (1227/1693, 72.47%), and female (2069/2437, 84.89%). Most had insurance (1449/1630, 88.89%), a regular health care provider (1307/1709, 76.48%), and reported good health (1000/1703, 58.72%). Three types of symptoms-pain (855/2437, 35.08%), gynecological issues (293/2437, 12.02%), and masses or lumps (204/2437, 8.37%)-accounted for almost half (1352/2437, 55.48%) of site visits. Buoy's top three primary recommendations split across less-serious triage categories: primary care physician in 2 weeks (754/2141, 35.22%), self-treatment (452/2141, 21.11%), and primary care in 1 to 2 days (373/2141, 17.42%). Common diagnoses were musculoskeletal (303/2437, 12.43%), gynecological (304/2437, 12.47%) and skin conditions (297/2437, 12.19%), and infectious diseases (300/2437, 12.31%). Users generally reported high confidence in Buoy, found it useful and easy to understand, and said that Buoy made them feel less anxious and more empowered to seek medical help. Users for whom Buoy recommended \"Waiting/Watching\" or \"Self-Treatment\" had strongest intentions to comply, whereas those advised to seek primary care had weaker intentions. Compared with White users, Latino and Black users had significantly more confidence in Buoy (P<.05), and the former also found it significantly more useful (P<.05). Latino (odds ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.22-3.25) and Black (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.57-3.66) users also had stronger intentions to discuss recommendations with a provider than White users. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate the potential utility of a web-based health information tool to empower people to seek care and reduce health-related anxiety. However, despite encouraging results suggesting the tool may fulfill unmet health information needs among women and Black and Latino adults, analyses of the user base illustrate persistent second-level digital divide effects.",

        "abstract": "The term 'data science' usually refers to the process of extracting value from big data obtained from a large group of individuals. An alternative rendition, which we call personalized data science (Per-DS), aims to collect, analyze, and interpret personal data to inform personal decisions. This article describes the main features of Per-DS, and reviews its current state and future outlook. A Per-DS investigation is of, by, and for an individual, the Per-DS investigator, acting simultaneously as her own investigator, study participant, and beneficiary, and making personalized decisions for study design and implementation. The scope of Per-DS studies may include systematic monitoring of physiological or behavioral patterns, case-crossover studies for symptom triggers, pre-post trials for exposure-outcome relationships, and personalized (N-of-1) trials for effectiveness. Per-DS studies produce personal knowledge generalizable to the individual's future self (thus benefiting herself) rather than knowledge generalizable to an external population (thus benefiting others). This endeavor requires a pivot from data mining or extraction to data gardening, analogous to home gardeners producing food for home consumption-the Per-DS investigator needs to 'cultivate the field' by setting goals, specifying study design, identifying necessary data elements, and assembling instruments and tools for data collection. Then, she can implement the study protocol, harvest her personal data, and mine the data to extract personal knowledge. To facilitate Per-DS studies, Per-DS investigators need support from community-based, scientific, philanthropic, business, and government entities, to develop and deploy resources such as peer forums, mobile apps, 'virtual field guides,' and scientific and regulatory guidance.",

        "abstract": "The androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed and hyperactivated in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the determinants of AR overexpression in CRPC are poorly defined. Here we show that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (ROR-γ) is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC tumors, and that ROR-γ drives AR expression in the tumors. ROR-γ recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3, also known as SRC-1 and SRC-3) to an AR-ROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR gene transcription. ROR-γ antagonists suppress the expression of both AR and its variant AR-V7 in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and tumors. ROR-γ antagonists also markedly diminish genome-wide AR binding, H3K27ac abundance and expression of the AR target gene network. Finally, ROR-γ antagonists suppressed tumor growth in multiple AR-expressing, but not AR-negative, xenograft PCa models, and they effectively sensitized CRPC tumors to enzalutamide, without overt toxicity, in mice. Taken together, these results establish ROR-γ as a key player in CRPC by acting upstream of AR and as a potential therapeutic target for advanced PCa.",

Optimal in vitro methods used in elucidating disease mechanisms would deliver of low levels of hydrogen peroxide, emulating the in vivo pathological state, but current methods are limited by kinetic stability or accurate measurement of the dose administered. Here we present an in vitro platform that exploits anthraquinone catalysts for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide. This system can be dynamically tuned to provide constant generation of hydrogen peroxide at a desired physiologic rate over at least 14 days and is described using a kinetic model. Material characterization and stability is discussed along with a proof-of-concept in vitro study that assessed the viability of cells as they were oxidatively challenged over 24 h at different ROS generation rates.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: There have been important advances in defining effector mechanisms for several human autoimmune diseases. However, for most human autoimmune diseases, the induction stage is less well defined and there are very few clues on etiology. Our laboratory has focused on defining the molecular basis of autoantibody recognition and epitope modification in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Our work has demonstrated that antibodies to mitochondria, the hallmark of disease, are directed against a very conserved site of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC-E2). We have also demonstrated that several chemical xenobiotics, chosen based on quantitative structural activity relationship analysis and rigorous epitope analysis, when coupled to the lysine residue that normally binds the lipoic acid cofactor of PDC-E2, reacts as well or better to PBC sera than native autoantigen. In the present studies, we immunized C57BL/6 mice with one such xenobiotic, 2-octynoic acid, coupled to bovine serum albumin and we followed the mice for 24 weeks. Animals were studied for appearance of histologic lesions as well as appearance of antibodies to PDC-E2, serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, and splenic and liver lymphoid phenotyping by flow cytometry. Mice immunized with 2-octynoic acid manifest autoimmune cholangitis, typical mitochondrial autoantibodies, increased liver lymphoid cell numbers, an increase in CD8(+) liver infiltrating cells, particularly CD8(+) T cells that coexpress CD44, and finally an elevation of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma. CONCLUSION: these data provide a persuasive argument in favor of an environmental origin for human PBC.",

In these settings, calves often perform abnormal repetitive behaviors (ARBs), including tongue rolling and nonnutritive oral manipulation (NNOM), which, based on their form, seem similar to movements used when processing feed. Feeding hay, typically presented as a short chop (≤5 cm) in a bucket, reduces ARBs. Our objective was to evaluate whether altering the presentation method of long hay (∼19 cm), by providing it in a bucket or a novel polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe feeder, could reduce ARBs. Holstein heifer calves were housed individually on sand and fed ad libitum starter grain and limited milk replacer (5.7-8.4 L/d step-up) via a bottle (Control, n = 9) or given access to mountaingrass hay in a bucket (Bucket, n = 9) or in a PVC pipe feeder (Pipe, n = 9). The 56 × 10.2 cm (length × diameter) PVC pipe feeder had 4 openings that were 6.35 cm wide, which required the calf to insert her tongue into the pipe and curl her tongue to extract hay. Treatments were applied from birth through 50 d of age, when step-down weaning began and TMR was provided to all calves. Calves were fully weaned at d 60. At wk 4 and 6, oral behaviors (eating, ruminating, drinking water, sucking milk, self-grooming, NNOM, tongue rolling, tongue flicking, and panting) were recorded by direct observation for 24 h using 1-0 sampling during 5-s intervals. Feeding long hay, regardless of presentation method, increased overall DMI, grain intake, and ADG compared with Control calves. Hay provision also increased rumination (25 vs. 15% of 24-h observations in Control) and eating time (5.5 vs. 2% in Control). Abnormal behaviors were seen in all calves. Hay provision reduced some of these, including NNOM (5 vs. 9% in Control). There was no difference in NNOM between calves fed hay in a pipe or bucket, even though Bucket calves consumed more hay (178 vs. 129 g/d in wk 6) and tended to spend more observations eating hay than Pipe calves (4.5 vs. 3%). Hay provision did not affect other behaviors: drinking water (0.5%), grooming (3%), or tongue flicking (3%). We also found evidence of other abnormal oral behaviors that have received less attention. Calves showed signs of polydipsia, and displayed excessive grooming, the latter indicated by overall duration, number of bouts per day, and duration of individual bouts (up to 25 min). Tongue rolling was expressed at low levels (up to 0.4% of intervals) but by 85% of calves. Feeding hay, both in a bucket and using novel methods, was not enough to counteract the welfare challenges associated with individual housing and limited ability to suck milk (<1% of time). Provision of long hay, regardless of presentation method, promotes rumination, improves performance (higher grain intake and ADG) and reduces at least some, but not all, of the considerable abnormal oral behaviors these calves performed.",

        "abstract": "In 2 experiments, free-stall dimensions were examined to determine how they affected stall preference, usage, cleanliness, and milk production in Holstein dairy cattle. In experiment 1, stall width (112 or 132 cm) and stall length (229 and 274 cm from curb to wall) were compared in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of stall treatments using 15 individually housed, non-lactating animals. Cows showed no clear preference for stall size as measured by lying time. When animals had no choice between stalls, average lying time was higher in the wide stalls than in the narrow stalls (10.8 vs. 9.6+/-0.3 h/24 h). Both length and width affected time spent standing with only the front hooves in the stall; total stall area is best explained by the variation associated with this behavior. In experiment 2, 27 lactating dairy cattle were alternately housed with access to stalls of 106, 116, or 126 cm in width using a cross-over design with exposure to each treatment lasting 3 wk. Animals spent an additional 42 min/24 h lying in stalls measuring 126 cm in width compared with stalls with only 106 cm between partitions. Free-stall width influenced the time spent standing with the front 2 hooves in the stall; animals averaged 58 min/24 h in the widest stalls and 85 min/24 h in the narrowest stalls. The amount of time spent standing with all 4 hooves in the stall tended to be longer in wider stalls, and these stalls were also most likely to become soiled with feces. Stall width did not affect the number of lying events or milk production. In conclusion, animals spent more time lying down, and less time was spent standing with only the front hooves in larger stalls, but larger stalls were also more likely to become soiled.",

        "abstract": "In a series of 3 experiments, we documented how sand-bedding depth and distribution changed within freestalls after new bedding was added and the effect of these changes on lying behavior. In experiment 1, we measured changes in bedding depth over a 10-d period at 43 points in 24 freestalls. Change in depth of sand was the greatest the day after new sand was added and decreased over time. Over time, the stall surface became concave, and the deepest part of the stall was at the center. Based on the results of experiment 1, we measured changes in lying behavior when groups of cows had access to freestalls with sand bedding that was 0, 3.5, 5.2, or 6.2 cm at the deepest point, below the curb, while other dimensions remained fixed. We found that daily lying time was 1.15 h shorter in stalls with the lowest levels of bedding compared with stalls filled with bedding. Indeed, for every 1-cm decrease in bedding, cows spent 11 min less time lying down during each 24-h period. In a third experiment, we imposed 4 treatments that reflected the variation in sand depth within stalls: 0, 6.2, 9.9, and 13.7 cm below the curb. Again, lying times reduced with decreasing bedding, such that cows using the stalls with the least amount of bedding (13.7 cm below curb) spent 2.33 h less time per day lying down than when housed with access to freestalls filled with sand (0 cm below curb).",

        "abstract": "One important criterion in choosing appropriate housing systems for dairy cattle is that the freestall provides a comfortable surface for the cow. This paper describes two experiments testing the effects of commonly used lying surfaces on stall preference and stall usage by Holstein cows. In both experiments, 12 cows were housed individually in separate pens. Each pen contained three free stalls with a different surface: deep-bedded sawdust, deep-bedded sand, and a geotextile mattress covered with 2 to 3 cm of sawdust. The animals were restricted to each surface in turn, in a random order for either 2 (Experiment 1) or 3 d (Experiment 2). Both before and after this restriction phase, the animals were allowed access to all three surfaces, and preference was determined, based on lying times. Of the 12 cows used in Experiment 1, 10 preferred sawdust before and nine after the restriction phase. During the restriction phase, average lying times and number of lying events during the restriction phase were significantly lower for the sand-bedded stalls (P < or = 0.05), and standing times were higher on mattresses (P < or = 0.05), compared with sawdust. Although these cows had some experience with all three surfaces during the experiment, they had been housed in sawdust-bedded stalls during their previous lactation. Cows used in Experiment 2 had spent their previous lactation in sand bedded stalls. In this experiment, about half the cows preferred sand and half sawdust, after the restriction phase. During the restriction phase of experiment, lying times and number of lying events were lower, and standing times were higher when the animals were restricted to the mattresses compared to either sand or sawdust (P < or = 0.05). These results indicate that (1) free stall surface can affect both stall preferences and stall usage, and (2) mattresses are less preferred.",

        "abstract": "A dual flow continuous culture system was used to examine the effects of varying sugar as a proportion of sugar plus starch (NSC) at three concentrations of NSC on nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation and microbial growth. Diets contained 240, 280 and 330 g NSC/kg DM. At each NSC level, diets contained 29, 63 and 95 g sugar/kg DM. Corn grain and corn silage were the major starch sources. Liquid sugar blend (LSB) was the supplemental sugar source. Negative responses with interactions were seen at the 63 g sugar/kg DM level compared to no added sugar or 95 g sugar/kg DM in microbial growth, dry matter digested, protein digested, and total carbohydrate digested. Interactions resulted mostly because the negative responses to the 63 g sugar/kg DM were with the 240 and 280 g NSC/kg DM levels, but not with the 330 g NSC/kg DM level. Sugar addition depressed fiber digestion only with the 240 g NSC/kg DM level. At 330 g NSC/kg DM, all sugar substitutions were beneficial. Microbial responses were highest on the 330 g NSC/kg DM diet with 95 g sugar/kg DM, in which sugar made up 290 g/kg of the total NSC. Sugar additions at 95 g sugar/kg DM resulted in large increases in butyrate production. All sugar levels decreased acetate production but had little effect on propionate production. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Effective research, education, and outreach efforts by the Arabidopsis thaliana community, as well as other scientific communities that depend on Arabidopsis resources, depend vitally on easily available and publicly-shared resources. These resources include reference genome sequence data and an ever-increasing number of diverse data sets and data types. TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) and Araport (originally named the Arabidopsis Information Portal) are community informatics resources that provide tools, data, and applications to the more than 30,000 researchers worldwide that use in their work either Arabidopsis as a primary system of study or data derived from Arabidopsis. Four years after Araport's establishment, the IAIC held another workshop to evaluate the current status of Arabidopsis Informatics and chart a course for future research and development. The workshop focused on several challenges, including the need for reliable and current annotation, community-defined common standards for data and metadata, and accessible and user-friendly repositories/tools/methods for data integration and visualization. Solutions envisioned included (a) a centralized annotation authority to coalesce annotation from new groups, establish a consistent naming scheme, distribute this format regularly and frequently, and encourage and enforce its adoption. (b) Standards for data and metadata formats, which are essential, but challenging when comparing across diverse genotypes and in areas with less-established standards (e.g., phenomics, metabolomics). Community-established guidelines need to be developed. (c) A searchable, central repository for analysis and visualization tools. Improved versioning and user access would make tools more accessible. Workshop participants proposed a \"one-stop shop\" website, an Arabidopsis \"Super-Portal\" to link tools, data resources, programmatic standards, and best practice descriptions for each data type. This must have community buy-in and participation in its establishment and development to encourage adoption.",

The design of the AIP will provide core functionality while remaining flexible to encourage multiple contributors and constant innovation. An IAIC-hosted Design Workshop in December 2011 proposed a structure for the AIP to provide a framework for the minimal components of a functional community portal while retaining flexibility to rapidly extend the resource to other species.

Inbreeding depression was mild, ranging from 5-40%, but significant effects were detected for characters measured at all stages of the life cycle. Fitness components declined significantly with the inbreeding coefficient, and regression of fitness characters on inbreeding coefficients gave no evidence of any strongly synergistic effects attributable to the different genetic factors that contribute to decline in fitness under inbreeding. The magnitude of inbreeding depression did not clearly decrease with the populations' levels of inbreeding. This is not surprising because the selfing rates are similar enough that it is unlikely that the populations have been characterized for long periods of time by these different inbreeding levels.",

However, the rapid expansion in many data types, the international basis of the Arabidopsis community, and changing priorities of the funding agencies all suggest the need for changes in the way informatics infrastructure is developed and maintained. We propose that there is a need for a single core resource that is integrated into a larger international consortium of investigators. We envision this to consist of a distributed system of data, tools, and resources, accessed via a single information portal and funded by a variety of sources, under shared international management of an International Arabidopsis Informatics Consortium (IAIC).

        "abstract": "In plants, heterochromatin is maintained by a small RNA-based gene silencing mechanism known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). RdDM requires the non-redundant functions of two plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RNAP), RNAP IV and RNAP V. RNAP IV plays a major role in siRNA biogenesis, while RNAP V may recruit DNA methylation machinery to target endogenous loci for silencing. Although small RNA-generating regions that are dependent on both RNAP IV and RNAP V have been identified previously, the genomic loci targeted by RNAP V for siRNA accumulation and silencing have not been described extensively. To characterize the RNAP V-dependent, heterochromatic siRNA-generating regions in the Arabidopsis genome, we deeply sequenced the small RNA populations of wild-type and RNAP V null mutant (nrpe1) plants. Our results showed that RNAP V-dependent siRNA-generating loci are associated predominately with short repetitive sequences in intergenic regions. Suppression of small RNA production from short repetitive sequences was also prominent in RdDM mutants including dms4, drd1, dms3 and rdm1, reflecting the known association of these RdDM effectors with RNAP V. The genomic regions targeted by RNAP V were small, with an estimated average length of 238 bp. Our results suggest that RNAP V affects siRNA production from genomic loci with features dissimilar to known RNAP IV-dependent loci. RNAP V, along with RNAP IV and DRM1/2, may target and silence a set of small, intergenic transposable elements located in dispersed genomic regions for silencing. Silencing at these loci may be actively reinforced by RdDM.",

        "abstract": "Galaxies change their properties as they assemble into clusters. In order to understand the physics behind that, we need to go back in time and observe directly what is occurring in galaxies as they fall into a cluster. We have conducted a narrowband and J-band imaging survey on a cluster CL1604-D at z = 0.923 using a new infrared instrument SWIMS installed at the Subaru Telescope. The narrowband filter, NB1261, matches to Hα emission from the cluster at z = 0.923. Combined with a wide range of existing data from various surveys, we have investigated galaxy properties in and around this cluster in great detail. We have identified 27 Hα emitters associated with the cluster. They have significant overlap with MIPS 24,μ m sources and are located exclusively in the star-forming regime on the rest-frame UVJ diagram. We have identified two groups of galaxies near the cluster in the 2D spatial distribution and the phase-space diagram, which are likely to be in-falling to the cluster main body. We have compared various physical properties of star-forming galaxies, such as specific star formation rates (burstiness) and morphologies (merger) as a function of environment, cluster center, older group, younger group, and the field. As a result, a global picture has emerged on how the galaxy properties are altered as they assemble into a denser region. This includes the occurrence of mergers, enhancement of star formation activity, excursion to the dusty starburst phase, and eventual quenching to a passive phase.",

A study of the 118 ALPINE pointings revealed several serendipitous lines. Based on their fidelity, we selected 14 lines for the final catalog. According to the redshift of their counterparts, we identified eight out of 14 detections as [C II] lines at z ∼ 5, along with two as CO transitions at lower redshifts. The remaining four lines have an elusive identification in the available catalogs and we considered them as [C II] candidates. We used the eight confirmed [C II] and the four [C II] candidates to build one of the first [C II] LFs at z ∼ 5. We found that 11 out of these 12 sources have a redshift very similar to that of the ALPINE target in the same pointing, suggesting the presence of overdensities around the targets. Therefore, we split the sample in two (a \"clustered\"and \"field\"subsample) according to their redshift separation and built two separate LFs. Our estimates suggest that there could be an evolution of the [C II] LF between z ∼ 5 and z ∼ 0. By converting the [C II] luminosity to the star-formation rate, we evaluated the cosmic star-formation rate density (SFRD) at z ∼ 5. The clustered sample results in a SFRD ∼10 times higher than previous measurements from UV-selected galaxies. On the other hand, from the field sample (likely representing the average galaxy population), we derived a SFRD ∼1.6 higher compared to current estimates from UV surveys but compatible within the errors. Because of the large uncertainties, observations of larger samples will be necessary to better constrain the SFRD at z ∼ 5. This study represents one of the first efforts aimed at characterizing the demography of [C II] emitters at z ∼ 5 using a mm selection of galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Recent hydrodynamic simulations and observations of radio jets have shown that the surrounding environment has a large effect on their resulting morphology. To investigate this, we use a sample of 50 Extended Radio Active Galactic Nuclei (ERAGN) detected in the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments survey. These sources are all successfully cross-identified to galaxies within a redshift range of 0.55 ≤ z ≤ 1.35, either through spectroscopic redshifts or accurate photometric redshifts. We find that ERAGN are more compact in high-density environments than those in low-density environments at a significance level of 4.5σ. Among a series of internal properties under our scrutiny, only the radio power demonstrates a positive correlation with their spatial extent. After removing the possible radio power effect, the difference of size in low- and high-density environments persists. In the global environment analyses, the majority (86%) of high-density ERAGN reside in the cluster/group environment. In addition, ERAGN in the cluster/group central regions are preferentially compact with a small scatter in size, compared to those in the cluster/group intermediate regions and fields. In conclusion, our data appear to support the interpretation that the dense intracluster gas in the central regions of galaxy clusters plays a major role in confining the spatial extent of radio jets.",

We constrain the active galactic nuclei (AGN) contribution to the total IR luminosity (fAGN), and estimate the AGN luminosity (LAGN) and the star formation rate (SFR). Based on the fAGN and radio luminosity, radio-IR galaxies are split into galaxies that host either high- or low-fAGN AGN (high-/low-fAGN), and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with little to no AGN activity. We study the properties of the three radio-IR sub-samples comparing to an underlying parent sample. In the comparison of radio luminosity of three sub-samples, no significant difference was found, which could be due to the combined contribution of radio emission from AGN and star formation. We find a positive relationship between LAGN and specific SFR (sSFR) for both AGN sub-samples, strongly suggesting a co-evolution scenario of AGN and SF in these galaxies. A toy model is designed to demonstrate this co-evolution scenario, where we find that, in almost all cases, a rapid quenching time-scale is required, which we argue is a signature of AGN quenching. The environmental preference for intermediate/infall regions of clusters/groups remains across the co-evolution scenario, which suggests that galaxies might be in an orbital motion around the cluster/group during the scenario.",

        "abstract": "<jats:p> Verticillium wilt is one of the most devastating soilborne diseases in lettuce, and the use of host resistance is the most optimal choice for its management. This study focused on identifying and mapping the genetic loci for resistance against Verticillium dahliae race 3 in a mapping population of 200 F<jats:sub>2:3</jats:sub> families developed from a cross between moderately resistant red-leaf lettuce ‘Sentry’ and susceptible green-leaf lettuce ‘La Brillante’. The population was genotyped using the tunable genotyping-by-sequencing (tGBS) approach. An ultra-high-density genetic linkage map containing 34,838 single nucleotide polymorphism markers grouped into 1,734 bins was constructed using F<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> progeny and a sliding window approach. Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to V. dahliae race 3 were located on linkage groups (LGs) LG 2 ( qVR3-2.1) and LG 4 ( qVR3-4.1 and qVR3-4.2). Each of these QTLs explained up to ∼10% of the total phenotypic variation for the trait. At each locus, the resistance alleles were derived from cultivar Sentry that is partially resistant to the pathogen. Additional loci resistant to the disease are expected in this population, and transgressive segregation indicates that some of those loci could originate from the susceptible cultivar La Brillante. In addition, two QTLs for plant development were identified on LG 2 ( qIPD-2.1) and LG 7 ( qIPD-7.1), although no relationship was detected between resistance in these genotypes and the rate of plant growth. A major effect of QTL for red leaf color was detected on LG 9 ( qRLC-9.1). Candidate genes linked to some of the QTLs for V. dahliae race 3 resistance, plant development, and leaf color were identified. The QTLs for resistance identified in Sentry could diversify the resistance gene pool and provide an alternative tool to manage a newly emerged V. dahliae race 3. </jats:p><jats:p> [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

        "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) bind to the promoters of target genes to regulate gene expression in response to different stimuli. The functions and regulatory mechanisms of transcription factors (TFs) in Verticillium dahliae are, however, still largely unclear. This study showed that a C2H2-type zinc finger TF, VdCf2 (V. dahliae chorion transcription factor 2), plays key roles in V. dahliae growth, melanin production, and virulence. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that VdCf2 was involved in the regulation of expression of genes encoding secreted proteins, pathogen-host interaction (PHI) homologs, TFs, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Furthermore, VdCf2 positively regulated the expression of VdPevD1 (VDAG_02735), a previously reported virulence factor. VdCf2 thus regulates the expression of several pathogenicity-related genes that also contribute to virulence in V. dahliae. VdCf2 also inhibited the transcription of the Vd276-280 gene cluster and interacted with two members encoding proteins (VDAG_07276 and VDAG_07278) in the gene cluster. IMPORTANCE Verticillium dahliae is an important soilborne phytopathogen which can ruinously attack numerous host plants and cause significant economic losses. Transcription factors (TFs) were reported to be involved in various biological processes, such as hyphal growth and virulence of pathogenic fungi. However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of TFs in V. dahliae remain largely unclear. In this study, we identified a new transcription factor, VdCf2 (V. dahliae chorion transcription factor 2), based on previous transcriptome data, which participates in growth, melanin production, and virulence of V. dahliae. We provide evidence that VdCf2 regulates the expression of the pathogenicity-related gene VdPevD1 (VDAG_02735) and Vd276-280 gene cluster. VdCf2 also interacts with VDAG_07276 and VDAG_07278 in this gene cluster based on a yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. These results revealed the regulatory mechanisms of a pivotal pathogenicity-related transcription factor, VdCf2 in V. dahliae.",

        "abstract": "Verticillium wilt, caused by the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae, is the major cause of disease-related yield losses in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). Despite these losses, the major cultivars of G. hirsutum remain highly susceptible to Verticillium wilt. The lack of understanding on the genetic basis for Verticillium wilt resistance may further hinder progress in deploying elite cultivars with proven resistance, such as the wilt resistant G. hirsutum cultivar Zhongzhimian No. 2. To help remedy this knowledge gap, we sequenced the whole genome of Zhongzhimian No. 2 and assembled it from a combination of PacBio long reads, Illumina short reads, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture technologies. The final assembly of the genome was 2.33 Gb, encoding 95,327 predicted coding sequences. The GC content was 34.39% with 99.2% of the bases anchored to 26 pseudo-chromosomes that ranged from 53.8 to 127.7 Mb. This resource will help gain a detailed understanding of the genomic features governing high yield and Verticillium wilt resistance in this cultivar. Comparative genomics will be particularly helpful, since there are several published genomes of other Gossypium species. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

VdPtc2 and VdPtc4 are missing in the genome of the V. dahliae XJ592 strain. VdPtc3 is the homolog of Ptc2, Ptc3, and Ptc4 proteins in S. cerevisiae, implying that VdPtc3 may play versatile functions in V. dahliae. VdPtc3 promoted conidium development, melanin, and microsclerotium formation in V. dahliae. The ΔVdPtc3 strains showed increased sensitivity to NaCl and sorbitol and augmented the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase homolog Hog1 induced by osmotic stress. Besides, the ΔVdPtc3 strains also showed milder Verticillium wilt symptom on cotton. Furthermore, VdPtc3 interacts with VdAtg1, which modulates melanin and microsclerotium formation, as well as pathogenicity.",

Our prior work has implicated both nitric oxide (NO) produced by NO synthase 1 (NOS1) and calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity as required mediators of this form of mechano‐chemo‐transduction. To test whether a single <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>‐nitrosylation site on CaMKIIδ (Cys290) mediates enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> leak and afterload‐induced increases in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> uptake and release, we created a novel CRISPR‐based CaMKIIδ knock‐in (KI) mouse with a Cys to Ala mutation at C290. These CaMKIIδ‐C290A‐KI mice exhibited normal cardiac morphometry and function, as well as basal myocyte Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> transients (CaTs) and β‐adrenergic responses. However, the NO donor <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>‐nitrosoglutathione caused an acute increased Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> spark frequency in wild‐type (WT) myocytes that was absent in the CaMKIIδ‐C290A‐KI myocytes. Using our cell‐in‐gel system to exert multiaxial three‐dimensional mechanical afterload on myocytes during contraction, we found that WT myocytes exhibited an afterload‐induced increase in Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> sparks and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> transient amplitude and rate of decline. These afterload‐induced effects were prevented in both cardiac‐specific CaMKIIδ knockout and point mutant CaMKIIδ‐C290A‐KI myocytes. We conclude that CaMKIIδ activation by <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>‐nitrosylation at the C290 site is essential in mediating the intrinsic afterload‐induced enhancement of myocyte SR Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> uptake, release and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> transient amplitude (the Anrep effect). The data also indicate that NOS1 activation is upstream of <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>‐nitrosylation at C290 of CaMKII, and that this molecular mechano‐chemo‐transduction pathway is beneficial in allowing the heart to increase contractility to limit the reduction in stroke volume when aortic pressure (afterload) is elevated.\n<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/png\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tjp15313-gra-0001-m.png\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Key points</jats:title><jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>A novel CRISPR‐based CaMKIIδ knock‐in mouse was created in which kinase activation by <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>‐nitrosylation at Cys290 (C290A) is prevented.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>How afterload affects Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> signalling was measured in cardiac myocytes that were embedded in a hydrogel that imposes a three‐dimensional afterload.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>This mechanical afterload induced an increase in Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> transient amplitude and decay in wild‐type myocytes, but not in cardiac‐specific CaMKIIδ knockout or C290A knock‐in myocytes.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>The CaMKIIδ‐C290 <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>‐nitrosylation site is essential for the afterload‐induced enhancement of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> transient amplitude and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> sparks.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec>",

In this paper, we describe somatic and germinal transactivation of Ds by chimeric transposase genes in whole plants. Constructs containing either the Ds element or the Ac transposase open reading frame (ORF) were introduced into lettue. The Ds element was located between either the 35S or the Nos promoter and a chimeric spectinomycin resistance gene (which included a transit peptide), preventing expression of spectinomycin resistance. The genomic coding region of the Ac transposase was expressed from the 35S promoter. Crosses were made between 104 independent R1 plants containing Ds and three independent R1 plants expressing transposase. The excision of Ds in F1 progenies was monitored using a phenotypic assay on spectinomycin-containing medium. Green sectors in one-third of the F1 families indicated transactivation of Ds by the transposase at different developmental stages and at different frequencies in lettuce plants. Excision was confirmed using PCR and by Southern analysis. The lack of green sectors in the majority of F1 families suggest that the majority of T-DNA insertion sites are not conducive to excision. In subsequent experiments, the F1 plants containing both Ds and the transposase were grown to maturity and the F2 seeds screened on medium containing spectinomycin. Somatic excision was again observed in several F2 progeny; however, evidence for germinal excision was observed in only one F2 family.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring individual tree crown characteristics is an important component of smart agriculture and is crucial for orchard management. We focused on understanding how UAV imagery taken across one growing season can help understand and predict the growth and development of pistachio trees grown from rootstock seedlings. Tree crown characteristics (i.e., height, size, shape, and mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) were derived using an object-based image analysis method with multispectral Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery flown seven times over 472 five-year-old pistachio trees in 2018. These imagery-derived metrics were compared with field-collected tree characteristics (tree height, trunk caliper, crown height, width and volume, and leaf development status) collected over two months in 2018. The UAV method captured seasonal development of tree crowns well. UAV-derived tree characteristics were better correlated with the field tree characteristics when recorded between May and November, with high overall correlations in November. The highest correlation (R2 = 0.774) was found between trunk caliper and June UAV crown size. The weakest correlations between UAV and field traits were found in March and December. Spring leaf development stage was most variable, and mean NDVI values were lowest in March, when leaf development starts. Mean NDVI increased orchard-wide by May, and was consistently high through November. This study showcased the benefits of timely, detailed drone imagery for orchard managers.",

        "abstract": "Several species in the oomycete genus Peronosclerospora cause downy mildew on maize and can result in significant yield losses in Asia. Bio-surveillance of these pathogens is a high priority to prevent epidemics on maize in the United States and consequent damage to the US economy. The unresolved taxonomy and dearth of molecular resources for Peronosclerospora spp. hinder these efforts. P. sorghi is a pathogen of sorghum and maize with a global distribution, for which limited diversity has been detected in the southern USA. We characterized the genome, transcriptome, and mitogenome of an isolate, representing the US pathotype 6. The highly homozygous genome was assembled using 10× Genomics linked reads and scaffolded using Hi-C into 13 chromosomes. The total assembled length was 303.2 Mb, larger than any other oomycete previously assembled. The mitogenome was 38 kb, similar in size to other oomycetes, although it had a unique gene order. Nearly 20,000 genes were annotated in the nuclear genome, more than described for other downy mildew causing oomycetes. The 13 chromosomes of P. sorghi were highly syntenic with the 17 chromosomes of Peronospora effusa with conserved centromeric regions and distinct chromosomal fusions. The increased assembly size and gene count of P. sorghi is due to extensive retrotransposition, resulting in putative pseudogenization. Ancestral genes had higher transcript abundance and were enriched for differential expression. This study provides foundational resources for analysis of Peronosclerospora and comparisons to other oomycete genera. Further genomic studies of global Peronosclerospora spp. will determine the suitability of the mitogenome, ancestral genes, and putative pseudogenes for marker development and taxonomic relationships.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the basis of hybrid vigor remains a key question in crop breeding and improvement, especially for rootstock development where F1 hybrids are extensively utilized. Full-sibling UCB-1 F1 seedling rootstocks are widely planted in commercial pistachio orchards that are generated by crossing 2 highly heterozygous outbreeding parental trees of Pistacia atlantica (female) and P. integerrima (male). This results in extensive phenotypic variability, prompting costly removal of low-yielding small trees. To identify the genetic basis of this variability, we assembled chromosome-scale genome assemblies of the parental trees of UCB-1. We genotyped 960 UCB-1 trees in an experimental orchard for which we also collected multiyear phenotypes. We genotyped an additional 1,358 rootstocks in 6 commercial pistachio orchards and collected single-year tree-size data. Genome-wide single marker association tests identified loci associated with tree size and shape, sex, and precocity. In the experimental orchard, we identified multiple trait-associated loci and a strong candidate for ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes. We found significant marker associations unique to different traits and to early vs late phenotypic measures of the same trait. We detected 2 loci strongly associated with rootstock size in commercial orchards. Pseudo-testcross classification of markers demonstrated that the trait-associated alleles for each locus were segregating in the gametes of opposite parents. These 2 loci interact epistatically to generate the bimodal distribution of tree size with undesirable small trees observed by growers. We identified candidate genes within these regions. These findings provide a foundational resource for marker development and genetic selection of vigorous pistachio UCB-1 rootstock.",

        "abstract": "Eleven new major resistance genes for lettuce downy mildew were introgressed from wild Lactuca species and mapped to small regions in the lettuce genome. Downy mildew, caused by the oomycete pathogen Bremia lactucae Regel, is the most important disease of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The most effective method to control this disease is by using resistant cultivars expressing dominant resistance genes (Dm genes). In order to counter changes in pathogen virulence, multiple resistance genes have been introgressed from wild species by repeated backcrosses to cultivated lettuce, resulting in numerous near-isogenic lines (NILs) only differing for small chromosome regions that are associated with resistance. Low-pass, whole genome sequencing of 11 NILs was used to identify the chromosome segments introgressed from the wild donor species. This located the candidate chromosomal positions for resistance genes as well as additional segments. F2 segregating populations derived from these NILs were used to genetically map the resistance genes to one or two loci in the lettuce reference genome. Precise knowledge of the location of new Dm genes provides the foundation for marker-assisted selection to breed cultivars with multiple genes for resistance to downy mildew.",

        "abstract": "The period of heightened volcanic and seismic activity at Kīlauea volcano on the island of Hawai’i, USA from late spring through summer 2018 included a remarkable quasi-periodic sequence of caldera collapse events. From mid-May to early-August, 62 collapse events, each releasing the seismic energy equivalent of a Mw 5.0 ± 0.4 earthquake, occurred about every 1–2 days with over 300 M ≥ 2.5 earthquakes between sequential collapses. This region, experiencing very high rates of seismicity and frequent large magnitude events, is a good candidate to apply a regional seismic hazard assessment. Nowcasting is a type of statistical analysis that uses small magnitude events to estimate the occurrence of large magnitude events. This is done utilizing the concept of natural time in which time is counted by small magnitude event occurrences between large magnitude events, not in clock time (days passed). This method has produced a “nowcasted” set of large earthquakes that are in good agreement with the actual cataloged events in prior studies analyzing non-volcanic regions. Previously applied to tectonic earthquakes and induced seismicity over longer time frames, this is the first test of nowcasting large caldera collapse events in volcanic associated seismicity and on a relatively short time scale. The technique produced limited “success” nowcasting 37 collapse events that agreed with the catalog of actual events. A temporal dependence of successful nowcasting during the sequence was found that may correlate to previously identified and analyzed physical changes in the volcanic system.",

        "abstract": "Nowcasting is a term originating from economics, finance, and meteorology. It refers to the process of determining the uncertain state of the economy, markets or the weather at the current time by indirect means. In this paper, we describe a simple two-parameter data analysis that reveals hidden order in otherwise seemingly chaotic earthquake seismicity. One of these parameters relates to a mechanism of seismic quiescence arising from the physics of strain-hardening of the crust prior to major events. We observe an earthquake cycle associated with major earthquakes in California, similar to what has long been postulated. An estimate of the earthquake hazard revealed by this state variable time series can be optimized by the use of machine learning in the form of the Receiver Operating Characteristic skill score. The ROC skill is used here as a loss function in a supervised learning mode. Our analysis is conducted in the region of 5° × 5° in latitude-longitude centered on Los Angeles, a region which we used in previous papers to build similar time series using more involved methods (Rundle & Donnellan, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001097; Rundle, Donnellan et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EA001757; Rundle, Stein et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6633/abf893). Here we show that not only does the state variable time series have forecast skill, the associated spatial probability densities have skill as well. In addition, use of the standard ROC and Precision (PPV) metrics allow probabilities of current earthquake hazard to be defined in a simple, straightforward, and rigorous way.",

        "abstract": "The last 12 months have provided further evidence of the potential for cascading ecological and socio-political crises that were warned of 12 months ago. Then a consensus statement from the Regional Action on Climate Change Symposium warned: \"the Earth's climatic, ecological, and human systems are converging towards a crisis that threatens to engulf global civilization within the lifetimes of children now living.\" Since then, the consequences of a broad set of extreme climate events (notably droughts, floods, and fires) have been compounded by interaction with impacts from multiple pandemics (including COVID-19 and cholera) and the Russia-Ukraine war. As a result, new connections are becoming visible between climate change and human health, large vulnerable populations are experiencing food crises, climate refugees are on the move, and the risks of water, food, and climate disruption have been visibly converging and compounding. Many vulnerable populations now face serious challenges to adapt. In light of these trends, this year, RACC identifies a range of measures to be taken at global and regional levels to bolster the resilience of these populations in the face of such emerging crises. In particular, at all scales, there is a need for globally available local data, reliable analytic techniques, community capacity to plan adaptation strategies, and the resources (scientific, technical, cultural, and economic) to implement them. To date, the rate of growth of the support for climate change resilience lags behind the rapid growth of cascading and converging risks. As an urgent message to COP27, it is proposed that the time is now right to devote much greater emphasis, global funding, and support to the increasing adaptation needs of vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Land subsidence caused by excessive groundwater pumping in Central Valley, California, is a major issue that has several negative impacts such as reduced aquifer storage and damaged infrastructures which, in turn, produce an economic loss due to the high reliance on crop production. This is why it is of utmost importance to routinely monitor and assess the surface deformation occurring. Two main goals that this paper attempts to accomplish are deformation characterization and deformation prediction. The first goal is realized through the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to a series of Interferomtric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images that produces eigenimages displaying the key characteristics of the subsidence. Water storage changes are also directly analyzed by the use of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The second goal is accomplished by building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict short-term deformation after developing an InSAR time series using LiCSBAS, an open-source InSAR time series package. The model is applied to the city of Madera and produces better results than a baseline averaging model and a one dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a mean squared error metric showing the effectiveness of machine learning in deformation prediction as well as the potential for incorporation in hazard mitigation models. The model results can directly aid policy makers in determining the appropriate rate of groundwater withdrawal while maintaining the safety and well-being of the population as well as the aquifers’ integrity.",

        "abstract": "Yes. Plain Language Summary The question of whether earthquake occurrence is random in time, or perhaps chaotic with order hidden in the chaos, is of major importance to the determination of risk from these events. It was shown many years ago that if aftershocks are removed from the earthquake catalogs, what remains are apparently events that occur at random time intervals, and therefore not predictable in time. In the present work, we enlist machine learning methods using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. With these methods, probabilities of large events and their associated information value can be computed. Here information value is defined using Shannon entropy, shown by Claude Shannon to define the surprise value of a communication such as a string of computer bits. Random messages can be shown to have high entropy, surprise value, or uncertainty, whereas low entropy is associated with reduced uncertainty and high reliability. An earthquake nowcast probability associated with reduced uncertainty and greater reliability is most desirable. Examples of the latter could be the statements that there is a 90% probability of a major earthquake within 3 years, or a 5% chance of a major earthquake within 1 year. Despite the random intervals between major earthquakes, we find that it is possible to make low uncertainty, high reliability statements on current hazard by the use of machine learning methods using catalog data from 1970-present.",

This paper describes the development of an open-source containerized RISC-V based game console emulator that replaced physical hardware for use in course projects. The tool was initially designed and used in a graduate operating systems course and then subsequently used in a lower division computer organization and machine-dependent programming course. The container provides a full toolchain with gcc compiler, RISC-V game console emulator with integrated debugger, example program, and input recording/auto-run tool designed for auto-grading. The use of a container reduced the barrier to entry for the students allowing them to get up and running in a relatively short period of time. Given the successful deployment of the tool in the previous courses, the tool was used both again in the lower division course and in the upper division undergraduate operating systems course this past fall.",

Combining students of differing skill levels into a single course can have negative impact on the classroom experience making some students feel inadequate compared to their peers. Prior to 2018, our large four-year R1 research university in the United States had a single lower-division programming sequence. Since only a single sequence existed all students (both majors and non-majors) were grouped together in the same courses. In this paper we analyze the impact of developing a dual lower division programming course sequence and deploying a placement exam. Our analysis tracks student performance in upper division courses over the first five years of the dual track programming course sequence, and we present the performance difference based upon the particular track the students take.",

Many applications do not lend themselves well to an event-based approach, but preemptive multithreading pre-allocates resources that cannot be used even while not in use by the owning thread. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach called Y-Threads. Y-Threads provide separate small stacks for blocking portions of applications, while allowing for shared stacks for non-blocking computations. We have implemented Y-Threads on Mica and Telos wireless sensor network platforms. The results show that Y-Threads provide a preemptive multithreaded programming model with resource utilization closer to an event-based approach. In addition, relatively large memory buffers can be allocated for temporary use with less overhead than conventional dynamic memory allocation methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive control deficits are associated with impaired executive functioning in schizophrenia. The Dual Mechanisms of Control framework suggests that proactive control requires sustained dorsolateral prefrontal activity, whereas reactive control marshals a larger network. However, primate studies suggest these processes are maintained by dual-encoding regions. To distinguish between these theories, we compared the distinctiveness of proactive and reactive control functional neuroanatomy. In a reanalysis of data from a previous study, 47 adults with schizophrenia and 56 controls completed the Dot Pattern Expectancy task during an fMRI scan examining proactive and reactive control in frontoparietal and medial temporal regions. Areas suggesting specialized control or between-group differences were tested for association with symptoms and task performance. Elastic net models additionally explored these areas' predictive abilities regarding performance. Most regions were active in both reactive and proactive control. However, evidence of specialized proactive control was found in the left middle and superior frontal gyri. Control participants showed greater proactive control in the left middle and right inferior frontal gyri. Elastic net models moderately predicted task performance and implicated various frontal gyri regions in control participants, with additional involvement of anterior cingulate and posterior parietal regions for reactive control. Elastic nets for patient participants implicated the inferior and superior frontal gyri, and posterior parietal lobe. Specialized cognitive control was unassociated with either performance or schizophrenia symptomatology. Future work is needed to clarify the distinctiveness of proactive and reactive control, and its role in executive deficits in severe psychopathology.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: For over 30 years, combined research and treatment settings in the US have been critical to conceptualizing care for first-episode psychosis (FEP). Here we describe an early example of such a context, the Services for the Treatment of Early Psychosis (STEP) clinic, which is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh. METHODS: We describe STEP's historical roots and establishment in the early 1990s; STEP's research and treatment contributions, alongside its growth and ongoing leadership. RESULTS: Research-based clinics, like STEP, preceded and helped pave the way for the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode project in the US and the ensuing Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) approach, now widely adopted in the US. Early clinic-based research at STEP helped establish protocols for psychopharmacology, the relevance of effective early treatment, including psychosocial approaches, and highlighted disparities in treatment outcomes across race/ethnicity. Multidisciplinary collaboration and dialogue with consumers contributed to early treatment, combining psychosocial and pharmacological approaches. STEP adopted CSC and is situated within a bi-state Learning Health System. STEP has retained a relatively unique 5-year treatment model and exists within continuum of care ideally suited to studying psychotic illness and treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: STEP remains the largest academic FEP clinic in Pennsylvania. Academic FEP clinics like STEP will have a critical role within Learning Health Systems nationally to model participatory approaches, sustain early intervention treatment quality and ongoing treatment developments.",

        "abstract": "Neuroimaging plays a crucial role in understanding brain structure and function, but the lack of transparency, reproducibility, and reliability of findings is a significant obstacle for the field. To address these challenges, there are ongoing efforts to develop reporting checklists for neuroimaging studies to improve the reporting of fundamental aspects of study design and execution. In this review, we first define what we mean by a neuroimaging reporting checklist and then discuss how a reporting checklist can be developed and implemented. We consider the core values that should inform checklist design, including transparency, repeatability, data sharing, diversity, and supporting innovations. We then share experiences with currently available neuroimaging checklists. We review the motivation for creating checklists and whether checklists achieve their intended objectives, before proposing a development cycle for neuroimaging reporting checklists and describing each implementation step. We emphasize the importance of reporting checklists in enhancing the quality of data repositories and consortia, how they can support education and best practices, and how emerging computational methods, like artificial intelligence, can help checklist development and adherence. We also highlight the role that funding agencies and global collaborations can play in supporting the adoption of neuroimaging reporting checklists. We hope this review will encourage better adherence to available checklists and promote the development of new ones, and ultimately increase the quality, transparency, and reproducibility of neuroimaging research.",

        "abstract": "The distinction between the concepts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is fundamental to the Kraepelinian tradition in psychiatry. One mechanism undergirding this distinction, a difference in reward sensitivity, has been championed by a number of scholars. As part of the Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical applications for Serious mental illnesses consortium, 225 participants including people with schizophrenia (n = 69), schizoaffective disorder (n = 55), and bipolar affective disorder (n = 53) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task. This task switches the rewarded stimulus at various times throughout the task. Our analyses leveraged a Hidden Markov Model to examine trial-by-trial decisions of participants to reveal the differences between patient groups in their response to reward feedback. Whereas no patient group showed difficulty reversing their preferred categories after a switch in the task's contingencies and bipolar patient performance was spared in some other ways, all patient groups made more errors throughout the task because of a greater tendency to shift away from rewarded categories (i.e., win-switching). Furthermore, patients' cognitive ability is specifically related to this aspect of the task. Rather than validating a Kraepelinian dichotomy, these findings suggest that a failure to exploit rewards may reflect a mechanistic deficit common across both affective and nonaffective psychoses related to cognitive impairments in patients.

        "abstract": "Computational psychiatry aims to quantify individual patients' psychiatric pathology by measuring behavior during psychophysical tasks and characterizing the neurocomputational parameters underlying specific decision-making systems. While this approach has great potential for informing us about specific computational processes associated with psychopathology, the fundamental psychometric properties of computational assessments remain understudied. Optimizing these psychometric properties, including test-retest reliability, is essential for clinical utility. To address this gap, we assessed the test-retest reliability of manifest behavior and computational model parameters of a probabilistic reward and reversal learning task, two-armed Bandit, using intraclass correlations (ICCs) in 179 adults, including those with various psychosis-spectrum disorders and undiagnosed controls. We studied two computational models from recent literature: regression modeling of choice strategies and a hidden Markov model. The test-retest reliability for both manifest behavior (0.24 ≤ ICCs ≤ 0.54) and computational parameters (0.30 ≤ ICCs ≤ 0.61) ranged from poor to moderate, which was not explained by practice effects. Computational parameters did not outperform manifest behavior parameters. The reliability of computational parameters was generally-though not significantly-higher in healthy adults, which may potentially reflect the internal heterogeneity of categorical psychiatric diagnoses. Computational modeling holds promise, but tasks and analyses must be optimized for greater reliability before proceeding into clinical use.

        "abstract": "Background: Given the increased attention to functional improvement in spine surgery as it relates to motion preservation, activities of daily living, and cost, it is critical to fully understand the healthcare economic impact of new devices being tested in large FDA randomized controlled trials (RCT). The purpose of this analysis was to comprehensively evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the novel Total Posterior Spine (TOPS™) System investigational device compared with the trial control group, standard transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of TOPS™ compared with TLIF. Methods: The study patient population was extracted from a multicenter RCT with current enrollment at n=121 with complete 1-year follow-up. The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness, expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcomes were health-related utility, presented as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost, calculated in US dollars. Analysis was conducted following Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness Health and Medicine recommendations. The base case analysis utilized SF-36 survey data from the RCT. Both cost and QALY outcomes were discounted at a yearly rate of 3% to reflect their present value. A cohort Markov model was constructed to analyze perioperative and postoperative costs and QALYs for both TOPS™ and control groups. Scenario, probabilistic, and threshold sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine model discrimination and calibration. Results: The primary time horizon used to estimate cost and health utility was 2 years after index surgery. From a health system perspective, assuming a 50/50 split between Medicare and private payers, the TOPS™ cohort is cost-effective 2 years postoperatively ($6158/QALY) compared with control. At 6 years and beyond, TOPS™ becomes dominant, irrespective of payer mix and surgical setting. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $100 000/QALY, 63% of all 5000 input parameter simulations favor TOPS, even with a $4000 upcharge vs TLIF. Discussion: The novel TOPS™ device is cost-effective compared with TLIF and becomes the dominant economic strategy over time. Conclusions: In the emerging, rapidly expanding field of value-based medicine, there will be an increased demand for these analyses, ensuring surgeons are empowered to make the best, most sustainable solutions for their patients and society.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the increased attention to functional improvement in spine surgery as it relates to activities of daily living and cost, it is critical to fully understand the health care economic impact of enabling technologies. The use of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IOM) during spine surgery has long been controversial. Questions pertaining to utility, medico-legal considerations, and cost-effectiveness continue to be unresolved. The purpose of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness by assessing quality-of-life due to adverse events averted, decreased postoperative pain, decreased revision rates, and improved patient reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: The study patient population was extracted from a large multicenter database collected by a single, national IOM provider. Over 50,000 patient charts were abstracted and included in this analysis. The analysis was conducted in accordance with the second panel on cost-effectiveness health and medicine. Health-related utility was derived from questionnaire answers and expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Both cost and QALY outcomes were discounted at a yearly rate of 3% to reflect their present value. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for IOM. A value under the commonly accepted United States-based willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY was considered cost-effective. Scenario (including litigation), probabilistic (PSA), and threshold sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine model discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: The primary time horizon used to estimate cost and health utility was 2-years following index surgery. On average, index surgery for patients with IOM costs are approximately $1,547 greater than non-IOM cases. The base case assumed an inpatient Medicare population however multiple outpatient and payer scenarios were assessed in the sensitivity analysis. From a health system perspective IOM is cost-effective, yielding better utilities but at a higher cost than the non-IOM strategy (ICER $60,734 per QALY). From a societal perspective the IOM strategy was dominant, suggesting that better outcomes were achieved at less cost. Except for an entirely privately insured population, alternative scenarios such as, outpatient and a 50:50 Medicare/privately insured population sample also demonstrated cost-effectiveness. Notably, IOM benefits were unable to overcome the sheer costs associated many litigation scenarios, but the data was severely limited. In the 5,000 iteration PSA, at a WTP of $100,000, 74% of simulations using IOM were cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IOM in spine surgery is cost-effective in most scenarios examined. In the emerging and rapidly expanding field of value-based medicine, there will be an increased demand for these analyses, ensuring surgeons are empowered to make the best, most sustainable solutions for their patients and the health care system.",

        "abstract": "The injectable progestin depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is a popular contraceptive choice in sub-Saharan Africa although mouse models indicate it weakens genital epithelial integrity and barrier function and increases susceptibility to genital infection. The intravaginal ring NuvaRing® is another contraceptive option that like DMPA suppresses hypothalamic pituitary ovarian (HPO) axis function with local release of progestin (etonogestrel) and estrogen (ethinyl estradiol). As we previously reported that treating mice with DMPA and estrogen averts the loss of genital epithelial integrity and barrier function induced by DMPA alone, in the current investigation we compared genital levels of the cell-cell adhesion molecule desmoglein-1 (DSG1) and genital epithelial permeability in rhesus macaques (RM) treated with DMPA or a NuvaRing®re-sized for RM (N-IVR). While these studies demonstrated comparable inhibition of the HPO axis with DMPA or N-IVR, DMPA induced significantly lower genital DSG1 levels and greater tissue permeability to intravaginally administered low molecular mass molecules. By identifying greater compromise of genital epithelial integrity and barrier function in RM administered DMPA vs. N-IVR, our results add to the growing body of evidence that indicate DMPA weakens a fundamental mechanism of anti-pathogen host defense in the female genital tract.",

To further evaluate the risk of virus transmission, tissues were obtained from deceased donors who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via nasopharyngeal swab. This study evaluated an array of human tissues recovered for transplantation, including bone, tendon, skin, fascia lata, vascular tissues, and heart valves. Tissue samples and plasma or serum samples, if available, were tested for viral RNA (vRNA) using a real time PCR system for the presence of virus RNA. All samples were tested in quadruplicate for both subgenomic (sgRNA) and genomic (gRNA) RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene. Amplification of a cellular housekeeping gene served as the positive control for every sample. A total of 47 tissue samples from 17 donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Four donors had plasma or serum available for paired testing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from any tissue or plasma/serum sample tested. Based on these findings, risk of transmission through the transplantation of tissue types studied from SARS-CoV-2 infected donors is likely to be low.",

Anti-Envelope antibodies have been considered critical for protection against SIV/HIV (SHIV) acquisition. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of an SHIV vaccine against SIVmac251 challenge, where the role of antibody was excluded, as there was no cross-reactivity between SIV and SHIV envelope antibodies. After 8 low-dose intrarectal challenges with SIVmac251, 12 SHIV-vaccinated animals demonstrated efficacy, compared with 6 naive controls, suggesting protection was achieved in the absence of anti-envelope antibodies. Interestingly, CD8+ T cells (and some NK cells) were not essential for preventing viral acquisition, as none of the CD8-depleted macaques were infected by SIVmac251 challenges. Initial investigation of protective innate immunity revealed that protected animals had elevated pathways related to platelet aggregation/activation and reduced pathways related to interferon and responses to virus. Moreover, higher expression of platelet factor 4 on circulating platelet-leukocyte aggregates was associated with reduced viral acquisition. Our data highlighted the importance of innate immunity, identified mechanisms, and may provide opportunities for novel HIV vaccines or therapeutic strategy development.",

In monkeys inoculated simultaneously with SIVmac239Deltavpx/Deltavpr and SIVmac239Deltanef, recombinant wild-type (wt) virus and wild-type levels of plasma viral RNA (vRNA) were detected in blood by 2 weeks postinoculation. In monkeys inoculated first with SIVmac239Deltavpx/Deltavpr and then with SIVmac239Deltanef, recombination occurred but was associated with lower plasma vRNA levels than plasma vRNA levels seen for monkeys inoculated intravaginally with wt SIVmac239. In one monkey, recombination occurred 6 weeks after the challenge with SIVmac239Deltanef when plasma SIVmac239Deltavpx/Deltavpr RNA levels were undetectable. In monkeys inoculated first with the more highly replicating strain, SIVmac239Deltanef, and then with SIVmac239Deltavpx/Deltavpr, wild-type recombinant virus was not detected in blood or tissues. Instead, a virus that had repaired the deletion in the nef gene by a compensatory mutation was found in one animal. Overall, recombinant SIV was eventually found in four of six animals intravaginally inoculated with the two SIVmac239 deletion mutants. These findings show that recombination can occur readily in vivo after mucosal SIV exposure and thus contributes to the generation of viral genetic diversity and enhancement of viral fitness.",

We analyzed 8% of PKC mutations identified in human cancers and found that, surprisingly, most were loss of function and none were activating. Loss-of-function mutations occurred in all PKC subgroups and impeded second-messenger binding, phosphorylation, or catalysis. Correction of a loss-of-function PKCβ mutation by CRISPR-mediated genome editing in a patient-derived colon cancer cell line suppressed anchorage-independent growth and reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model. Hemizygous deletion promoted anchorage-independent growth, revealing that PKCβ is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression. Several mutations were dominant negative, suppressing global PKC signaling output, and bioinformatic analysis suggested that PKC mutations cooperate with co-occurring mutations in cancer drivers. These data establish that PKC isozymes generally function as tumor suppressors, indicating that therapies should focus on restoring, not inhibiting, PKC activity.",

        "abstract": "The rapidly growing field of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) basic and translational research requires standardization of terminology and functional characterization. The International Standards Organization's (ISO) Technical Committee (TC) on Biotechnology, working with extensive input from the International Society for Cells and Gene Therapy (ISCT), has recently published ISO standardization documents that are focused on biobanking of MSCs from two tissue sources, Wharton's Jelly, MSC(WJ) and Bone Marrow, MSC(M)), for research and development purposes and development. This manuscript explains the path towards the consensus on the following two documents: the Technical Standard ISO/TS 22859 for MSC(WJ) and the full ISO Standard 24651 for MSC(M) biobanking. The ISO standardization documents are aligned with ISCT's MSC committee position and recommendations on nomenclature because there was active input and incorporation of ISCT MSC committee recommendations in the development of these standards. The ISO standardization documents contain both requirements and recommendations for functional characterization of MSC(WJ) and MSC(M) using a matrix of assays. Importantly, the ISO standardization documents have a carefully defined scope and are meant for research use of culture expanded MSC(WJ) and MSC(M). The ISO standardization documents can be updated in a revision process and will be systematically reviewed after 3-5 years as scientific insights grow. They represent international consensus on MSC identity, definition, and characterization; are rigorous in detailing multivariate characterization of MSCs and represent an evolving-but-important first step in standardization of MSC biobanking and characterization for research use and development.",

Follow-up blood samples were collected from all patients (pts) for testing by T2 and companion BC (cBC). T2 was run-in batch at a central lab; results are reported qualitatively for three groups of spp. (Candida albicans/C. tropicalis (CA/CT), C. glabrata/C. krusei (CG/CK), or C. parapsilosis (CP)). T2 and cBC were defined as positive (+) if they detected a sp. identified in dBC.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>152 patients were enrolled (median age: 54 yrs (18–93); 54% (82) men). Candidemia risk factors included indwelling catheters (82%, 125), abdominal surgery (24%, 36), transplant (22%, 33), cancer (22%, 33), hemodialysis (17%, 26), neutropenia (10%, 15). Mean times to Candida detection/spp. identification by dBC were 47/133 hours (2/5.5 d). dBC revealed CA (30%, 46), CG (29%, 45), CP (28%, 43), CT (11%, 17) and CK (3%, 4). Mean time to collection of T2/cBC was 62 hours (2.6 d). 74% (112) of patients received antifungal (AF) therapy prior to T2/cBC (mean: 55 hours (2.3 d)). Overall, T2 results were more likely than cBC to be + (P &amp;lt; 0.0001; Table), a result driven by performance in AF-treated patients (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). T2 was more likely to be + among patients originally infected with CA (61% (28) vs. 20% (9); P = 0.001); there were trends toward higher positivity in patients infected with CT (59% (17) vs. 23% (4; P = 0.08) and CP (42% (18) vs. 28% (12); P = 0.26).

        "abstract": "Isavuconazole is the newest of the clinically available advanced generation triazole antifungals and is active against a variety of yeasts, molds, and dimorphic fungi. Its current FDA-approved indications include the management of invasive aspergillosis as well as mucormycosis, though the latter indication is supported by limited clinical data. Isavuconazole did not achieve noninferiority to caspofungin for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and therefore lacks an FDA-approved indication for this invasive disease. Significant advantages of isavuconazole, primarily over voriconazole but in some circumstances posaconazole as well, make it an appealing option for the management of complex patients with invasive fungal infections. These potential advantages include lack of QTc interval prolongation, more predictable pharmacokinetics, a less complicated drug interaction profile, and improved tolerability, particularly when compared to voriconazole. This review discusses these topics in addition to addressing the in vitro activity of the compound against a variety of fungi and provides insight into other distinguishing factors among isavuconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole. The review concludes with an opinion section in which the authors provide the reader with a framework for the current role of isavuconazole in the antifungal armamentarium and where further data are required.",

        "abstract": "There are still many limitations related to the understanding of the natural history of differing forms of coccidioidomycosis (CM), including characterizing the spectrum of pulmonary disease. The historical Veterans Administration-Armed Forces database, recorded primarily before the advent of antifungal therapy, presents an opportunity to characterize the natural history of pulmonary CM. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 342 armed forces service members who were diagnosed with pulmonary CM at VA facilities between 1955 to 1958, followed through 1966, who did not receive antifungal therapy. Patients were grouped by predominant pulmonary finding on chest radiographs. The all-cause mortality was low for all patients (4.6%). Cavities had a median size of 3-3.9 cm (IQR: 2-2.9-4-4.9 cm), with heterogeneous wall thickness and no fluid level, while nodules had a median size of 1-1.19 cm (Interquartile range [IQR] 1-1.9-2-2.9 cm) and sharp borders. The majority of cavities were chronic (85.6%), and just under half were found incidentally. Median complement fixation titers in both the nodular and cavitary groups were negative, with higher titers in the cavitary group overall. This retrospective cohort study of non-disseminated coccidioidomycosis, the largest to date, sheds light on the natural history, serologic markers, and radiologic characteristics of this understudied disease. These findings have implications for the evaluation and management of CM.",

        "abstract": "Recently discovered polyhedral structures of the value function for finite discounted Markov decision processes (MDP) shed light on understanding the success of reinforcement learning. We investigate the value function polytope in greater detail and characterize the polytope boundary using a hyperplane arrangement. We further show that the value space is a union of finitely many cells of the same hyperplane arrangement, and relate it to the polytope of the classical linear programming formulation for MDPs. Inspired by these geometric properties, we propose a new algorithm, Geometric Policy Iteration (GPI), to solve discounted MDPs. GPI updates the policy of a single state by switching to an action that is mapped to the boundary of the value function polytope, followed by an immediate update of the value function. This new update rule aims at a faster value improvement without compromising computational efficiency. Moreover, our algorithm allows asynchronous updates of state values which is more flexible and advantageous compared to traditional policy iteration when the state set is large. We prove that the complexity of GPI achieves the best known bound O||over 1 - γlog 1 over 1-γof policy iteration and empirically demonstrate the strength of GPI on MDPs of various sizes.",

        "abstract": "Circuit-augmentation algorithms are generalizations of the simplex method, where in each step one is allowed to move along a fixed set of directions, called circuits, that is a superset of the edges of a polytope. We show that in the circuit-augmentation framework the greatest-improvement and Dantzig pivot rules are NP-hard, already for 0/1-LPs. Differently, the steepest-descent pivot rule can be carried out in polynomial time in the 0/1 setting, and the number of circuit augmentations required to reach an optimal solution according to this rule is strongly polynomial for 0/1-LPs. The number of circuit augmentations has been of interest as a proxy for the number of steps in the simplex method, and the circuit-diameter of polyhedra has been studied as a lower bound to the combinatorial diameter of polyhedra. Extending prior results, we show that for any polyhedron P the circuit-diameter is bounded by a polynomial in the input bit-size of P. This is in contrast with the best bounds for the combinatorial diameter of polyhedra. Interestingly, we show that the circuitaugmentation framework can be exploited to make novel conclusions about the classical simplex method itself: In particular, as a byproduct of our circuit results, we prove that (i) computing the shortest (monotone) path to an optimal solution on the 1-skeleton of a polytope is NP-hard, and hard to approximate within a factor better than 2, and (ii) for 0/1 polytopes, a monotone path of strongly polynomial length can be constructed using steepest improving edges.",

An example is birdwatching. Suppose we can observe up to m different types of birds during a season. At any moment a bird of type i is observed with some probability. There are many natural questions a birdwatcher may have: how many observations should one expect to perform before recording all types of birds? Is there a time interval where the researcher is most likely to observe all species? Or, what is the likelihood that several species of birds will be observed at overlapping time intervals? Our paper answers these questions using a new model based on random interval graphs. This model is a natural follow up to the famous coupon collector’s problem.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the analysis of the performance of the simplex method, we study the behavior of families of pivot rules of linear programs. We introduce normalized-weight pivot rules which are fundamental for the following reasons: First, they are memory-less, in the sense that the pivots are governed by local information encoded by an arborescence. Second, many of the most used pivot rules belong to that class, and we show this subclass is critical for understanding the complexity of all pivot rules. Finally, normalized-weight pivot rules can be parametrized in a natural continuous manner. The latter leads to the existence of two polytopes, the pivot rule polytopes and the neighbotopes, that capture the behavior of normalized-weight pivot rules on polytopes and linear programs. We explain their face structure in terms of multi-arborescences and compute upper bounds on the number of coherent arborescences, that is, vertices of our polytopes. We introduce a normalized-weight pivot rule, called the max-slope pivot rule, which generalizes the shadow-vertex pivot rule. The corresponding pivot rule polytopes and neighbotopes refine the monotone path polytopes of Billera and Sturmfels. Our constructions are important beyond optimization and provide new perspectives on classical geometric combinatorics. Special cases of our polytopes yield permutahedra, associahedra, and multiplihedra. For the greatest-improvement pivot rules we draw connections to sweep polytopes and polymatroids.",

Given a pair (P, φ) of a polytope P and a linear functional φ , the MPP is obtained from averaging the fibers of the projection φ(P) . They also showed that MPPs of (regular) simplices and hyper-cubes are combinatorial cubes and permutahedra respectively. As a natural follow-up we investigate the monotone paths of cross-polytopes for a generic linear functional φ . We show the face lattice of the MPP of the cross-polytope is isomorphic to the lattice of intervals in the sign poset from oriented matroid theory. We also describe its f-vector, some geometric realizations, an irredundant inequality description, the 1-skeleton and we compute its diameter.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if methotrexate or folic acid prescription was associated with differential risk for COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality. DESIGN: Case-control analysis. SETTING: The population-based UK Biobank (UKBB) cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Data from 380 380 UKBB participants with general practice prescription data for 2019-2021. Updated medical information was retrieved on 13 December 2021. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19-related mortality were analysed by multivariable logistic regression. Exposures evaluated were prescription of folic acid and/or methotrexate. Criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis were (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or (2) ICD-10 code for confirmed COVID-19 (U07.1) or probable COVID-19 (U07.2) in hospital records, or death records. By these criteria, 26 003 individuals were identified with COVID-19 of whom 820 were known to have died from COVID-19. Logistic regression statistical models were adjusted for age sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, body mass index, smoking status, presence of rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell disease, use of anticonvulsants, statins and iron supplements. RESULTS: Compared with people prescribed neither folic acid nor methotrexate, people prescribed folic acid supplementation had increased risk of diagnosis of COVID-19 (OR 1.51 (1.42-1.61)). The prescription of methotrexate with or without folic acid was not associated with COVID-19 diagnosis (p≥0.18). People prescribed folic acid supplementation had positive association with death after a diagnosis of COVID-19 (OR 2.64 (2.15-3.24)) in a fully adjusted model. The prescription of methotrexate in combination with folic acid was not associated with an increased risk for COVID-19-related death (1.07 (0.57-1.98)). CONCLUSIONS: We report an association of increased risk for COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19-related death in people prescribed folic acid supplementation. Our results also suggest that methotrexate might attenuate these associations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory arthritis in which the immune system targets synovial joints. Methotrexate serves as the mainstay of treatment for RA due to its efficacy. However, patients treated with methotrexate are uniquely at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia due to coincident disease risk factors and the fact that methotrexate use is associated with malabsorption. The objective of this study was to assess for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with RA treated with methotrexate and folic acid. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 50 patients with RA treated with methotrexate and folic acid and 49 patients with RA treated with other therapies. Patients were matched by age, sex, race, renal function, and disease activity. We compared plasma vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels between these two groups utilizing quantitative and categorical analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (74%) RA patients on methotrexate and folic acid had elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared with only 27 (55%) RA patients receiving other therapies (P < 0.05). The proportion of patients with low vitamin B12 and high methylmalonic acid levels did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show high plasma homocysteine levels among RA patients treated with methotrexate and folic acid. While plasma vitamin B12 levels were similar between the two groups, high plasma homocysteine is also a sensitive marker of vitamin B12 deficiency. Additional studies should evaluate for the presence of clinical features of vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia among RA patients treated with methotrexate and folic acid.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient that is not made by plants; consequently, unfortified plant-based foods are not a reliable supply. Recent estimates suggest high rates of vitamin B12 deficiency among the vegetarian and vegan populations, particularly in pregnant women or women of child-bearing age who, for ethical and health reasons, are shifting towards higher consumption of plant-based foods in ever-increasing numbers. Vitamin B12 plays crucial metabolic roles across the life-course and in particular during pregnancy and in early development (first 1000 days of life). Evidence now implicates vitamin B12 deficiency with increased risk to a range of neuro, vascular, immune, and inflammatory disorders. However, the current UK recommended nutrient intake for vitamin B12 does not adequately consider the vitamin B12 deficit for those choosing a plant-based diet, including vegetarianism and in particular veganism, representing a hidden hunger. We provide a cautionary note on the importance of preventing vitamin B12 deficits for those individuals choosing a plant-based diet and the health professionals advising them.",

Perfusion studies in Sturge-Weber syndrome by single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography generally demonstrate hypoperfusion in the diseased tissue. We report perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging results in 2 cases of Sturge-Weber syndrome with recent seizures. The affected cerebral tissue showed increased relative cerebral blood flow and volume with prolonged mean transit time and time to peak. Elevated relative cerebral blood flow could be attributed to seizures, whereas increased relative cerebral blood volume might have resulted from vasodilation due to seizure activity or chronic ischemia. These findings point to the variable results of functional studies in Sturge-Weber syndrome that might lead to miscalculations of the lesion area before surgery.",

METHODS: Twenty-six AD, 22 MCI and 15 normal cognitive status (NCS) patients were scanned with a 3 Tesla MR scanner. Hippocampus volumes were detected manually by Osiris 4.18. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis, which was performed to adjust the covariate effects of education, age, gender, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, showed that hippocampal atrophy was correlated with AD and MCI for right hippocampus; AD, MCI and age for left hippocampus independent of other parameters. A second regression analysis revealed that MMSE was correlated with hippocampal volume. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal volumetry can be used in early diagnosis of cognitive impairment, as well as grading cognitive decline.",

        "abstract": "While much attention was paid to the interactions of human-driven and automated vehicles at the microscopic level in recent years, the understanding of the macroscopic properties of mixed autonomy traffic flow still remains limited. In this paper, we present an equilibrium model of traffic flow with mixed autonomy based on the theory of two-player games. We consider self-interested traffic agents (i.e. human-driven and automated vehicles) endowed with different speed functions and interacting with each other simultaneously in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions. We propose a two-player game model to encapsulate their interactions and characterize the equilibria the agents may reach. We show that the model admits two types of Nash equilibria, one of which is always Pareto efficient. Based on this equilibrium structure, we propose a speed policy that guarantees the realized equilibria are Pareto efficient in all traffic regimes. We present two examples to illustrate the applications of this model. In one example, we construct flux functions for mixed autonomy traffic based on behavior characteristics of agents. In the other example, we consider a lane policy and show that mixed autonomy traffic may exhibit counterintuitive behaviors even though all the agents are rational.",

        "abstract": "Many places around the world periodically suffer from wildfires that threaten lives and disrupt normal traffic operations. Poor traffic performance during wildfires can inhibit the effectiveness of evacuations. Understanding traffic performance during a wildfire would therefore help transportation operators develop emergency traffic control plans. In this study, we developed a traffic speed and flow prediction model that uses support vector regression (SVR), for use during wildfire incidents. This was constructed using historical data for wildfires in California from 2010 to 2019, which were paired with records of the traffic speed and flow on adjacent highways and the prevailing weather conditions during the wildfire events. The results showed that traffic performance during a wildfire could be predicted using the SVR model. Based on our prediction results, we recommend that policies be implemented to encourage or mandate more detailed data collection of wildfire events, such as the fire’s boundary over time, to facilitate better prediction results in models like the one proposed in this paper. This paper should inspire further work on the topic to improve the model and provide a reliable prediction tool for transportation operators in the future.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular emissions and traffic congestion have been deteriorated by highly urbanization. The worsen traffic burdens drivers with a higher cost and longer time on driving, and exposures pedestrians to unhealthy emissions such as PM, NO_{x}, SO_{2} and greenhouse gases. In response to these issues, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which enable information sharing between vehicles and infrastructure was proposed. With CAVs and advanced wireless technologies offering extremely low latency, platooning control can be realized to reduce the traffic delay, fuel consumption and emissions by improving traffic efficiency. However, conventional platooning control algorithms require complex computations and hence, are not a perfect candidate when applying to real-time operations. To overcome this issue, this work focuses on designing an innovative learning framework for platooning control capable of reducing the traffic delay and fuel consumption by the four basic platoon manipulations, e.g., split, acceleration, deceleration, and no-op. We integrate reinforcement learning (RL) with neural networks (NNs) to be able to model non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs for a complex application. The experimental results reveal decreasing trends of the delay and fuel usage and a growing trend of the reward. They demonstrate that the proposed DRL platooning control optimizes the average delay and fuel consumption by fine-tuning speeds and sizes of platoons.",

The leading vehicle moves with constant speed in the experiment. The following vehicles consist of six programmable AVs and different number of HVs. Thus, the market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs decreases with the increase of platoon size. The constant time gap car-following policy is adopted for the AVs and the gap is set to 1.5 s. The experiment shows that in the 7-vehicle-platoon, the oscillations grow only slightly. In the 10-vehicle-platoon, the AVs could still significantly suppress the growth of oscillations. With the further decrease of MPR of AVs in the 13- and 20-vehicle-platoon, the AVs become having no significant impact on oscillation growth. On the other hand, the flow rate of mixed platoons is lower than that of All-HV platoons of the same size. A simulation study is carried out, which exhibits good agreement with the experiment.",

        "abstract": "A road network can be represented as a weighted directed graph with the nodes being the traffic intersections, the edges being the road segments, and the weights being some attribute of a road segment. Such a representation enables researchers to analyze road networks in consistent and automatable ways from the perspectives of graph theory. For example, analysis of the graph along with the traffic demand pattern can identify critical road segments based on centrality measures. However, due to the complexity of real-world road networks and the computationally expensive algorithms, it is challenging to extend the such methods to a large-scale road network. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient network simplification framework based on graph theory that sub-samples and simplifies the graph while preserving key topological characteristics in the original network. Our method iteratively identifies and removes network elements that do not contribute to transportation functionality, such as self-loops, dead-ends, and interstitial nodes that lies on the same road line. We applied this method to three small cities with distinct street patterns and one large city, and showed that topological characteristics in the original networks are preserved by comparing two distinct kinds of centrality distributions in the original and simplified networks.",

Although challenging to study in nature, this process may be particularly apparent in novel environments such as cities. We document abundant evidence of plastic behavioral changes in urban animals, including learning, contextual, developmental, and transgenerational plasticities. Using behavioral drive as a conceptual framework, our analysis of notable case studies suggests that plastic behaviors, such as altered habitat use, migration, diurnal and seasonal activity, and courtship, can have faciliatory and cascading effects on urban evolution via spatial, temporal, and mate-choice mechanisms. Our findings highlight (i) the need to incorporate behavioral plasticity more formally into urban evolutionary research and (ii) the opportunity provided by urban environments to study behavioral mechanisms of plasticity-led processes.",

        "abstract": "The social environment is a key factor that influences behavioural traits across a wide array of species. Yet, when investigating individual differences in behaviour, studies tend to measure animals in isolation from other conspecifics-even in social species. Surprisingly, whether behavioural traits measured in isolation are predictive of individual-level behaviour when in social groups is still poorly understood. Here, we repeatedly measured risk-taking behaviour (i.e. boldness; 741 total trials) in both the presence and absence of conspecifics in a social lizard, the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). Further, we manipulated food availability during group trials to test whether the effect of the social environment on risk-taking behaviour was mediated by competition over resources. Using 105 lizards collected from three independent populations, we found that individual risk-taking behaviour was repeatable when measured in either social isolation or within groups both with and without food resources available. However, lizards that were bolder during individual trials were not also bolder when in groups, regardless of resource availability. This was largely driven by individual differences in social behavioural plasticity, whereby individual skinks responded differently to the presence of conspecifics. Together, this resulted in a rank order change of individual behavioural types across the social conditions. Our results highlight the importance of the social environment in mediating animal personality traits across varying levels of resource availability. Further, these findings suggest that behavioural traits when measured in isolation, may not reflect individual variation in behaviour when measured in more ecologically realistic social groups.",

        "abstract": "Biological invasions are a multi-stage process (i.e., transport, introduction, establishment, spread), with each stage potentially acting as a selective filter on traits associated with invasion success. Behavior (e.g., exploration, activity, boldness) plays a key role in facilitating species introductions, but whether invasion acts as a selective filter on such traits is not well known. Here we capitalize on the well-characterized introduction of an invasive lizard (Lampropholis delicata) across three independent lineages throughout the Pacific, and show that invasion shifted behavioral trait means and reduced among-individual variation-two key predictions of the selective filter hypothesis. Moreover, lizards from all three invasive ranges were also more behaviorally plastic (i.e., greater within-individual variation) than their native range counterparts. We provide support for the importance of selective filtering of behavioral traits in a widespread invasion. Given that invasive species are a leading driver of global biodiversity loss, understanding how invasion selects for specific behaviors is critical for improving predictions of the effects of alien species on invaded communities.",

One underexplored feature that could drive variation in response to traps is social context. We looked at how group size influences the behaviour of western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, group members, including eating novel foods. Individuals in larger groups were faster to recover after experiencing a predator cue and faster to feed on known food items. Moreover, fish in larger groups were more likely to try novel foods, including microplastics, a common evolutionary trap. We also found evidence of a group level behavioural syndrome, in which a consistent proportion of individuals performed a behaviour across assays (i.e. resumed general activity following a predator cue, ate known food and ate novel food). Our results provide evidence that group size can influence the severity of an evolutionary trap and that, regardless of group size, group identity can have a strong effect on individual behaviour.",

We discuss why fear generalization should be ecologically important, and why we expect fear to correlate across disparate dangers. CIDs in fear are well studied for some dangers in some taxa (e.g., human fear of pathogens), but not well studied for most dangers.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a carrageenan-induced inflammatory model in the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) using weight-bearing load, rotational perch locomotion, thermal threshold withdrawal, and footpad dimensions. ANIMALS: 16 adult cockatiels (8 males and 8 females). PROCEDURES: Cockatiels were randomly assigned into 2 groups as either treatment (carrageenan injection; n = 8) or control (handling only; 8). Treatment of cockatiels involved unilateral subcutaneous injection of 0.05 mL of 1% lambda carrageenan solution into the left footpad. Control birds were handled in a similar manner without an injection. Following baseline measurements and treatment or control procedures, posttreatment measurements at multiple time points involving weight-bearing perch load (for up to 336 hours), locomotive abilities when placed on a rotating perch (for up to 96 hours), thermal withdrawal threshold (for the 24- to 30-hour period), and both vertical and horizontal left footpad size and degree of swelling (for up to 84 days) were obtained. RESULTS: Treatment cockatiels had a significant decrease in left foot weight-bearing load and increase in left footpad dimensions and swelling grade over time compared to control cockatiels. Rotational perch locomotion and thermal withdrawal threshold, conversely, did not differ significantly between groups. Cockatiels injected with carrageenan returned to normal weight-bearing within 2 weeks; however, left footpad dimensions did not return to baseline. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Carrageenan footpad injection prompts a measurable and grossly visible inflammatory response in the cockatiel. Additionally, it induces alterations in weight-bearing distribution in injected birds. This model provides a method to evaluate inflammation and lameness in small psittacine species.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare cardiopulmonary variables and blood gas analytes in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) during anesthesia with and without abdominal carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation at intra-abdominal pressures (IAPs) 4 and 6 mmHg, with and without endotracheal intubation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective experimental trial. ANIMALS: A total of six intact female Hartley guinea pigs. METHODS: A crossover study with sequence randomization for IAP and intubation status was used. The animals were sedated with intramuscular midazolam (1.5 mg kg-1) and buprenorphine (0.2 mg kg-1) and anesthetized with isoflurane, and an abdominal catheter was inserted for CO2 insufflation. Animals with endotracheal intubation were mechanically ventilated and animals maintained using a facemask breathed spontaneously. After 15 minutes of insufflation, the following variables were obtained at each IAP: pulse rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2 (intubated only), peak inspiratory pressure (intubated only), noninvasive blood pressure and blood gas and electrolyte values, with a rest period of 5 minutes between consecutive IAPs. After 4 weeks, the procedure was repeated with the guinea pigs assigned the opposite intubation status. RESULTS: Intubated guinea pigs had significantly higher pH and lower partial pressure of CO2 in cranial vena cava blood (PvCO2) than nonintubated guinea pigs. An IAP of 6 mmHg resulted in a significantly higher PvCO2 (65.9 ± 19.0 mmHg; 8.8 ± 2.5 kPa) than at 0 (53.2 ± 17.2 mmHg; 7.1 ± 2.3 kPa) and 4 mmHg (52.6 ± 10.8 mmHg; 7.01 ± 1.4 kPa), mean ± standard deviation, with intubated and nonintubated animals combined. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although the oral anatomy of guinea pigs makes endotracheal intubation difficult, capnoperitoneum during anesthesia induces marked hypercapnia in the absence of mechanical ventilation. An IAP of 4 mmHg should be further evaluated for laparoscopic procedures in guinea pigs because hypercapnia may be less severe than with 6 mmHg.",

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective experimental study. ANIMALS: A total of 10 New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.6 ± 0.3 kg (mean ± standard deviation). METHODS: Rabbits anesthetized with sevoflurane were intubated with an uncuffed endotracheal tube (3.0 mm internal diameter) and adequate seal. For Pe'CO2, the sidestream capnometer sampling adapter or the mainstream capnometer was placed between the endotracheal tube and Bain breathing system (1.5 L minute-1 oxygen). PaCO2 was obtained from arterial blood collected every 5 minutes. A time-cycled ventilator delivered an inspiratory time of 1 second and 12 or 20 breaths minute-1. Peak inspiratory pressure was initially set to achieve Pe'CO2 normocapnia of 35-45 mmHg (4.6-6.0 kPa). A total of five paired Pe'CO2 and PaCO2 measurements were obtained with each ventilation mode for each capnometer. Anesthetic episodes were separated by 7 days. Agreement was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis and linear mixed models; p < 0.05. RESULTS: There were 90 and 83 pairs for the mainstream and sidestream capnometers, respectively. The mainstream capnometer underestimated PaCO2 by 12.6 ± 2.9 mmHg (proportional bias 0.44 ± 0.06 mmHg per 1 mmHg PaCO2 increase). With the sidestream capnometer, ventilation mode had a significant effect on Pe'CO2.

However, lipoprotein analysis by standard laboratory analyzers or an indirect method, such as the Friedewald formula, has not been validated in parrots. A research colony of 12 Quaker parrots (Myiopsitta monachus) were used to compare plasma values from the Roche Cobas c501 biochemistry analyzer for total cholesterol, total triglycerides, LDL, and HDL to gel-permeation high-performance liquid chromatography (GP-HPLC). To increase sample size and broaden the analytical range to include dyslipidemic samples, 2 cross-over studies were performed on a 0.3% cholesterol diet and a 20% fat diet. Agreement between methods was assessed by linear mixed models and Bland and Altman plots. The LDL concentrations calculated by the Friedewald formula and alternative formulas, and the effects of triglycerides on the biases, were also evaluated. Forty-five plasma samples were used. The cholesterol diet induced a marked increase in cholesterol and all lipoproteins, whereas the fat diet did not lead to dyslipidemia. Direct and indirect LDL measurements obtained with the clinical analyzer were not in clinical agreement with GP-HPLC, whereas HDL had acceptable agreement for normotriglyceridemic samples. Hypertriglyceridemic plasma samples were found to interfere with lipoprotein measurements. This study found LDL measured by the Roche Cobas c501 biochemistry analyzer and indirect estimations cannot be recommended in the Quaker parrot, and non-HDL cholesterol should be used instead. Lipoprotein panels obtained from hypertriglyceridemic samples should be interpreted with care.",

        "abstract": "Research on cancer in dogs and cats, among other diseases, finds an important source of information in registry data collected from hospitals. These sources have proved to be decisive in establishing incidences and identifying temporal patterns and risk factors. However, the attendance of patients is not random, so the correct delimitation of the hospital catchment area (CA) as well as the identification of the factors influencing its shape is relevant to prevent possible biases in posterior inferences. Despite this, there is a lack of data-driven approaches in veterinary epidemiology to establish CA. Therefore, our aim here was to apply a Bayesian method to estimate the CA of a hospital. We obtained cancer (n = 27,390) and visit (n = 232,014) registries of dogs and cats attending the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital of the University of California, Davis from 2000 to 2019 with 2,707 census tracts (CTs) of 40 neighboring counties. We ran hierarchical Bayesian models with different likelihood distributions to define CA for cancer cases and visits based on the exceedance probabilities for CT random effects, adjusting for species and period (2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, and 2015-2019). The identified CAs of cancer cases and visits represented 75.4 and 83.1% of the records, respectively, including only 34.6 and 39.3% of the CT in the study area. The models detected variation by species (higher number of records in dogs) and period. We also found that distance to hospital and average household income were important predictors of the inclusion of a CT in the CA. Our results show that the application of this methodology is useful for obtaining data-driven CA and evaluating the factors that influence and predict data collection. Therefore, this could be useful to improve the accuracy of analysis and inferences based on registry data.",

Here, we describe the pre-clinical profile of OMX-4.80P, demonstrating it is well tolerated, long-lasting in circulation and tumors, and it penetrates deep into tumor tissue reducing hypoxia and altering hypoxic phenotype by downregulating HIF-1 pathway. Furthermore, it dramatically enhances RT leading to tumor cures. METHODS: We assessed the ability of OMX-4.80P to penetrate tumor tissue and reduce hypoxia in multiple orthotopic and immunocompetent mouse and rat models of glioblastoma and other tumors as well as in spontaneous canine brain tumors in veterinary patients. We measured the efficacy of OMX-4.80P in NSCLC tumors (H460 and Calu 6), and its activity in intracranial glioblastoma models in nude mice (U251), immunocompetent rats (F98) and in spontaneous canine brain tumors. We assessed exogenous hypoxia markers (pimonidazole and CCI-103F) and hypoxia inducible transcriptional factor HIF-1 by IHC and ELISA, and HIF-1 downstream targets by IHC and qRT PCR. We also conducted toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies in mice, rats and in naïve and oncology patient dogs. RESULTS: In xenograft studies of large, hypoxic, radioresistant tumors, single doses of OMX-4.80P in combination with RT result in apparent tumor cures in ∼30-50% of tumors compared to 0% cures in RT-only groups. We observed good penetration into mouse and rat intracranial and subcutaneous tumors (∼1 cm3), and into spontaneous canine brain tumors, that resulted in hypoxia reduction, as assessed by OxyLite pO2 probe and pimonidazole and CCI-103F, leading to downregulation of the HIF-1 pathway. Observed dramatic drop in HIF-1α, VEGF, GLUT-1 and PDL-1 levels suggests OMX-4.80P has profound effects on tumor cell phenotype beyond radiosensitization. Pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies using single or multiple supratherapeutic and therapeutic doses of OMX-4.80P in rodents and dogs demonstrated that it has a circulation half-life of ∼20h in rats and ∼30-40h in dogs, and that it is well tolerated. Finally, OMX-4.80P has no detectable immunogenic response. CONCLUSIONS: The preclinical data demonstrating hypoxia reduction, HIF-1 pathway downregulation and radiation enhancement, and promising PK and toxicology profile of OMX-4.80P support its clinical development as a radiosensitizer for multiple types of hypoxic tumors. Furthermore, its ability to alter key downstream effectors of the HIF-1 pathway suggest it may have potential to alter tumor biology and enhance patient responses to variety of targeted and chemo therapies by affecting tumor drug resistance, immune responsiveness, angiogenesis, metabolism and invasion.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Ana Krtolica, Natacha Le Moan, Jen Getz, Tina Davis, Sarah Ng, Catherine Bedard, Andrew Davis, Philberta Leung, Laura Serwer, Kevin Tanaka, Tim Keating, Feng Yan, Teri Guerrero, Michael Kent, Peter Dickinson, Jonathan Winger, Stephen P.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We evaluated the kinetics of the hypoxia PET radiotracers, [18F]fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) and [18F]fluoroazomycin-arabinoside ([18F]FAZA), for tumor hypoxia detection and to assess the correlation of hypoxic kinetic parameters with static imaging measures in canine spontaneous tumors. METHODS: Sixteen dogs with spontaneous tumors underwent a 150-min dynamic PET scan using either [18F]FMISO or [18F]FAZA. The maximum tumor-to-muscle ratio (TMRmax) > 1.4 on the last image frame was used as the standard threshold to determine tumor hypoxia. The tumor time-activity curves were analyzed using irreversible and reversible two-tissue compartment models and graphical methods. TMRmax was compared with radiotracer trapping rate (k 3), influx rate (K i), and distribution volume (V T). RESULTS: Tumor hypoxia was detected in 7/8 tumors in the [18F]FMISO group and 4/8 tumors in the [18F]FAZA group. All hypoxic tumors were detected at > 120 min with [18F]FMISO and at > 60 min with [18F]FAZA. [18F]FAZA showed better fit with the reversible model. TMRmax was strongly correlated with the irreversible parameters (k 3 and K i) for [18F]FMISO at > 90 min and with the reversible parameter (V T) for [18F]FAZA at > 120 min. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that [18F]FAZA provided a promising alternative radiotracer to [18F]FMISO with detecting the presence of tumor hypoxia at an earlier time (60 min), consistent with its favorable faster kinetics. The strong correlation between TMRmax over the 90-150 min and 120-150 min timeframes with [18F]FMISO and [18F]FAZA, respectively, with kinetic parameters associated with tumor hypoxia for each radiotracer, suggests that a static scan measurement (TMRmax) is a good alternative to quantify tumor hypoxia.

Estrogen receptors (ER-∝, ER-β), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR), have been previously identified on human osteosarcoma (OSA) cells, and are considered to influence tumor growth, but their expression and role in canine OSA is unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize sex hormone receptor expression levels in naturally occurring OSA tissue and in three canine OSA cell lines. The expression of ER-α, ER-β, PR, and AR was investigated using RT-PCR. PR expression levels were also quantified in OSA cells cultured under hypoxic conditions or in the presence of estradiol. The effects of progesterone on cell proliferation were quantified. Results demonstrated varying expression levels of these receptors in five OSA subtypes. OSA cell lines demonstrated high gene expression levels of PR and low gene expression levels of ER-α and ER-β and no gene expression of AR. PR expression was increased in OSA cells cultured under hypoxic conditions in a HIF-∝ independent manner. Interestingly, one cell line expressed very high levels of PR, expression of which decreased in response to estradiol. In addition, progesterone decreased OSA cell proliferation in this particular cell line. Further investigation of the role of sex steroids, particularly PR and its ligands, in regulation of canine OSA is recommended.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Weeds are a significant barrier to rice production in California, exacerbated by lack of chemical control options and herbicide-resistance in persistent aquaphilic species. Oxyfluorfen-tolerant rice, created at the Rice Experiment Station (RES) in Biggs, California, was developed to provide an agronomic program for managing problematic grass and sedge rice-weeds including Oryza sativa f. spontanea Roshev. (weedy 'red' rice). Hand-pulling is the most common removal method for O. sativa spontanea because there are no herbicides registered for this pest in California. Oxyfluorfen was used in combination with oxyfluorfen-tolerant rice in 2019 and 2021 field studies to evaluate rice injury and weed control efficacy on prevalent rice-weed species. Additional studies were conducted in 2021 on University of California Davis campus to determine pre-emergent oxyfluorfen efficacy on four California O. sativa spontanea accessions. RESULTS: Fields studies indicated minimal crop injury in the first 28 days after seeding (DAS), but no observable injury at 60 DAS in both years. Weed control with oxyfluorfen alone was 87% or greater for all weeds rated with the exception of Schoenoplectus mucronatus (L.) Palla (ricefield bulrush), and Leptochloa fascicularis (Lam.) A. Gray (bearded sprangletop) in both years. All O. sativa spontanea exposed to soil-applied oxyfluorfen successfully emerged through the soil surface, but became completely necrotic 28 days after flooding. CONCLUSION: Oxyfluorfen-tolerant rice system was demonstrated to be a viable management strategy for California rice growers who struggle with grass- and sedge-weed control as well as provide a novel herbicide option for California O. sativa spontanea management. © 2022 University of California, Davis.

        "abstract": "Background: Non-transgenic chemical mutagen application, particularly ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), is an important tool to create mutations and gain a new genetic makeup for plants. It is useful to obtain a sufficient number of mutant plants instead of working with a severe mutation in a few plants. EMS dose and exposure period have been previously studied in several crops; however, EMS used to create point mutations in presoaked rice seeds has not been sufficiently studied and there is no standard protocol for such treatment. The aim of this study is to establish a standard protocol for EMS mutagenesis application in rice. Methods: Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of four durations of rice seed presoaking (0, 6, 12, and 24 hours), four EMS concentration doses (0.0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%), and four EMS exposure periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 hours). Germination rate, plumula and radicle length, seedling survival, LD 50 (Lethal Dose) determination, shoot length, root length and fresh seedling weight were evaluated. Results: Results showed that a 12-hour presoaking duration, 0.5% EMS dose, and six hours of EMS exposure were the best practices for the optimum number of mutant plants. Conclusions: In light of both this study and the literature, a standard application protocol was established. This application protocol, detailed in this article, contains the following guidelines: (1) Presoaking: 12 hours, (2) EMS application: 0.5% dose EMS and six hours, (3) Final washing: six hours, (4) Drying: 72 hours at 38°C. A user-friendly protocol has been presented for utilization by researchers.",

Photosystem reactions involving water oxidation were inhibited more than other reactions, and chlorophyll fluorescence transients indicated most inhibition was on the photooxidizing side of photosystem II. Injury was influenced little by the order in which the stresses were imposed and was always most severe when they were combined. Release of proteins from thylakoid membranes was not detected. Lability to the stresses was lowest in thylakoids from vegetative stage plants and increased as plants matured. We concluded that thermal injury is accentuated by high PAR, the two stresses may act at a common site near the water oxidizing complex, and their interaction may be involved in photosynthetic decline during adverse conditions.",

        "abstract": "High temperature stress adversely affects wheat growth in many important production regions, but the mode of injury is unclear. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Newton) was grown under controlled conditions to determine the relative magnitude and sequences of responses of source and sink processes to high temperature stress during grain development. Regimes of 25°C day/15°C night, 30°C day/20°C night, and 35°C day/25°C night from 5 days after anthesis to maturity differentially affected source and sink processes. High temperatures accelerated the normal decline in viable leaf blade area and photosynthetic activities per unit leaf area. Electron transport, as measured by Hill reaction activity, declined earlier and faster than other photosynthetic processes at the optimum temperature of 25/15 °C and at elevated temperatures. Changes in RUBP carboxylase activities were similar in direction but smaller in magnitude than changes in photosynthesic rate. Increased protease activity during senscence was markedly accentuated by high temperature stress. Specific protease activity increased 4‐fold at 25/15 °C and 28‐fold at 35/25 °C from 0 to 21 days after initiation of temperature treatments. Grain‐filling rate decreased from the lowest to the highest temperature, but the change was smaller than the decrease in grain‐filling duration at the same temperatures. We concluded that a major effect of high temperature is acceleration of senescence, including cessation of vegetative and reproductive growth, deterioration of photosynthetic activities, and degradation of proteinaceous constituents.

        "abstract": "This investigation determined whether thylakoid proteins would be degraded more rapidly or not in senescing wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell.) leaves concurrently exposed to high temperatures. Excised leaves were pulse‐labelled with [ 35 S]‐methionine for a 12 h period, and then incubated at 22,32 or 42°C for 0, 1, 2, or 3 d, before extracting a thylakoid enriched membrane sample. After electrophoretic separation, two prominent [ 35 S]‐labelled protein bands were chosen for further analyses. Band A contained the D‐1 thylakoid protein and band B contained thylakoid proteins of the light harvesting complex (LHCII) associated with photosystem II (PSII). Total protein, [ 35 S]‐labelled protein, band A protein, and band B protein within the thylakoid enriched membrane samples were measured. Unlabelled thylakoid enriched membrane samples, extracted from leaves given similar treatments, were used to measure uncoupled whole‐chain and photosystem II (PSII) electron transport and chlorophyll fluorescence. Accentuated decline in whole‐chain and PSII electron transport, increasing F o values, and decreasing F max values were a result of high temperature injury in leaves treated at 42°C. None of the thylakoid enriched membrane protein fractions were degraded more rapidly in high‐temperature treated leaves. Degradation of the total [ 35 S]‐labelled membrane proteins and band B was inhibited by the 42°C treatment. The results indicate that high temperature stress may disrupt some aspects of normal senescence. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",

        "abstract": "Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used in food-producing animals, including chickens in an extralabel manner. This study aimed to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for meloxicam in broiler chickens and laying hens to facilitate withdrawal interval (WDI) estimations. The model structure for broiler chickens contained six compartments including plasma, muscle, liver, kidney, fat and rest of body, while an additional compartment of ovary was included for laying hens. The model adequately simulated available pharmacokinetic data of meloxicam in plasma of broiler chickens as well as tissue and egg data of laying hens. The model was converted to a web-based interface and used to predict WDIs following extralabel administrations. The results showed that the estimated WDIs were 50, 44, 11, 3, 3, 22 and 4 days for liver, kidney, muscle, fat, ovary, yolk and white, respectively in laying hens after 14 repeated oral administrations of meloxicam (1 mg/kg) at 24-h intervals. This model provides a useful and flexible tool for risk assessment and management of residues for meat and eggs from chickens treated with meloxicam and will serve as a basis for extrapolation to other NSAID drugs and other poultry species to aid animal-derived food safety assessment.",

        "abstract": "Avian pox is a common avian virus that in its cutaneous form can cause characteristic lesions on a bird's dermal surfaces. Detection of avian pox in free-ranging birds historically relied on observations of visual lesions and/or histopathology, both which can underestimate avian pox prevalence. We compared traditional visual observation methods for avian pox with molecular methods that utilize minimally invasive samples (blood, toenail clipping, feathers, and dermal swabs) in an ecologically important group of birds, hummingbirds. Specifically, avian pox prevalence in several species of hummingbirds were examined across multiple locations using three different methods: (1) visual inspection of hummingbirds for pox-like lesions from a long-term banding data set, (2) qPCR assay of samples from hummingbird carcasses from wildlife rehabilitation centers, and (3) qPCR assay of samples from live-caught hummingbirds. A stark difference in prevalences among these three methods was identified, with an avian pox prevalence of 1.5% from banding data, 20.4% from hummingbird carcasses, and 32.5% from live-caught hummingbirds in California. This difference in detection rates underlines the necessity of a molecular method to survey for avian pox, and this study establishes one such method that could be applied to other wild bird species. Across all three methods, Anna's hummingbirds harbored significantly higher avian pox prevalence than other species examined, as did males compared with females and birds caught in Southern California compared with Northern California. After hatch-year hummingbirds also harbored higher avian pox prevalences than hatch-year hummingbirds in the California banding data set and the carcass data set. This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of avian pox in hummingbirds and address the ecology of this hummingbird-specific strain of avian pox virus, providing vital information to inform future studies on this charismatic and ecologically important group of birds.",

A secondary objective was to obtain pilot data regarding the efficacy of CCFA for improving foal survival in mares with placentitis. Twelve pregnant pony mares were enrolled in the study, inoculated with Streptococcus zooepidemicus, intracervically and assigned to one of three groups: CEFT (n = 3; administered CCFA only; 6.6 mg/kg, i.m., q96h); COMBO (n = 6; administered combination therapy of CCFA, altrenogest, and pentoxifylline); UNTREAT (n = 3, no treatment). Treatment was initiated at the onset of clinical signs. Concentrations of desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DCA), the acetamide derivative of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur metabolites, were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Maximum and minimum serum concentrations of DCA at steady state in treated mares were 2.40±0.40 μg/mL and 1.06±0.29 μg/mL, respectively. Concentration of DCA in colostrum was 1.51±0.60 μg/mL. DCA concentrations in placenta and fetal tissues were very low (median = 0.03 μg/mL) and below the minimum inhibitory concentration of relevant pathogens. DCA was not detected in amniotic fluid or foal serum. Treatment did not appear to improve foal survival (CEFT: 0/3; COMBO: 2/6; UNTREAT: 2/3). Bacteria were recovered from the uterus of most mares postpartum and from blood cultures of most foals regardless of treatment.",

Issues relating to prognostic factors were coordinated by a workgroup who identified tumor morphotype, sarcomatoid/rhabdoid differentiation, tumor necrosis, grading, and microvascular invasion as potential prognostic parameters. There was consensus that the main morphotypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were of prognostic significance, that subtyping of papillary RCC (types 1 and 2) provided additional prognostic information, and that clear cell tubulopapillary RCC was associated with a more favorable outcome. For tumors showing sarcomatoid or rhabdoid differentiation, there was consensus that a minimum proportion of tumor was not required for diagnostic purposes. It was also agreed upon that the underlying subtype of carcinoma should be reported. For sarcomatoid carcinoma, it was further agreed upon that if the underlying carcinoma subtype was absent the tumor should be classified as a grade 4 unclassified carcinoma with a sarcomatoid component. Tumor necrosis was considered to have prognostic significance, with assessment based on macroscopic and microscopic examination of the tumor. It was recommended that for clear cell RCC the amount of necrosis should be quantified. There was consensus that nucleolar prominence defined grades 1 to 3 of clear cell and papillary RCCs, whereas extreme nuclear pleomorphism or sarcomatoid and/or rhabdoid differentiation defined grade 4 tumors. It was agreed upon that chromophobe RCC should not be graded. There was consensus that microvascular invasion should not be included as a staging criterion for RCC.",

        "abstract": "The International Society of Urologic Pathology 2012 Consensus Conference on renal cancer, through working group 3, focused on the issues of staging and specimen handling of renal tumors. The conference was preceded by an online survey of the International Society of Urologic Pathology members, and the results of this were used to inform the focus of conference discussion. On formal voting a ≥65% majority was considered a consensus agreement. For specimen handling it was agreed that with radical nephrectomy specimens the initial cut should be made along the long axis and that both radical and partial nephrectomy specimens should be inked. It was recommended that sampling of renal tumors should follow a general guideline of sampling 1 block/cm with a minimum of 3 blocks (subject to modification as needed in individual cases). When measuring a renal tumor, the length of a renal vein/caval thrombus should not be part of the measurement of the main tumor mass. In cases with multiple tumors, sampling should include at a minimum the 5 largest tumors. There was a consensus that perinephric fat invasion should be determined by examining multiple perpendicular sections of the tumor/perinephric fat interface and by sampling areas suspicious for invasion. Perinephric fat invasion was defined as either the tumor touching the fat or extending as irregular tongues into the perinephric tissue, with or without desmoplasia. It was agreed upon that renal sinus invasion is present when the tumor is in direct contact with the sinus fat or the loose connective tissue of the sinus, clearly beyond the renal parenchyma, or if there is involvement of any endothelium-lined spaces within the renal sinus, regardless of the size. When invasion of the renal sinus is uncertain, it was recommended that at least 3 blocks of the tumor-renal sinus interface should be submitted. If invasion is grossly evident, or obviously not present (small peripheral tumor), it was agreed that only 1 block was needed to confirm the gross impression. Other recommendations were that the renal vein margin be considered positive only when there is adherent tumor visible microscopically at the actual margin. When a specimen is submitted separately as \"caval thrombus,\" the recommended sampling strategy is to take 2 or more sections to look for the adherent caval wall tissue. It was also recommended that uninvolved renal parenchyma be sampled by including normal parenchyma with tumor and normal parenchyma distant from the tumor. There was consensus that radical nephrectomy specimens should be examined for the purpose of identifying lymph nodes by dissection/palpation of the fat in the hilar area only; however, it was acknowledged that lymph nodes are found in <10% of radical nephrectomy specimens.",

        "abstract": "The classification working group of the International Society of Urological Pathology consensus conference on renal neoplasia was in charge of making recommendations regarding additions and changes to the current World Health Organization Classification of Renal Tumors (2004). Members of the group performed an exhaustive literature review, assessed the results of the preconference survey and participated in the consensus conference discussion and polling activities. On the basis of the above inputs, there was consensus that 5 entities should be recognized as new distinct epithelial tumors within the classification system: tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), acquired cystic disease-associated RCC, clear cell (tubulo) papillary RCC, the MiT family translocation RCCs (in particular t(6;11) RCC), and hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC syndrome-associated RCC. In addition, there are 3 rare carcinomas that were considered as emerging or provisional new entities: thyroid-like follicular RCC; succinate dehydrogenase B deficiency-associated RCC; and ALK translocation RCC. Further reports of these entities are required to better understand the nature and behavior of these highly unusual tumors. There were a number of new concepts and suggested modifications to the existing World Health Organization 2004 categories. Within the clear cell RCC group, it was agreed upon that multicystic clear cell RCC is best considered as a neoplasm of low malignant potential. There was agreement that subtyping of papillary RCC is of value and that the oncocytic variant of papillary RCC should not be considered as a distinct entity. The hybrid oncocytic chromophobe tumor, which is an indolent tumor that occurs in 3 settings, namely Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome, renal oncocytosis, and as a sporadic neoplasm, was placed, for the time being, within the chromophobe RCC category. Recent advances related to collecting duct carcinoma, renal medullary carcinoma, and mucinous spindle cell and tubular RCC were elucidated. Outside of the epithelial category, advances in our understanding of angiomyolipoma, including the epithelioid and epithelial cystic variants, were considered. In addition, the apparent relationship between cystic nephroma and mixed epithelial and stromal tumor was discussed, with the consensus that these tumors form a spectrum of neoplasia. Finally, it was thought that the synovial sarcoma should be removed from the mixed epithelial and mesenchymal category and placed within the sarcoma group. The new classification is to be referred to as the International Society of Urological Pathology Vancouver Classification of Renal Neoplasia.",

          "Ridesharing is older than horse-and-buggy travel, and recent innovations make sharing easier, more convenient, and more efficient than ever before. Innovative mobility services premised on pooling can lower travel costs, mitigate congestion, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They also offer travelers more mobility choices beyond the traditional bookends of auto ownership and public transit. While the realm of shared mobility is vast, including shared bikes, scooters, and cars, the focus of this chapter is on pooled services-placing more people in a single vehicle. Doing so unlocks huge economic, social, and environmental benefits.",
          "For the first time in half a century, real transformative innovations are coming to our world of passenger transportation. The convergence of new shared mobility services with automated and electric vehicles promises to significantly reshape our lives and communities for the better—or for the worse. The dream scenario could bring huge public and private benefits, including more transportation choices, greater affordability and accessibility, and healthier, more livable cities, along with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The nightmare scenario could bring more urban sprawl, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and unhealthy cities and individuals. In Three Revolutions, transportation expert Dan Sperling, along with seven other leaders in the field, share research–based insights on potential public benefits and impacts of the three transportation revolutions. They describe innovative ideas and partnerships, and explore the role government policy can play in steering the new transportation paradigm toward the public interest—toward our dream scenario of social equity, environmental sustainability, and urban livability. Many factors will influence these revolutions—including the willingness of travelers to share rides and eschew car ownership; continuing reductions in battery, fuel cell, and automation costs; and the adaptiveness of companies. But one of the most important factors is policy. Three Revolutions offers policy recommendations and provides insight and knowledge that could lead to wiser choices by all. With this book, Sperling and his collaborators hope to steer these revolutions toward the public interest and a better quality of life for everyone."

        "abstract": "The 3-30-300 rule offers benchmarks for cities to promote equitable nature access. It dictates that individuals should see three trees from their dwelling, have 30 % tree canopy in their neighborhood, and live within 300 m of a high-quality green space. Implementing this demands thorough measurement, monitoring, and evaluation methods, yet little guidance is currently available to pursue these actions. To overcome this gap, we employed an expert-based consensus approach to review the available ways to measure 3-30-300 as well as each measure's strengths and weaknesses. We described seven relevant data and processes: vegetation indices, street level analyses, tree inventories, questionnaires, window view analyses, land cover maps, and green space maps. Based on the reviewed strengths and weaknesses of each measure, we presented a suitability matrix to link recommended measures with each component of the rule. These recommendations included surveys and window-view analyses for the '3 component', high-resolution land cover maps for the '30 component', and green space maps with network analyses for the '300 component'. These methods, responsive to local situations and resources, not only implement the 3-30-300 rule but foster broader dialogue on local desires and requirements. Consequently, these techniques can guide strategic investments in urban greening for health, equity, biodiversity, and climate adaptation.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Physical and social neighborhood attributes may have implications for children's growth and development patterns. The extent to which these attributes are associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories and obesity risk from childhood to adolescence remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of neighborhood-level measures of opportunity and social vulnerability with trajectories of BMI and obesity risk from birth to adolescence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from 54 cohorts (20 677 children) participating in the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program from January 1, 1995, to January 1, 2022. Participant inclusion required at least 1 geocoded residential address and anthropometric measure (taken at the same time or after the address date) from birth through adolescence. Data were analyzed from February 1 to June 30, 2022. EXPOSURES: Census tract-level Child Opportunity Index (COI) and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) linked to geocoded residential addresses at birth and in infancy (age range, 0.5-1.5 years), early childhood (age range, 2.0-4.8 years), and mid-childhood (age range, 5.0-9.8 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by length [if aged <2 years] or height in meters squared) and obesity (age- and sex-specific BMI ≥95th percentile). Based on nationwide distributions of the COI and SVI, Census tract rankings were grouped into 5 categories: very low (<20th percentile), low (20th percentile to <40th percentile), moderate (40th percentile to <60th percentile), high (60th percentile to <80th percentile), or very high (≥80th percentile) opportunity (COI) or vulnerability (SVI). RESULTS: Among 20 677 children, 10 747 (52.0%) were male; 12 463 of 20 105 (62.0%) were White, and 16 036 of 20 333 (78.9%) were non-Hispanic. (Some data for race and ethnicity were missing.) Overall, 29.9% of children in the ECHO program resided in areas with the most advantageous characteristics. For example, at birth, 26.7% of children lived in areas with very high COI, and 25.3% lived in areas with very low SVI; in mid-childhood, 30.6% lived in areas with very high COI and 28.4% lived in areas with very low SVI. Linear mixed-effects models revealed that at every life stage, children who resided in areas with higher COI (vs very low COI) had lower mean BMI trajectories and lower risk of obesity from childhood to adolescence, independent of family sociodemographic and prenatal characteristics. For example, among children with obesity at age 10 years, the risk ratio was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12-0.34) for very high COI at birth, 0.31 (95% CI, 0.20-0.51) for high COI at birth, 0.46 (95% CI, 0.28-0.74) for moderate COI at birth, and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.32-0.86) for low COI at birth. Similar patterns of findings were observed for children who resided in areas with lower SVI (vs very high SVI). For example, among children with obesity at age 10 years, the risk ratio was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.10-0.30) for very low SVI at birth, 0.20 (95% CI, 0.11-0.35) for low SVI at birth, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.24-0.75) for moderate SVI at birth, and 0.43 (95% CI, 0.24-0.76) for high SVI at birth. For both indices, effect estimates for mean BMI difference and obesity risk were larger at an older age of outcome measurement. In addition, exposure to COI or SVI at birth was associated with the most substantial difference in subsequent mean BMI and risk of obesity compared with exposure at later life stages. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, residing in higher-opportunity and lower-vulnerability neighborhoods in early life, especially at birth, was associated with a lower mean BMI trajectory and a lower risk of obesity from childhood to adolescence. Future research should clarify whether initiatives or policies that alter specific components of neighborhood environment would be beneficial in preventing excess weight in children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research has suggested optimism is associated with healthy aging and exceptional longevity, but most studies were conducted among non-Hispanic White populations. We examined associations of optimism to longevity across racial and ethnic groups and assessed healthy lifestyle as a possible mediating pathway. METHODS: Participants from the Women's Health Initiative (N = 159,255) completed a validated measure of optimism and provided other demographic and health data at baseline. We evaluated associations of optimism with increments in lifespan using accelerated failure time models, and with likelihood of exceptional longevity (survival to age ≥90) using Poisson regression models. Causal mediation analysis explored whether lifestyle-related factors mediated optimism-lifespan associations. RESULTS: After covariate adjustment, the highest versus lowest optimism quartile was associated with 5.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.5, 6.4%) longer lifespan. Within racial and ethnic subgroups, these estimates were 5.1% (95%CI = 4.0, 6.1%) in non-Hispanic White, 7.6% (95%CI = 3.6, 11.7%) in Black, 5.4% (95%CI = -0.1, 11.2%) in Hispanic/Latina, and 1.5% (95% CI = -5.0, 8.5) in Asian women. A high proportion (53%) of the women achieved exceptional longevity. Participants in the highest versus lowest optimism quartile had greater likelihood of achieving exceptional longevity (e.g., full sample risk ratio = 1.1, 95%CI = 1.1, 1.1). Lifestyle mediated 24% of the optimism-lifespan association in the full sample, 25% in non-Hispanic White, 10% in Black, 24% in Hispanic/Latina, and 43% in Asian women. CONCLUSIONS: Higher optimism was associated with longer lifespan and a greater likelihood of achieving exceptional longevity overall and across racial and ethnic groups. The contribution of lifestyle to these associations was modest. Optimism may promote health and longevity in diverse racial and ethnic groups. Future research should investigate these associations in less long-lived populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The extent to which physical and social attributes of neighborhoods play a role in childhood asthma remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of neighborhood-level opportunity and social vulnerability measures with childhood asthma incidence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from children in 46 cohorts participating in the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program between January 1, 1995, and August 31, 2022. Participant inclusion required at least 1 geocoded residential address from birth and parent or caregiver report of a physician's diagnosis of asthma. Participants were followed up to the date of asthma diagnosis, date of last visit or loss to follow-up, or age 20 years. EXPOSURES: Census tract-level Child Opportunity Index (COI) and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) at birth, infancy, or early childhood, grouped into very low (<20th percentile), low (20th to <40th percentile), moderate (40th to <60th percentile), high (60th to <80th percentile), or very high (≥80th percentile) COI or SVI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was parent or caregiver report of a physician's diagnosis of childhood asthma (yes or no). Poisson regression models estimated asthma incidence rate ratios (IRRs) associated with COI and SVI scores at each life stage. RESULTS: The study included 10 516 children (median age at follow-up, 9.1 years [IQR, 7.0-11.6 years]; 52.2% male), of whom 20.6% lived in neighborhoods with very high COI and very low SVI. The overall asthma incidence rate was 23.3 cases per 1000 child-years (median age at asthma diagnosis, 6.6 years [IQR, 4.1-9.9 years]). High and very high (vs very low) COI at birth, infancy, or early childhood were associated with lower subsequent asthma incidence independent of sociodemographic characteristics, parental asthma history, and parity. For example, compared with very low COI, the adjusted IRR for asthma was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00) for high COI at birth and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.71-0.98) for very high COI at birth. These associations appeared to be attributable to the health and environmental and the social and economic domains of the COI. The SVI during early life was not significantly associated with asthma incidence. For example, compared with a very high SVI, the adjusted IRR for asthma was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75-1.02) for low SVI at birth and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.76-1.03) for very low SVI at birth. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort study, high and very high neighborhood opportunity during early life compared with very low neighborhood opportunity were associated with lower childhood asthma incidence. These findings suggest the need for future studies examining whether investing in health and environmental or social and economic resources in early life would promote health equity in pediatric asthma.",

Nature provides pollination of nutritious crops, purification of drinking water, protection from floods, and climate security, among other well-studied health benefits. A crucial, yet challenging, research frontier is clarifying how nature promotes physical activity for its many mental and physical health benefits, particularly in densely populated cities with scarce and dwindling access to nature. Here we frame this frontier by conceptually developing a spatial decision-support tool that shows where, how, and for whom urban nature promotes physical activity, to inform urban greening efforts and broader health assessments. We synthesize what is known, present a model framework, and detail the model steps and data needs that can yield generalizable spatial models and an effective tool for assessing the urban nature-physical activity relationship. Current knowledge supports an initial model that can distinguish broad trends and enrich urban planning, spatial policy, and public health decisions. New, iterative research and application will reveal the importance of different types of urban nature, the different subpopulations who will benefit from it, and nature's potential contribution to creating more equitable, green, livable cities with active inhabitants.",

        "abstract": "Presently, 50% of the human population relies on nitrogen (N) fertilizer for food production. The world today uses around 83 million metric tons of N, which is about a 100-fold increase over the last 100 years. About 60% of global N fertilizer is used for producing the world's three major cereals: rice, wheat, and maize. Projections estimate that 50 to 70% more cereal grain will be required by 2050 to feed 9.3 billion people. This will require increased use of N of similar magnitude if the efficiency with which N is used by the crop is not improved. Fertilizer N-recovery efficiency by the first crop is 30 to 50%. The remaining N either remains in the soil, the recovery of which in the following crops is very limited (<7% of applied N up to six consecutive crops), or it is lost from the soil-plant system, causing serious disruptions in ecosystem functions. Much research has been conducted during the past decades to improve N-use efficiency (NUE) by developing fertilizer management strategies based on a better synchronization between the supply and requirement of N by the crop. Importantly, some of these techniques are being adopted on a large scale by farmers. The two challenges ahead are to (1) improve farmers' knowledge and (2) ensure that these techniques are cost-effective and user-friendly so that they provide attractive options for adoption. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "The demand for nitrogen (N) for crop production increased rapidly from the middle of the twentieth century and is predicted to at least double by 2050 to satisfy the on-going improvements in productivity of major food crops such as wheat, rice and maize that underpin the staple diet of most of the world's population. The increased demand will need to be fulfilled by the two main sources of N supply - biological nitrogen (gas) (N2) fixation (BNF) and fertilizer N supplied through the Haber-Bosch processes. BNF provides many functional benefits for agroecosystems. It is a vital mechanism for replenishing the reservoirs of soil organic N and improving the availability of soil N to support crop growth while also assisting in efforts to lower negative environmental externalities than fertilizer N. In cereal-based cropping systems, legumes in symbiosis with rhizobia contribute the largest BNF input; however, diazotrophs involved in non-symbiotic associations with plants or present as free-living N2-fixers are ubiquitous and also provide an additional source of fixed N. This review presents the current knowledge of BNF by free-living, non-symbiotic and symbiotic diazotrophs in the global N cycle, examines global and regional estimates of contributions of BNF, and discusses possible strategies to enhance BNF for the prospective benefit of cereal N nutrition. We conclude by considering the challenges of introducing in planta BNF into cereals and reflect on the potential for BNF in both conventional and alternative crop management systems to encourage the ecological intensification of cereal and legume production.",

        "abstract": "Growing public concern over agricultural nitrogen (N) pollution is now reflected in consumers’ food choices and shareholders’ resolutions, causing rapid changes in global food supply chains. Nitrate (NO3) leaching represents the primary N source for groundwater contamination and freshwater ecosystem degradation. However, simplified science-based indicators are still lacking to facilitate improved N management practices at the farm-level. We conducted a global analysis of published field studies to evaluate N balance (N inputs minus N outputs) as a robust predictor for NO3 losses. Using 82 studies (1110 observations) for rainfed cereal crops in temperate regions, we 1) quantified the response of NO3 losses to changes in N balance for major rainfed cereal crops while accounting for environmental and management variables; and 2) assessed the feasibility of improving water quality through lower N balance under different scenarios using the case study of maize (Zea mays L.) data from the US Corn Belt. Observations were grouped in studies from the US and non-US regions. Results show that NO3 losses increased exponentially as N balance increases for both the US and non-US regions, though they were 60% higher in the US at a given N balance. Scenario analysis revealed that reducing the N rate from the agronomic optimum to the lower point within the economic optimum N rate range decreased NO3 losses by 13% without impacting economic returns. The case study for maize showed that improvements in N use efficiency that increase grain yield at a given fertilizer rate can substantially reduce N balance and mitigate NO3 losses. This study provides an evidence-based foundation for food supply chain companies to mitigate global NO3 pollution, specifically by using the generalized relationships presented here to track progress in NO3 leaching mitigation. To further resolve uncertainties and improve region-specific estimates for NO3 losses, we propose a tiered monitoring and assessment framework similar to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) methodology for N2O emissions, widely implemented in science and used for policy.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is an essential but generally limiting nutrient for biological systems. Development of the Haber-Bosch industrial process for ammonia synthesis helped to relieve N limitation of agricultural production, fueling the Green Revolution and reducing hunger. However, the massive use of industrial N fertilizer has doubled the N moving through the global N cycle with dramatic environmental consequences that threaten planetary health. Thus, there is an urgent need to reduce losses of reactive N from agriculture, while ensuring sufficient N inputs for food security. Here we review current knowledge related to N use efficiency (NUE) in agriculture and identify research opportunities in the areas of agronomy, plant breeding, biological N fixation (BNF), soil N cycling, and modeling to achieve responsible, sustainable use of N in agriculture. Amongst these opportunities, improved agricultural practices that synchronize crop N demand with soil N availability are low-hanging fruit. Crop breeding that targets root and shoot physiological processes will likely increase N uptake and utilization of soil N, while breeding for BNF effectiveness in legumes will enhance overall system NUE. Likewise, engineering of novel N-fixing symbioses in non-legumes could reduce the need for chemical fertilizers in agroecosystems but is a much longer-term goal. The use of simulation modeling to conceptualize the complex, interwoven processes that affect agroecosystem NUE, along with multi-objective optimization, will also accelerate NUE gains.",

        "abstract": "In the last six decades, the consumption of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in the form of fertilizer in India has been growing rapidly, whilst the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of cropping systems has been decreasing. These trends have led to increasing environmental losses of Nr, threatening the quality of air, soils, and fresh waters, and thereby endangering climate-stability, ecosystems, and human-health. Since it has been suggested that the fertilizer consumption of India may double by 2050, there is an urgent need for scientific research to support better nitrogen management in Indian agriculture. In order to share knowledge and to develop a joint vision, experts from the UK and India came together for a conference and workshop on “Challenges and Opportunities for Agricultural Nitrogen Science in India.” The meeting concluded with three core messages: (1) Soil stewardship is essential and legumes need to be planted in rotation with cereals to increase nitrogen fixation in areas of limited Nr availability. Synthetic symbioses and plastidic nitrogen fixation are possibly disruptive technologies, but their potential and implications must be considered. (2) Genetic diversity of crops and new technologies need to be shared and exploited to reduce N losses and support productive, sustainable agriculture livelihoods. (3) The use of leaf color sensing shows great potential to reduce nitrogen fertilizer use (by 10–15%). This, together with the usage of urease inhibitors in neem-coated urea, and better management of manure, urine, and crop residues, could result in a 20–25% improvement in NUE of India by 2030.",

        "issued": "2022-08",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human grayanotoxin poisoning is distinctly uncommon in North America, as the predominant source of human exposure is honey made by bees pollinating rhododendron species in the Mediterranean. We present a case of confirmed grayanotoxin poisoning from honey imported from Turkey. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old man developed nausea, lightheadedness, and lost consciousness. Onset was 30 min after the ingestion of honey that was brought to the United States from Turkey. Emergency medical services found him bradycardic, hypotensive, and unresponsive. He was treated with atropine, saline, and oxygen, at which point his heart rate and blood pressure improved, and he regained consciousness. A similar episode several days earlier was followed by a brief unrevealing hospitalization. He was again hospitalized, and had a normal echocardiogram, telemetric monitoring, and complete laboratory studies. Grayanotoxins I and III were subsequently identified in the patient's blood, urine, and honey. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Grayanotoxins are diterpenoids found in rhododendron species, whose clinical effects span multiple organ systems including gastrointestinal, cardiac, and neurologic. Treatment is largely supportive, and a good response to atropine and intravenous fluids has been described. Laboratory confirmation of grayanotoxins is not available in a short enough turnaround time to be clinically useful during immediate management, but confirmatory testing may obviate further unnecessary evaluation. Grayanotoxins are likely to remain a rare source of poisoning in North America, but recurrent bradycardia without alternative etiology should prompt a thorough exposure history, which may reveal, as in this case, a treatable toxicologic etiology.",

Cardiac blackleg has been reported in ruminants as an uncommon presentation of the disease; its pathogenesis is not understood completely. We include here a literature review of cardiac blackleg and a description of 2 cases in 12-15-mo-old feedlot steers in Argentina. Fourteen of 1,190 steers died suddenly over a period of 10 d. Postmortem examinations were performed on 5 of these animals. Grossly, severe, diffuse, fibrinous pericarditis and pleuritis, multifocal necrohemorrhagic myocarditis, diffuse pulmonary congestion, mild splenomegaly, and moderate congestion of meningeal vessels were observed. No significant gross lesions were observed in the skeletal muscles of any animal. Histology was performed on 2 of the steers. The main microscopic features were necrotizing myocarditis with myriad intralesional gram-positive rods with subterminal spores plus fibrinosuppurative pericarditis and pleuritis. C. chauvoei was detected by immunohistochemistry and PCR in the myocardium of both animals. These findings confirm a diagnosis of cardiac blackleg in these 2 steers and presumptively in the other affected animals.",

Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice.",

An online questionnaire was sent twice to all 54 AAVMC members and sent once to a veterinary toxicology list serve. The survey covered areas related to instructor demographics, the depth and extent of toxicology taught, and the respondent's perceptions of their student's ability to perform entrustable professional activities (EPA). Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Our survey resulted in a 44% response rate. All responding schools included toxicology in their curriculum, and it was a required course in 23 programs. Contact hours in stand-alone veterinary toxicology courses ranged from 14 to 45 h. Most respondents indicated that the current time allotted for toxicology was inadequate, despite indicating that most of their students could perform most EPAs autonomously. One exception related to the ability of students to analyze toxicology data. We found small variations in teaching methods and curriculum content. The results of our study can assist veterinary schools in evaluating their curricula to better prepare new graduates for the management of toxicology issues they may face in their veterinary careers.",

Selenium deficiency is common in South America, but WMD is underreported. This research describes clinical, biochemical and pathological findings in two episodes of WMD associated with selenium deficiency in beef and dairy calves in Argentina and Uruguay with concurrent copper deficiency in one of them, which resulted in spontaneous calf mortality. Further studies are necessary to estimate the true incidence and economic impact of clinical and subclinical mineral deficiencies in livestock production systems in the southern cone of South America.",

        "abstract": "Since its discovery in 2001, our understanding of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) has undergone a remarkable transformation. Initially characterized rather narrowly as an adult-onset movement disorder, the definition of FXTAS is broadening; moreover, the disorder is now recognized as only one facet of a much broader clinical pleiotropy among children and adults who carry premutation alleles of the FMR1 gene. Furthermore, the intranuclear inclusions of FXTAS, once thought to be a CNS-specific marker of the disorder, are now known to be widely distributed in multiple non-CNS tissues; this observation fundamentally changes our concept of the disease, and may provide the basis for understanding the diverse medical problems associated with the premutation. Recent work on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying FXTAS indicates that the origins of the late-onset neurodegenerative disorder actually lie in early development, raising the likelihood that all forms of clinical involvement among premutation carriers have a common underlying mechanistic basis. There has also been great progress in our understanding of the triggering event(s) in FXTAS pathogenesis, which is now thought to involve sequestration of one or more nuclear proteins involved with microRNA biogenesis. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that mitochondrial dysregulation contributes to the decreased cell function and loss of viability, evident in mice even during the neonatal period. Taken together, these recent findings offer hope for early interventions for FXTAS, well before the onset of overt disease, and for the treatment of other forms of clinical involvement among premutation carriers.",

        "abstract": "The forces responsible for the formation and stabilization of secondary and higher-order nucleic acid structure can be more fully understood once the sequence-dependent properties (e.g. intrinsic rigidity, effective rise) of the component single-stranded species are well-defined. Knowledge of the conformations of the single-stranded polymers is also important for the development of better polyelectrolyte models for various structural or strand-dissociation reactions. However, there is at present little quantitative information regarding the sequence dependence of either rise or rigidity in single-stranded DNA or RNA polymers. To address this issue, we describe a form of transient electric birefringence (TEB) measurement in which the rotational decay times (taugap) of DNA molecules possessing central, single-stranded regions (gaps) are compared with the corresponding times (taudplx) for duplex control molecules of the same length (in nucleotides per strand) as the continuous strand in the \"gapped duplex\". For magnesium ion concentrations above 1-2 mM, the tau ratios ( identical withtaugap/taudplx) for the gapped duplexes reach plateau values, above which no further change in tau ratio is observed; values for the persistence length (P) and internucleotide spacing (h) of the gap sequences are obtained from the experimental tau ratios. For dTn, the permissible ranges of P and h are 20-30 A and 5-7 A per nucleotide (nt), respectively, with optimal values of 31 A (P) and 5. 2 A/nt (h). For dAn, the persistence length for the low temperature (4 degreesC), stacked form is 78 (+/-8) A for a helix rise of 3.2 A/nt. One significant advantage of the current method over previous approaches is the use of short (80-100 nt) molecules, thus facilitating the production of various gap sequences through synthetic means.",

        "abstract": "Internal loops are structural elements, often highly conserved, that are found in many RNA molecules of biological importance. They consist of short stretches of sequence in which the bases in one strand are not able to form canonical pairs with bases in the other strand, and are bounded on either side by helical RNA. In an effort to examine the influence of internal loops on the relative angular orientations of the flanking helices, we have quantified the apparent bend angles for symmetric internal loops of the form A(n)-A(n) and U(n)-U(n) (n=2, 4, and 6), located at the center of 150 to 154 bp RNA molecules, using the method of transient electric birefringence. This hydrodynamic method exploits the extreme sensitivity of the rate of rotational reorientation of the RNA molecules to the presence and magnitude of internal bends and/or points of increased flexibility. The birefringence decay behavior of the loop-containing RNA molecules was found to be much less strongly influenced by the presence of symmetric internal loops than by bulges of the same sequence and size. This general observation is mirrored by the electrophoretic behavior of the loop-containing molecules, which are much less strongly retarded on polyacrylamide gels than are corresponding, bulge-containing RNA molecules. The apparent bend angles for the symmetric loops range from approximately 20 degrees to 40 degrees as n is increased 2 to 6 with a marginal shift to smaller angles in the presence of Mg2+. The apparent angles were similar when represented either as fixed bends of the specified angles (static representation), or as points of increased flexibility of specified root-mean-square angle (dynamic representation). For the. For the latter representation, the corresponding angular dispersion would correspond to a loop persistence length of approximately 60 to 150 A, compared to 700 A for duplex RNA and depending slightly on sequence and buffer conditions.",

METHODS: National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) database from 2000 to 2018 was queried to report incidence and survival data in 4253 cases in the U.S. RESULTS: Males were 5.37 times more likely and Non-Hispanic-White people (NHW) were 4.62 times more likely than females and Non-Hispanic-Black people (NHB) to develop CSTS of the head and neck. The overall incidence was 0.27 per 100,000 persons in 2018, with a significant increase since 2000. Advanced age and stage, histologic group other than 'fibromatous sarcoma' and lower SES groups were independent factors for worse overall survival.

Outcomes of the Compress® Compliant Pre-Stress (CPS) spindle paired with an Orthopedic Salvage System expandable distal femur endoprosthesis have not been reported. METHODS: We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective study of pediatric patients with distal femoral bone sarcomas reconstructed with the above endoprostheses. Statistical analysis utilized Kaplan-Meier survival technique and competing risk analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included from five institutions. Spindle survivorship was 86.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.7-93.5) at 10 years. Two patients had a failure of osseointegration (5.7%), both within 12 months. Twenty-two (59%) patients had 70 lengthening procedures, with mean expansions of 3.2 cm (range: 1-9) over 3.4 surgeries. The expandable mechanism failed in eight patients with a cumulative incidence of 16.1% (95% CI, 5.6-31.5) at 5 years. Twenty-nine patients sustained International Society of Limb Salvage failures requiring 63 unplanned surgeries. Periprosthetic joint infection occurred in six patients (16.7%). Limb preservation rate was 91% at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of osseointegration of the Compress® spindle among pediatric patients when coupled with an expandable implant. However, there is a high rate of expansion mechanism failure and prosthetic joint infections requiring revision surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 5% of cancer patients in the United States presented with metastatic bone disease (MBD) at diagnosis. Current study explores the disparities in survival for patients with MBD. METHODS: Patients with the diagnosis of MBD at presentation for the five most common primary anatomical sites were extracted from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Census tract-level dataset (2010-2016). Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazard models were used to evaluate survival, and prognostic factors for each cohort. Prognostic significance of socioeconomic status (SES) and insurance status were ascertained. RESULTS: The five most common anatomical-sites with MBD at presentation included \"lung\" (n = 59 739), \"prostate\" (n = 19 732), \"breast\" (n = 16 244), \"renal and urothelium\" (n = 7718) and \"colon\" (n= 3068). Lower SES was an independent risk factor for worse disease-specific survival (DSS) for patients with MBD originating from lung, prostate, breast and colon. Lack of insurance was an independent risk factor for worse DSS for MBD patients with primary tumors in lung and breast. CONCLUSIONS: MBD patients from the five most common primary sites demonstrated SES and insurance-related disparities in disease-specific survival. This is the first and largest study to explore SES and insurance-related disparities among patients specifically afflicted with MBD. Our findings highlight vulnerability of patients with MBD across multiple primary sites to financial toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a rare neoplasm of the joint synovium that has a wide clinical spectrum including pain and stiffness in the affected joint, joint swelling, periarticular erosions, and cartilage loss, which can severely impact quality of life. The mainstay treatment for TGCT has been surgery involving partial or total synovectomy using arthroscopic or open techniques. However, surgical resection alone is associated with high recurrence rates, particularly in diffuse-TGCT (D-TGCT) cases. The 3 cases presented here summarize a combination approach (surgery+pexidartinib [tyrosine kinase inhibitor]) in patients with previously unresectable or inoperable D-TGCT. Case 1-Hip. A 29-year-old male was treated with pexidartinib prior to surgery, resulting in tumor reduction. A left total hip arthroplasty (THA) was then performed with a lack of recurrence in 12 months postoperative, and the patient currently on pexidartinib treatment. Case 2-Foot. A 35-year-old female, nearly a decade following a left foot mass resection, was treated with pexidartinib following disease recurrence. A decrease in soft tissue lesions at the midfoot and decreased marrow enhancement at the first metatarsal head were seen within 4-5 months of pexidartinib treatment; the patient is currently on pexidartinib (400 mg/day) with improved symptom control. Case 3-Knee. A 55-year-old male patient received pexidartinib pre- and postoperatively. A reduction in swelling and the size of the popliteal cyst was significant and maintained, with the synovial disease growing when pexidartinib was discontinued. Surgery and adjuvant therapy eliminated the disease as of the last follow-up visit (11 months postoperative). These cases provide a unique perspective based on tumor location, type/timing of treatment strategy, and patient outcomes. Optimal treatment strategies for this debilitating disease may entail utilizing a combination approach (surgery+systemic treatment) to reduce surgical morbidity and the risk of postoperative disease recurrence.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent and drivers of telehealth use variation across clinicians within the same pediatric subspecialties. METHODS: In this mixed methods study, 8 pediatric medical groups in California shared data for eleven subspecialties. We calculated the proportion of total visits delivered via telehealth by medical group for each subspecialty and identified the 8 most common International Classification of Diseases 10 diagnoses for telehealth and in-person visits in endocrinology and neurology. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 pediatric endocrinologists and neurologists and applied a positive deviance approach comparing high versus low utilizers to identify factors that influenced their level of telehealth use. RESULTS: In 2019, medical groups that submitted quantitative data conducted 1.8 million visits with 549,306 unique pediatric patients. For 3 subspecialties, there was relatively little variation in telehealth use across medical groups: urology (mean: 16.5%, range: 9%-23%), orthopedics (mean: 7.2%, range: 2%-14%), and cardiology (mean: 11.2%, range: 2%-24%). The remaining subspecialties, including neurology (mean: 58.6%, range: 8%-93%) and endocrinology (mean: 49.5%, range: 24%-92%), exhibited higher levels of variation. For both neurology and endocrinology, the top diagnoses treated in-person were similar to those treated via telehealth. There was limited consensus on which clinical conditions were appropriate for telehealth. High telehealth utilizers were more comfortable conducting telehealth visits for new patients and often worked in practices with innovations to support telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians perceive that telehealth may be appropriate for a range of clinical conditions when the right supports are available.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study investigates outcomes from two federal grant programs: the Evidence-Based Tele-Behavioral Health Network Program (EB THNP) funded from September 2018 to August 2021 and the Substance Abuse Treatment Telehealth Network Grant Program (SAT TNGP) funded from September 2017 to August 2020. As part of the health services implementation program, the aims of this study were to evaluate outcomes in patient symptoms of depression and anxiety across the programs' 17 grantees and 95 associated sites, with each grantee having data from telehealth patients and from an in-person comparison group. METHODS: The research design is a prospective multi-site observational study. Each grantee provided data on a nonrandomized convenience sample of telehealth patients and an in-person comparison group from sites with similar rural characteristics and during the same time period. Patient characteristics were collected at treatment initiation, and clinical outcome measures were collected at baseline and monthly. The validated clinical outcome measure instruments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression symptoms and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale for anxiety-related symptoms. Linear mixed models, with grantee as the random effect, were used to determine the association of behavioral health delivery (telehealth versus in-person) on the one-month change in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 while adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Across a total of 1,514 patients, one-month change scores were improved indicating that PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to the one-month follow-up at similar rates in both the in-person and telehealth groups. Reduction in scores averaged 2.8 for the telehealth treatment group and 2.9 for the in-person treatment group in the PHQ-9 subsample and 2.0 for the telehealth treatment group and 2.4 for the in-person treatment group in the GAD-7 subsample. There was no statistically significant association between the modality of care (telehealth treatment group versus in-person comparison group) and the one-month change scores for either PHQ-9 or GAD-7. Individuals with higher baseline scores demonstrated the greatest decrease in scores for both measures. Upon adjusting for baseline scores and grantee program, patient demographics were not found to be significantly associated with change in anxiety or depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: In our very large pragmatic study comparing behavioral health treatment delivered to a population of patients in rural, underserved communities, we found no clinical or statistical differences in improvements in depression or anxiety symptoms as measured by the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 between patients treated via telehealth or in-person.",

        "abstract": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) believes that an appropriately financed graduate medical education (GME) system is critical to ensuring that sufficient numbers of trained pediatricians are available to provide optimal health care to all children. A shortage of pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists currently exists in the United States, and this shortage is likely to intensify because of the growing numbers of children with chronic health problems and special health care needs. It is equally important to maintain the supply of primary care pediatricians. The AAP, therefore, recommends that children's hospital GME positions funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration be increased to address this escalating demand for pediatric health services. The AAP also recommends that GME funding for pediatric physician training provide full financial support for all years of training necessary to meet program requirements. In addition, all other entities that gain from GME training should participate in its funding in a manner that does not influence curriculum, requirements, or outcomes. Furthermore, the AAP supports funding for training innovations that improve the health of children. Finally, the AAP recommends that all institutional recipients of GME funding allocate these funds directly to the settings where training occurs in a transparent manner.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To validate the association between body composition and mortality in men treated with radiation for localized prostate cancer (PCa). Secondarily, to integrate body composition as a factor to classify patients by risk of all-cause mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants of NRG/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9406 and NRG/RTOG 0126 with archived computed tomography were included. Muscle mass and muscle density were estimated by measuring the area and attenuation of the psoas muscles on a single slice at L4-L5. Bone density was estimated by measuring the attenuation of the vertebral body at mid-L5. Survival analyses, including Cox proportional hazards models, assessed the relationship between body composition and mortality. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to create a classification tree to classify participants by risk of death. RESULTS: Data from 2066 men were included in this study. In the final multivariable model, psoas area, comorbidity score, baseline prostate serum antigen, and age were significantly associated with survival. The RPA yielded a classification tree with four prognostic groups determined by age, comorbidity, and psoas area. Notably, the classification among older (≥70 years) men into prognostic groups was determined by psoas area. CONCLUSIONS: This study strongly supports that body composition is related to mortality in men with localized PCa. The inclusion of psoas area in the RPA classification tree suggests that body composition provides additive information to age and comorbidity status for mortality prediction, particularly among older men. More research is needed to determine the clinical impact of body composition on prognostic models in men with PCa.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To study the relationship between percentage coverage of planning target volume (PTV) in prostate cancer IMRT and dose received by normal critical structures Method and Materials: Five patients with early stage prostate cancer were selected for this retrospective planning study. For 4 of 5 patients, PTV contains clinical target volume (CTV), which is the prostate gland, plus 0.8 cm uniform margin. For the fifth patient, PTV is formed by expanding CTV (prostate plus 1 cm proximal seminal vesicle) with 0.8 cm uniform margin. The prescription is 74 Gy for the first four patients and 79.2 Gy (last patient) prescribed to 95% iso dose line and dose normalization is to isocenter. For each patient, seven different plans were generated using Varian Eclipse treatment planning system version 8.1 for 18 MV photon beams from Varian 2100C: one 6‐field conformal plan and six 7‐field IMRT plans with PTV volume coverage raging from 99.5% to 95%. IMRT plans were optimized by iterations to reach the targeted coverage of PTV. Results: A linear correlation between the volume receiving 70 Gy in percentage or cc and PTV volume coverage from 99.5% to 95% has been found for both balder and rectum with R2 better than 0.95 for bladder and 0.91 for rectum for the first four patients. A generalized relationship can be written as [formula omitted] (1). All patients have a similar linear slope for bladder (average slope is 0.867±0.083 (SD)) and a slightly different slope for rectum (average slope is 0.545±0.230 (SD)). In equation (1), interception b is dependant of structure volume (bladder and rectum). Conclusions: Volume received 70 Gy by bladder and rectum in IMRT plans for prostate as CTV may have a linear relationship with PTV coverage ranging from 99.5% to 95%. One may use this relationship to guide in treatment planning process. © 2009, American Association of Physicists in Medicine. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To analyze difference of guidance for daily setup verification between kilovoltage (kV) Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and electromagnetic tracking system (Calypso) for prostate cancer patients receiving Intensity‐Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). Methods: Sixteen prostate patients' data sets were analyzed. The daily treatment table shifts given by CBCT and Calypso systems to bring the patient's Planning Target Volume (PTV) to isocenter were noted. Calypso transponders were used as fiducial markers and patients shifted based on CBCT findings. Calypso system was then utilized to show the setup (residual) error. 577 CBCT images and Calypso data pairs were analyzed, with three shifts recorded for each. The number of times in which the shift difference (in absolute terms) between CBCT and Calypso agreed within 3 mm was recorded. Then the vector length of the residual errors determined by Calypso was calculated and compared to the 3D Clinical Target Volume (CTV)‐PTV margin (8 mm). Results: There were 424 cases (73.5 %) where the shift differences between CBCT and Calypso agreed within 3 mm in all three orthogonal directions. After the patient was shifted to isocenter by the CBCT data, there were 526 cases (91.2 %) where the vector length of the residual errors determined by Calypso was less than 8 mm and thus within the PTV margin; a frequency distribution for residuals gave a median vector of 4.3 mm. Conclusions: The CBCT and Calypso systems are complimentary for daily setup verification in IMRT prostate patients. Residual error due to intrafraction motion was less than 5 mm after CBCT alignment. Hence, margin reduction appears feasible allowing for further dose escalation. In addition, shape deformation data provided by CBCT for prostate and Organs at Risk (OARs) essential for facilitating real‐time geometric treatment adjustments. © 2011, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

OBJECTIVES: Describe clinicopathologic and ultrasonographic features of dogs with GDH and those suspected of having GDH that had the disease ruled out. ANIMALS: Six hundred twenty-three dogs. METHODS: Records from dogs with suspected GDH between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed. Dogs with hyperkalemia or hyponatremia were excluded. Dogs were categorized as controls when the resting serum cortisol or post-ACTH cortisol concentration were > 2 μg/dL. Clinicopathologic and ultrasonographic features were compared between groups. The optimal cut-point, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for individual features used to detect GDH. RESULTS: Dogs were categorized as GDH (n = 29) or controls (n = 594). Lymphocyte count (>1750 cells/L; sensitivity, 96.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 82.8%-99.8%; specificity, 60.3%; 95% CI, 56.3%-64.1%; AUC, 0.828; 95% CI, 0.762-0.894) and albumin/globulin ratio (<1.081; sensitivity, 86.2%; 95% CI, 69.4%-94.5%; specificity, 78.8%; 95% CI, 75.3%-81.9%; AUC, 0.886; 95% CI, 0.827-0.944) had the highest discriminatory power between groups. Left adrenal gland width <0.39 cm was 80% (95% CI, 58.4%-91.9%) sensitive and 82.4% (95% CI, 74.2-88.4) specific for GDH. Serum cobalamin concentrations and ultrasonographic abnormalities of the GI tract were not different between groups. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: No single variable could be used to confidently rule out GDH and obviate the need for cortisol testing in dogs with a clinical presentation consistent with GDH.",

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate serum folate concentrations in dogs with and without CE and associations with sample hemolysis and selected markers of CE. We hypothesized that hypofolatemia would be more common in dogs with CE and associated with hypocobalaminemia, higher CIBDAI, and hypoalbuminemia. ANIMALS: Six hundred seventy-three dogs with available serum folate measurements performed at an academic veterinary hospital between January 2016 and December 2019. METHODS: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to categorize cases as CE or non-CE and record clinical details and laboratory markers. Relationships between serum folate, cobalamin, and CE variables were assessed using chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, or Spearman's correlation tests. RESULTS: Of the 673 dogs, 99 CE were compared to 95 non-CE. In the overall cohort, serum folate concentration did not correlate with sample hemolysis (P = .75). In the CE subset, serum folate and cobalamin concentrations were positively associated (rho = 0.34, FDR = 0.02). However, serum folate concentrations (median [25th, 75th percentiles]) were higher (CE: 12.1 (8.9, 16.1), non-CE: 10.4 (7.2, 15.5); P = .04) and cobalamin concentrations were lower (CE: 343 (240, 597), non-CE: 550 (329, 749); P = .001) in the CE vs non-CE group. Serum folate was not associated with markers of CE, but serum cobalamin was associated with albumin (P = .04) and cholesterol (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Hypofolatemia is an inferior biomarker of CE compared to hypocobalaminemia.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the prescription patterns and appropriateness of the use of gastroprotectant medication in cats. METHODS: Pharmacy dispensation logs from an academic tertiary referral center were reviewed between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018. Cats that were administered proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), sucralfate, misoprostol, antacids or a combination were included. Data regarding medication, dosage, formulation, duration of administration, completeness of discharge instructions and clinical rationales for administration were obtained from medical records. The appropriateness of gastroprotectant use was assessed according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus statement guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 110 cases, 67 (60.9%) were prescribed a gastroprotectant medication without an appropriate indication. The most common reason for prescription was acute kidney injury in 26/67 (38.8%). PPIs were the most common gastroprotectant medication administered in 95/110 (86.3%) cats, followed by sucralfate in 18/110 (16.4%) and H2RAs in 11/110 (10%). Of the 35 cases in which gastroprotectant therapy was indicated, the medication chosen or dosage administered was considered suboptimal in 16 (45.7%). Instructions regarding the duration of administration, potential adverse effects and timing of administration in relation to meals or other medications were inconsistently provided in discharge instructions to pet owners. Of the 29 cases discharged with omeprazole, only 13 (44.8%) instructions included a duration of administration, while 6 (20.7%) recommended continuing gastroprotectants indefinitely until further notice, 16 (55.2%) discussed the timing of the administration in relation to a meal and six (20.7%) mentioned potential adverse effects; none advised tapering of omeprazole before discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: When prescribed, gastroprotectant medications were frequently prescribed injudiciously to cats in this referral population over a 12-month period. Discharge instructions to pet owners also often lacked information and recommendations regarding optimal administration, potential adverse effects, and tapering or discontinuation of the medications.",

        "abstract": "Many mammals rely on volatile organic chemical compounds (VOCs) produced by bacteria for their communication and behavior, though little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms or bacterial species that are responsible. We used metagenomic sequencing, mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, and culturing to profile the microbial and volatile chemical constituents of anal gland secretions in twenty-three domestic cats (Felis catus), in attempts to identify organisms potentially involved in host odor production. We found that the anal gland microbiome was dominated by bacteria in the genera Corynebacterium, Bacteroides, Proteus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus, and showed striking variation among individual cats. Microbiome profiles also varied with host age and obesity. Metabolites such as fatty-acids, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols were detected in glandular secretions. Overall, microbiome and metabolome profiles were modestly correlated (r = 0.17), indicating that a relationship exists between the bacteria in the gland and the metabolites produced in the gland. Functional analyses revealed the presence of genes predicted to code for enzymes involved in VOC metabolism such as dehydrogenases, reductases, and decarboxylases. From metagenomic data, we generated 85 high-quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Of importance were four MAGs classified as Corynebacterium frankenforstense, Proteus mirabilis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Bacteroides fragilis. They represent strong candidates for further investigation of the mechanisms of volatile synthesis and scent production in the mammalian anal gland.",

        "abstract": "The almond [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb] is normally self-sterile, requiring orchard placement of pollinizer cultivars and insect pollinators. Honeybees are the primary insect pollinators utilized, but climate change and the higher frequency of extreme weather events have reduced their availability to levels insufficient to meet the demands of current and anticipated almond acreage. The incorporation of self-fruitfulness may eliminate the need for both pollinizers and pollinators and allow the planting of single cultivar orchards that facilitate orchard management and reduce agrochemical inputs. Self-fruitfulness requires self-compatibility of self-pollen tube growth to fertilization, as well as a high level of consistent self-pollination or autogamy over the range of anticipated bloom environments. The Italian cultivar Tuono has been the sole source of self-compatibility for breeding programs world-wide, leading to high levels of inbreeding in current almond improvement programs. Both self-compatibility and autogamy have been successfully transferred to commercial almonds from cultivated peaches (Prunus persica L.), as well as wild peach and almond species. Self-compatibility was inherited as a novel major gene, but was also influenced by modifiers. Molecular markers developed for one species source often failed to function for other species’ sources. Autogamy was inherited as a quantitative trait. Breeding barriers were more severe in the early stages of trait introgression, but rapidly diminished by the second to third backcross. Increasing kernel size, which was similarly inherited as a quantitative trait, was a major regulator of the introgression rate. Self-fruitfulness, along with good commercial performance of tree and nut traits, was recovered from different species sources, including Prunus mira, Prunus webbii, P. persica, and the P. webbii-derived Italian cultivar Tuono. Differences in expression of self-fruitfulness were observed, particularly during field selection at the early growth stages. Introgression of self-fruitfulness from these diverse sources also enriched overall breeding germplasm, allowing the introduction of useful traits that are not accessible within traditional germplasm.",

Without immediate short- and long-term actions, prime Prunus orchard land will be permanently out of production, resulting in a devastating effect on the industries and local communities. Causal pathogenic fungi consist of three geographically isolated species: Armillaria mellea in California, A. solidipes in Michigan, and Desarmillaria tabescens in the southeastern US. The most economical and sustainable approach to prevent the loss of peach, cherry, and almond production due to Armillaria infection is to develop ARR-resistant, horticulturally acceptable rootstocks. A trans-disciplinary, multi-crop, multi-institutional team of researchers, growers and nursery representatives are dedicated to finding short- and long-term solutions for the ARR replant issue affecting the US stone fruit industry. This project will provide the ‘building blocks’ needed to enable and accelerate on-going Prunus breeding programs, as well as support the testing of cultural practices for short-term solutions to increase tree longevity on replant sites.",

        "abstract": "Almond shell hardness is an economically important quality trait that protects the integrity of the kernel. It is directly related with shelling or crack-out percent. In the U.S. and Australian markets, soft to semi-hard shells varieties have been used in the industry, while in the European market, hard shells are dominantly sold and distributed. The origin of a hard shell is from wild almond species. Soft shells in the USA and Australia have been selected for a higher crack-out percent or larger kernel and ease of processing. Here, we examined breeding populations totaling 264 trees that were genotyped with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) where shell hardness was measured with a texture analyzer, and shell weight, in-shell weights and shell thickness were measured and crack-out percent was calculated. In a genome-wide association, seven genetic loci were found to be associated with shell hardness, crack-out percent, shell thickness and shell weight. Of these seven, one was shared between multiple traits. Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays were developed and tested in unrelated breeding lines from Australia, Spain, France and Italy. One KASP assay was found to be highly predictive of shell hardness in this diverse panel and can be applied for use in marker-assisted breeding.",

        "abstract": "While genomes were originally seen as static entities that stably held and organized genetic information, recent advances in sequencing have uncovered the dynamic nature of the genome. New conceptualizations of the genome include complex relationships between the environment and gene expression that must be maintained, regulated, and sometimes even transmitted over generations. The discovery of epigenetic mechanisms has allowed researchers to understand how traits like phenology, plasticity, and fitness can be altered without changing the underlying deoxyribonucleic acid sequence. While many discoveries were first made in animal systems, plants provide a particularly complex set of epigenetic mechanisms due to unique aspects of their biology and interactions with human selective breeding and cultivation. In the plant kingdom, annual plants have received the most attention; however, perennial plants endure and respond to their environment and human management in distinct ways. Perennials include crops such as almond, for which epigenetic effects have long been linked to phenomena and even considered relevant for breeding. Recent discoveries have elucidated epigenetic phenomena that influence traits such as dormancy and self-compatibility, as well as disorders like noninfectious bud failure, which are known to be triggered by the environment and influenced by inherent aspects of the plant. Thus, epigenetics represents fertile ground to further understand almond biology and production and optimize its breeding. Here, we provide our current understanding of epigenetic regulation in plants and use almond as an example of how advances in epigenetics research can be used to understand biological fitness and agricultural performance in crop plants.",

        "abstract": "The focus of this study is to profile changes in DNA methylation and small RNA expression occurring with increased age in almond breeding germplasm to identify possible biomarkers of age that can be used to assess the potential of individuals to develop aging-related disorders. To profile DNA methylation in almond germplasm, 70 methylomes were generated from almond individuals representing three age cohorts (11, 7, and 2 years old) using an enzymatic methyl-seq approach followed by analysis to call differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within these cohorts. Small RNA (sRNA) expression was profiled in three breeding selections, each from two age cohorts (1 and 6 years old), using sRNA-Seq followed by differential expression analysis. Weighted chromosome-level methylation analysis reveals hypermethylation in 11-year-old almond breeding selections when compared to 2-year-old selections in the CG and CHH contexts. Seventeen consensus DMRs were identified in all age contrasts. sRNA expression differed significantly between the two age cohorts tested, with significantly decreased expression in sRNAs in the 6-year-old selections compared to the 1-year-old. Almond shows a pattern of hypermethylation and decreased sRNA expression with increased age. Identified DMRs and differentially expressed sRNAs could function as putative biomarkers of age following validation in additional age groups.",

        "abstract": "Using finite-temperature strong-coupling expansions for the SU(N) Hubbard model, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the model in the infinite-U limit for arbitrary density 0≤ρ≤1 and all N. We express the ferromagnetic susceptibility of the model as a Curie term plus Δχ, an excess susceptibility above the Curie behavior. We show that, on a bipartite lattice, graph by graph the contributions to Δχ are non-negative in the limit that the hole density δ=1-ρ goes to zero. By summing the contributions from all graphs consisting of closed loops we find that the low-hole-density ferromagnetic susceptibility diverges exponentially as expΔ/T as T→0 in two and higher dimensions. This demonstrates that the Nagaoka-Thouless ferromagnetic state exists as a thermodynamic state of matter at low enough density of holes and sufficiently low temperatures. The constant Δ scales with the SU(N) parameter N as 1/N implying that ferromagnetism is gradually weakened with increasing N as the characteristic temperature scale for ferromagnetic order goes down.",

        "abstract": "We study the ground state and thermodynamic properties of the spin-half XXZ model, with an Ising interaction Jz and a transverse exchange interaction Jx, on a pyrochlore tube obtained by joining together elementary cubes in a one-dimensional array. Periodic boundary conditions in the transverse directions ensure that the bulk of the system consists of corner-sharing tetrahedra, with the same local geometry as the pyrochlore lattice. We use exact diagonalization, the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) methods to study the system. When Jz is antiferromagnetic (Jz>0) and Jx is ferromagnetic (Jx<0), we find a transition from a spin liquid to an XY ferromagnet, which has power-law correlations at T=0. For Jz<0 and Jx>0, spin-two excitations are found to have lower energy than spin-one at the transition away from the fully polarized state, showing evidence for incipient spin-nematic order. When both interactions are antiferromagnetic, we find a nondegenerate ground state with no broken symmetries and a robust energy gap. The low-energy spectra evolve smoothly from predominantly Ising to predominantly XY interactions. In the spin-liquid regime of small |Jx|, we study the confinement of monopole-antimonopole pairs and find that the confinement length scale is larger for Jx<0 than for Jx>0, although both length scales are very short. These results are consistent with a local spin-liquid phase for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with no broken symmetries.",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>There is strong evidence in humans and in animal models that the gut microbiome is altered in obesity and/or the insulin resistant condition. Poor metabolic health is often linked to overnutrition and poor‐quality diets, and the gut microbiome is highly dependent on these factors. Less well appreciated is the potential role of host metabolic physiology in modifying gut microbial ecology. To address this question, we have used the UCD‐T2DM Rat model to test whether the gut microbiome is altered during the progression of diabetes when controlling for exogenous factors (sex, strain, age, diet and vivarium housing). Cecal microbial profiles were assessed using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA collected from age‐matched lean Sprague‐Dawley rats (LSD, n = 12), pre‐diabetic UCD‐T2DM rats (PD, n = 15), recently‐diabetic UCD‐T2DM rats (RD, n = 10), and 3‐months (D3M n = 11) and 6‐months (D6M n = 7) post‐diabetic UCD‐T2DM rats. LSD rats had significantly greater sample diversity (Shannon Index) at phylum level (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05, ANOVA), but significantly lower sample richness (Chao1) at genus level (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) when compared to all UCD‐T2DM rat groups. β‐diversity was significantly different by group (P &lt; 0.05; PERMANVOA), with LSD rats distinctly clustered from all UCD‐T2DM rat groups in non‐metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) plots. A total of 30 genera were significantly altered between LSD and UCD‐T2DM rat groups, with <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic> being the highest abundance genera that was greater in all UCD‐T2DM rat groups relative to LSD (1.7%, 7.6, 5.7%, 8.5%, and 13.0% in LSD, PD, RD, D3M, and D6M respectively). When only assessing UCD‐T2DM rat groups, there was a significant main effect of diabetes status, starting at bacterial class level and continuing through genus (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05; PERMANOVA). Only 4 genera were altered between PD and RD groups, while only 3 genera differed between D3M and D6M. NMDS showed that rats from early stages of diabetes (PD plus RD) were discriminated from those in later stages of diabetes (D3M plus D6M). A total of 22 genera were significantly altered when comparing early diabetic groups between later stages. Genus altered with &gt; 1% median relative abundance included <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic> (PD: 1.3%, D6M: 0.9%), <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic> (RD: 5.7%, D6M 13.0%), and an unassigned genera in the <jats:italic>Clostridiaceae</jats:italic> family (PD: 1.1%, D3M: 1.1%). In summary, the cecal gut microbiome in LSD rats was considerably different to UCD‐T2DM rats and may be due to alternative strain backgrounds. A major and novel finding was that significant gut microbe shifts were observed when comparing groups from pre‐ and early‐diabetes stages relative to those in later stages of diabetes, despite controlling for variables that typically confound microbiome studies of type 2 diabetes in humans. This indicates that the metabolic health of the host influences the micro‐ecology of the large intestine.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>This study was supported by USDA‐ARS Project 6026‐51000‐010‐05S.</jats:p>",

        "abstract": "Traditional data-driven soft sensor methods can be regarded as an optimization process to minimize the predicted error. When applying the mean squared error as the objective function, the model tends to be trained to minimize the global errors of overall data samples. However, there are deviations in data from practical operation, in which the model performance in the estimation of the local variations in the target parameter worsens. This work presents a solution to this challenge by considering higher-order moments of prediction residuals, which enables the evaluation of deviations of the residual distribution from the normal distribution. By embedding constraints on the distribution of residuals into the objective function, the model tends to converge to the state where both stationary and deviation data can be accurately predicted. Data from the Tennessee Eastman process and an industrial cracking furnace are considered to validate the performance of the proposed modeling method.",

        "abstract": "Although deep autoencoders excel at extracting intricate features, their application in process monitoring is limited by the requirement for large sample sizes and interpretability of latent representations. This work presents a special deep learning structure named Siamese network to detect abnormal deviations in nonlinear dynamic processes. By leveraging the capability of Siamese architecture to process multiple inputs simultaneously, the training sample size expands exponentially, which enhances the learning potential of the model. Furthermore, a long short-term memory unit is integrated to enable the capture of long-term process dynamics. To refine the distribution of latent features extracted from diverse data types, a contrastive loss function is proposed, which strengthens the model's fault detection capabilities and enhances its interpretation of latent representations. Then T2 statistic is established on the latent space to perform fault detection. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies on simulation processes and an industrial process.",

        "abstract": "A computer controlled dip-coating apparatus was constructed to investigate physical aspects of transient coating processes and the feasibility of minimizing fluid retention during such operations. Electrobalance measurement of mass retention and drainage has elucidated a number of features which have not received prior notice. Relaxation processes were observed when the substrate motion was halted: the long-time behavior agreed with a combination of Landau-Levich and Jeffreys theories. However, short-time meniscus relaxation produced significant departures which are not fully understood. Comparisons of fluid retention were made for variable draw lengths: good agreement between Landau-Levich theory and experiment was observed even for very short withdrawal lengths, indicating the rapid transition to the steady-state regime. Computer-controlled substrate motion was performed to acquire preliminary information of its effect on mass retention. We investigated constant acceleration and constant speed withdrawal segments over a fixed process time. Experiments involving constant speed withdrawal periods interrupted by drainage periods revealed that more interruptions produced less fluid retention overall; in the limit of an infinite number of interruptions, the retention reached a minimum - equivalent to withdrawing the plate at the time-averaged speed. In addition, ramped speed experiments indicated very little difference over the accessible motion range. As a whole, the study revealed no procedures which could reduce mass retention below that which would be obtained with the slowest allowable constant speed withdrawal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here, we show that the averaged nighttime SOA, especially the fresh local SOA, extreme mass concentrations resulted from anthropogenic volatile organic compounds reductions, while there is a little trend for the regional aged SOA. Meanwhile, these fresh SOA extremes occurred most often under conditions of high relative humidity during nighttime. The analysis presented here provides a comprehensive evaluation of the evolution of the increasingly important organic component of the submicron ambient aerosols in this major metropolitan area.",

Here we show these non-linear O3-PM2.5 relationships including a positive linear part reflecting the O3/PM2.5 co-occurrence and a negative power function part reflecting the O3 formation suppression by PM2.5 based on the multiyear surface observations. The control policies targeting sulfur dioxide and PM2.5, then volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, changed the PM2.5 chemical composition which resulted in an increased linear slope that indicates a weaker O3 control effect than occurred for PM2.5. These policies also enhanced the relative PM2.5 suppression effect as shown by an increase in the power function coefficient. Model simulations suggest that regional equal percentage emission reductions for Beijing and other Chinese megacities will be necessary to avoid further increase in the O3/PM2.5 linear slope and continuing occurrences of high levels of ozone.",

Fog visibility and droplet spectra are observed for four fog cases in the North China Plain from November to December in 2009. The calculated visibility using droplet spectra is similar to the observed visibility for the dense fogs, but is higher than the observed visibility during the relatively light fogs. Two parameterization schemes of fog visibility from previous studies are applied to the four fog cases. The parameterization considering only liquid water content (LWC) has an overestimation of about 70%, while the parameterization using both LWC and Nd has relative errors within 40%, compared to the calculated visibility. However, much larger relative errors are found between the parameterized and the observed visibilities, especially in the relatively light fogs. By slightly changing the coefficients in the parameterization schemes, we found that the scheme considering only LWC fits the calculated visibility with relative errors within 20%, and that the scheme considering both LWC and Nd with relative errors within 5%. Much larger changes of the coefficients are needed in order to best-fit the observed visibility, but still with relative errors larger than 20%. Detailed analyses of the inconsistencies between the calculated, observed and parameterized visibility suggest that the effect of aerosol extinction should be considered in the visibility parameterizations of fogs in the North China plain and other polluted areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Aerosol size distribution and cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) number concentration were measured in the North China Plain from 31 December 2009 to 20 January 2010. The CCN closure study was performed using these data and droplet kinetic condensational growth model. The calculated CCN concentration with the assumption of pure ammonium sulfate aerosol is 40-140% higher than that observed for the supersaturations in this study. A sensitivity test on aerosol solubility and mixing state indicates that 0.2-0.5 mass fraction of ammonium sulfate for internal mixture can lead to a ratio of 0.82-1.30 for the calculated to observed CCN concentrations, and that 0.4-0.7 mass fraction of ammonium sulfate for external mixture results in a ratio of 0.74-1.25 in the North China Plain during the time period of the field observations, suggesting that a relatively simple scheme may be used for CCN prediction in climate models for this region. Finally, we compare the calculated CCN concentrations from the kinetic condensational growth model and the equilibrium model. The kinetic condensational growth model can simulate droplet growth in a time period under a certain supersaturation, while the equilibrium model only predicts whether a certain aerosol can be activated as CCN under that supersaturation. The CCN concentration calculated with the kinetic model is higher than that with the equilibrium model at supersaturations of 0.056% and 0.083%, because some particles that are not activated from the equilibrium point-of-view can grow large enough to be considered as CCN in the kinetic model. While at a supersaturation of 0.17%, CCN concentration calculated with the kinetic model is lower than that with the equilibrium model, due to the limitation of droplet kinetic growth. The calculated CCN concentrations using the kinetic model and the equilibrium model are the same at supersaturations of 0.35% and 0.70%. © 2012 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Highly time resolved measurements of nitrate in ambient aerosols were conducted by an Aerodyne Quadrupole Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (Q-AMS or simply AMS) and a particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS) coupled to ion chromatography from field intensives at two sites: an urban site in New York City (Queens College; QC) for wintertime (22 January to 5 February 2004) and a rural site in southwestern New York state (Pinnacle State Park; PSP) for summertime (18 July to 6 August 2004). In this study, we report that in rural atmospheres the inorganic nitrate signal from Q-AMS may contain significant interferences from organic signals. Analysis of the QC data indicates a good agreement between the PILS-nitrate and AMS-nitrate measurements (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94; linear regression slope = 1.05). In addition, the m/z 30 and m/z 46 (two dominant ion fragments in nitrate mass spectrum) signals tightly correlate at QC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98) and have an average ratio similar to that determined in the laboratory for NH<inf>4</inf>NO<inf>3</inf> (m/z 30/m/z 46 = 2.4). In contrast, at the PSP site the correlation between PILS- and AMS-nitrate was poor (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.34), the AMS reported nitrate values were substantially higher, and the m/z 30 to m/z 46 ratios were generally much larger than 2.4. These observations, together with evaluations by aerosol phase ion balance, indicate that the AMS m/z 30 signals at PSP have been strongly influenced by organic compounds that also produce signals at m/z 30, e.g., organic nitrates (NO<sup>+</sup>), oxygenated organics (CH<inf>2</inf>O<sup>+</sup>), hydrocarbon-like organics (C<inf>2</inf>H<inf>6</inf><sup>+</sup>), and nitrogen-containing organic compounds (CH<inf>4</inf>N<sup>+</sup>).

        "abstract": "Efforts to mitigate the increasing emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will benefit from a One Health perspective, as over half of animal antimicrobials are also considered medically important in humans, and AMR can be maintained in the environment. This is especially pertinent to low- and middle-income countries and in community settings, where an estimated 80% of all antibiotics are used. This study features AMR genes found among humans, animals, and water at an urban informal settlement in Nepal with intensifying livestock production. We sampled humans, chickens, ducks, swine, and water clustered by household, as well as rodents and shrews near dwellings, concurrently in time in July 2017 in southeastern Kathmandu along the Manohara river. Real-time qualitative PCR was performed to screen for 88 genes. Our results characterize the animal-human-environmental interfaces related to the occurrence of specific resistance genes (blaSHV-1 (SHV(238G240E) strain), QnrS, ermC, tetA, tetB, aacC2, aadA1) associated with antibiotics of global health importance that comprise several drug classes, including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, tetracyclines, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. By characterizing risk factors across AMR genes of public health importance, this research highlights potential transmission pathways for further investigation and provides prioritization of community-based prevention and intervention efforts for disrupting AMR transmission of critically important antibiotics used in both humans and animals in Nepal.",

        "abstract": "The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup \"weaning\" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa.",

        "abstract": "Hydatid disease is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by cysts of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. Canids, especially domestic dogs, are definitive hosts of the parasite and are the most pragmatic targets for control programs. A governmental dog deworming campaign was established in 1979 to control hydatidosis in southern Chile, which succeeded in reducing the prevalence of canine echinococcosis in Tierra del Fuego province from 68.4% (in 1978) to 1.2% (in 2002). In 2004, however, the program was dismantled to reduce costs, and since then, no follow-up echinococcosis monitoring has been conducted. We surveyed 356 domestic dogs and interviewed owners or workers at 45 ranches in Chilean Tierra del Fuego during the summer of 2015-2016. Faecal flotation was employed to detect Taeniidae eggs, and PCR was used to test faecal samples for Echinococcus granulosus. Taeniidae eggs and Echinococcus sp. DNA were detected in the faeces of 45.4% (147/324) and 6.9% (23/331) of dogs, respectively. Infrequent dog deworming and the presence of culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus) were significant predictors of the prevalence of Echinococcus sp. DNA and Taeniidae eggs. Furthermore, the presence of introduced chilla foxes (Lycalopex griseus), the municipality, and several operational characteristics of ranches (number of sheep, frequency of sheep slaughter, number of dogs, frequency of removal of dog faeces, feeding of dogs with sheep viscera) were also predictive of the prevalence of Taeniidae eggs. Our findings reveal an ongoing risk of echinococcosis with pathogen maintenance in ranch dogs in Chilean Tierra del Fuego, and in the absence of adequate control programmes, there is a tangible risk of re-emergence of hydatid disease as a public health concern.",

        "abstract": "One Health is a transdisciplinary approach used to address complex concerns related to human, animal, plant, and ecosystem health. One Health frameworks and operational tools are available to support countries and communities, particularly for the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance and the protection of food safety. However, One Health has yet to be implemented in a manner that fully considers the complexities and interconnectedness of the diverse influences that have impacts at a larger system level. This lack of consideration can undermine the sustainability of any positive outcomes. To ensure the One Health approach can function effectively within the new global context of converging and escalating health, social, economic, and ecological crises, it must evolve and expand in three overlapping dimensions: (1) Scope: the partners, knowledge, and knowledge systems included, (2) Approach: the techniques, methodologies, and scholarship considered, and (3) Worldview inclusivity: the interweaving of other worldviews together with the mainstream scientific worldview that currently predominates. Diverse partners and knowledge from outside the mainstream health and scientific sectors, including Indigenous peoples and representatives of local communities, and traditionally generated knowledge, must be included. These systems of knowledge can then be braided together with mainstream science to comprise a holistic framework for decision-making. Scholarship and methodologies being applied in other fields and contexts to solve complex challenges and manage uncertainty, such as collaborative governance, social-ecologic systems theory, and complexity science, must be recognized and incorporated. The spectrum of considered worldviews must also expand to authentically integrate the expanded scope and approach into action and sustainable impact. By increasing community and social engagement and by recognizing and entwining different worldviews, the plurality of disciplines, and traditional and scientific ways of knowing to address community concerns in the contexts in which they exist, we can ensure that One Health remains effective and true to its paradigm in our rapidly changing and complex world.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tendo Achilles lengthening (TAL) for the management of equinus contractures in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) is generally not recommended due to concerns of over-lengthening, resulting in weakness and plantar flexor insufficiency. However, in some cases, surgical correction of severe equinus deformities can only be achieved by TAL. The goal of this study is to assess the outcomes following TAL in these cases. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of children with CP with severe equinus contractures (ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended of -20 degrees or worse) who underwent TAL as part of a single event multilevel surgery, with preoperative and postoperative gait analysis studies. Continuous data were analyzed by paired t test, and categorical data by McNemar Test. RESULTS: There were 60 subjects: 42 unilateral, 18 bilateral CP; 41 GMFCS II, 17 GMFCS I; mean age at surgery was 10.6 years, mean follow-up was 1.3 years. Ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended improved from -28 to 5 degrees (P<0.001). The ankle Gait Variable Score improved from 34.4 to 8.6 (P<0.001). The ankle moment in terminal stance improved from 0.43 to 0.97 Nm/kg (P<0.001). Significant improvements (P<0.001) were seen in radiographic measures of foot alignment following surgery. There were few significant differences in the outcome parameters between subjects with unilateral versus bilateral CP (eg, only the bilateral group showed improved but persistent increased knee flexion in mid-stance). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes following TAL for the management of severe equinus deformity in ambulatory children with CP were favorable 1 year after surgery, with significant improvements in all domains measured. SIGNIFICANCE: This study does not advocate for the widespread use of TAL to correct equinus deformity in children with CP. However, it does show that good short-term outcomes following TAL are possible in properly selected subjects with severe contractures when the dosing of the surgery is optimal (correction of contracture to between 0 and 5 degrees of dorsiflexion with the knee extended) and the procedure is performed in the setting of single event multilevel surgery with subsequent proper orthotic management and rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to establish consensus for the assessment of foot alignment and function in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy, using expert surgeon's opinion through a modified Delphi technique. METHODS: The panel used a five-level Likert-type scale to record agreement or disagreement with 33 statements regarding the assessment of foot alignment and function. Consensus was defined as at least 80% of responses being in the highest or lowest of two of the five Likert-type ratings. General agreement was defined as 60%-79% falling into the highest or lowest two ratings. There was no agreement if neither threshold was reached. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved for 25 (76%) statements, general agreement for 4 (12%) statements, and lack of consensus for 4 (12%) of the statements. There was consensus that the functional anatomy of the foot is best understood by dividing the foot into three segments and two columns. Consensus was achieved concerning descriptors of foot segmental alignment for both static and dynamic assessment. There was consensus that radiographs of the foot should be weight-bearing. There was general agreement that foot deformity in children with cerebral palsy can be classified into three levels based on soft tissue imbalance and skeletal malalignment. CONCLUSION: The practices identified in this study can be used to establish best care guidelines, and the format used will be a template for future Delphi technique studies on clinical decision-making for the management of specific foot segmental malalignment patterns commonly seen in children with cerebral palsy.

        "abstract": "AIM: To assess the accuracy, reliability, and discriminatory ability of a mobile app for measurement of migration percentage in hip surveillance radiographs of children with cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD: The free mobile app HipScreen (www.hipscreen.org) was utilized by a diverse group of users to measure the migration percentage of 40 hips at two time points after completing an online tutorial and competency test. The mean absolute error (MAE) was calculated against the reference standard obtained on a radiology workstation. Statistical analyses included linear regression, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Thirty-seven users completed the study, with 30 having a healthcare professional background, but only 15 with x-ray interpretation expertise. The overall MAE of migration percentage measurement using the HipScreen app was 5.72% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.38-6.06), with good reliability between time points (ICC = 0.83). With a migration percentage less than 30% considered as a positive case, the HipScreen app had a sensitivity of 94% (95% CI: 87-97), specificity of 66% (95% CI: 61-77), and an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). INTERPRETATION: Users from a broad range of backgrounds can utilize the HipScreen app to measure hip surveillance radiographs with clinically acceptable accuracy, reliability, and discriminatory ability. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The HipScreen app can accurately and reliably measure migration percentage. As a screening tool, HipScreen has excellent sensitivity and discriminatory ability. A broad range of HipScreen users achieve clinically acceptable performance.",

        "abstract": "The etiology of congenital muscular torticollis remains a mystery despite intensive investigation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 10 infants with this condition showed signals in the sternocleidomastoid muscle similar to those observed in the forearm and leg after compartment syndrome. Cadaver dissections and injection studies defined the sternocleidomastoid muscle compartment. Injection studies and pressure measurements performed at the time of bipolar release in three patients with congenital muscular torticollis confirmed the existence of this compartment in vivo. Clinical review of 48 children with congenital muscular torticollis showed a relation between birth position and the side affected by the contracture. Because of the association of congenital muscular torticollis with other intrauterine positioning disorders, we postulate that head positioning in utero can selectively injure the sternocleidomastoid muscle, leading to development of a compartment syndrome. Congenital muscular torticollis may represent the sequela of an intrauterine or perinatal compartment syndrome.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: In children with cerebral palsy, flexion deformities of the knee can be treated with a distal femoral extension osteotomy combined with either patellar tendon advancement or patellar tendon shortening. The purpose of this study was to establish a consensus through expert orthopedic opinion, using a modified Delphi process to describe the surgical indications for distal femoral extension osteotomy and patellar tendon advancement/patellar tendon shortening. A literature review was also conducted to summarize the recent literature on distal femoral extension osteotomy and patellar tendon shortening/patellar tendon advancement. METHOD: A group of 16 pediatric orthopedic surgeons, with more than 10 years of experience in the surgical management of children with cerebral palsy, was established. The group used a 5-level Likert-type scale to record agreement or disagreement with statements regarding distal femoral extension osteotomy and patellar tendon advancement/patellar tendon shortening. Consensus for the surgical indications for distal femoral extension osteotomy and patellar tendon advancement/patellar tendon shortening was achieved through a modified Delphi process. The literature review, summarized studies of clinical outcomes of distal femoral extension osteotomy/patellar tendon shortening/patellar tendon advancement, published between 2008 and 2022. RESULTS: There was a high level of agreement with consensus for 31 out of 44 (70%) statements on distal femoral extension osteotomy. Agreement was lower for patellar tendon advancement/patellar tendon shortening with consensus reached for 8 of 21 (38%) of statements. The literature review included 25 studies which revealed variation in operative technique for distal femoral extension osteotomy, patellar tendon advancement, and patellar tendon shortening. Distal femoral extension osteotomy and patellar tendon advancement/patellar tendon shortening were generally effective in correcting knee flexion deformities and extensor lag, but there was marked variation in outcomes and complication rates. CONCLUSION: The results from this study will provide guidelines for surgeons who care for children with cerebral palsy and point to unresolved questions for further research.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The respiratory quotient (RQ), defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide exhaled to oxygen uptake, reflects substrate utilization when energy is expended. Fat and alcohol have RQ values of approximately 0.7, compared with 1.0 for carbohydrate, and approximately 0.8 for protein. Here, the association between RQ and postmenopausal breast cancer risk is studied. METHODS: Paired RQ measurements were obtained, separated by approximately 6 months, for women in the reliability subset of a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Nutrition and Physical Activity Assessment Study. Linear regression of the average of the paired log RQ assessments on a corresponding log food quotient (FQ) average and other study subject characteristics, including age, body mass index, race, and education, yielded calibration equations for predicting RQ. RESULTS: Calibration equations, using any of food frequency, food record, or dietary recall data, explained an appreciable fraction of measured log RQ variation, and these were used to compute calibrated RQ estimates throughout WHI cohorts. Calibrated RQ estimates using 4-day food record (4DFR) data related inversely (P = 0.004) to (invasive) breast cancer risk in the WHI Dietary Modification trial comparison group, and corresponding RQ estimates using food-frequency data related inversely (P = 0.002) to breast cancer incidence in this cohort combined with the larger WHI observational study. CONCLUSION: Although preliminary, these analyses suggest a substantially higher postmenopausal breast cancer risk among women having relatively low RQ. IMPACT: RQ elevation could provide a novel target for breast cancer risk reduction.",

This study involved DNA pools formed from 125 cases or 125 matched controls. Individual genotyping for these SNPs subsequently came available for a substantial majority of women included in seven pool pairs, providing the opportunity for a comparison of pooled DNA and individual odds ratio estimates and their variances. We find that the \"per minor allele\" odds ratio estimates from the pooled DNA comparisons agree fairly well with those from individual genotyping. Furthermore, the log-odds ratio variance estimates support a pooled DNA measurement model that we previously described, although with somewhat greater extra-binomial variation than was hypothesized in project design. Implications for the role of pooled DNA comparisons in the future genetic epidemiology research agenda are discussed.",

METHODS: We measured baseline plasma concentrations of various type 2 diabetes biomarkers in 1,259 incident type 2 diabetes cases and 1,790 controls in the Women's Health Initiative-Observational Study. Self-report birthweights of the participants were recorded. The total effect of LBW on type 2 diabetes risk was partitioned into effects that were mediated by a specific biomarker and effects that were not mediated by this biomarker, using counterfactual model-based mediation analysis. RESULTS: LBW was significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Compared with women with birthweight 3.63-4.54 kg, women with LBW (<2.72 kg) had a multivariable-adjusted OR of 2.15 (95% CI, 1.54, 3.00). Insulin resistance (indicated by HOMA-IR) mediated 47% of the total effect. Decreased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentration accounted for 24%, elevated E-selectin concentration accounted for 25% and increased systolic blood pressure accounted for 8% of the total effect of LBW on type 2 diabetes risk.

CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: LBW is directly predictive of higher risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. The effect of LBW on type 2 diabetes risk seems mainly mediated by insulin resistance, which is further explained by circulating levels of SHBG and E-selectin and systolic blood pressure.

        "abstract": "Identification of new genetic markers may improve the prediction of colorectal cancer prognosis. Our objective was to examine genome-wide associations of germline genetic variants with disease-specific survival in an analysis of 16,964 cases of colorectal cancer. We analyzed genotype and colorectal cancer-specific survival data from a consortium of 15 studies. Approximately 7.5 million SNPs were examined under the log-additive model using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for clinical factors and principal components. Additionally, we ran secondary analyses stratifying by tumor site and disease stage. We used a genome-wide p-value threshold of 5 × 10-8 to assess statistical significance. No variants were statistically significantly associated with disease-specific survival in the full case analysis or in the stage-stratified analyses. Three SNPs were statistically significantly associated with disease-specific survival for cases with tumors located in the distal colon (rs698022, HR = 1.48, CI 1.30-1.69, p = 8.47 × 10-9) and the proximal colon (rs189655236, HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.65-2.77, p = 9.19 × 10-9 and rs144717887, HR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.57-2.58, p = 3.14 × 10-8), whereas no associations were detected for rectal tumors. Findings from this large genome-wide association study highlight the potential for anatomical-site-stratified genome-wide studies to identify germline genetic risk variants associated with colorectal cancer-specific survival. Larger sample sizes and further replication efforts are needed to more fully interpret these findings.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Racial and ethnic groups with higher rates of clinical Alzheimer disease (AD) are underrepresented in studies of AD biomarkers, including amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). OBJECTIVE: To compare amyloid PET positivity among a diverse cohort of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analysis of the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS), a single-arm multisite cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries who met appropriate-use criteria for amyloid PET imaging between February 2016 and September 2017 with follow-up through January 2018. Data were analyzed between April 2020 and January 2022. This study used 2 approaches: the McNemar test to compare amyloid PET positivity proportions between matched racial and ethnic groups and multivariable logistic regression to assess the odds of having a positive amyloid PET scan. IDEAS enrolled participants at 595 US dementia specialist practices. A total of 21 949 were enrolled and 4842 (22%) were excluded from the present analysis due to protocol violations, not receiving an amyloid PET scan, not having a positive or negative scan, or because of small numbers in some subgroups. EXPOSURES: In the IDEAS study, participants underwent a single amyloid PET scan. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were amyloid PET positivity proportions and odds. RESULTS: Data from 17 107 individuals (321 Asian, 635 Black, 829 Hispanic, and 15 322 White) with MCI or dementia and amyloid PET were analyzed between April 2020 and January 2022. The median (range) age of participants was 75 (65-105) years; 8769 participants (51.3%) were female and 8338 (48.7%) were male. In the optimal 1:1 matching analysis (n = 3154), White participants had a greater proportion of positive amyloid PET scans compared with Asian participants (181 of 313; 57.8%; 95% CI, 52.3-63.2 vs 142 of 313; 45.4%; 95% CI, 39.9-50.9, respectively; P = .001) and Hispanic participants (482 of 780; 61.8%; 95% CI, 58.3-65.1 vs 425 of 780; 54.5%; 95% CI, 51.0-58.0, respectively; P = .003) but not Black participants (359 of 615; 58.4%; 95% CI, 54.4-62.2 vs 333 of 615; 54.1%; 95% CI, 50.2-58.0, respectively; P = .13). In the adjusted model, the odds of having a positive amyloid PET scan were lower for Asian participants (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.37-0.59; P < .001), Black participants (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.84; P < .001), and Hispanic participants (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.79; P < .001) compared with White participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Racial and ethnic differences found in amyloid PET positivity among individuals with MCI and dementia in this study may indicate differences in underlying etiology of cognitive impairment and guide future treatment and prevention approaches.",

The extent to which exposure to discrimination and depressive symptoms attenuates the education-cognition link has not been investigated. METHODS: Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans (STAR) participants (n = 764; average age 69 years) completed the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales. We assessed everyday and major lifetime discrimination and depressive symptoms as mediators of education effects on cognition using G-estimation with measurement error corrections. RESULTS: Education was correlated with greater major lifetime and everyday discrimination but lower depressive symptoms. Accounting for discrimination and depressive symptoms slightly reduced the estimated effect of education on cognition. The estimated total effect of graduate education (vs <Bachelor's) was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.68), and the direct effect not mediated by discrimination or depressive symptoms was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.76). DISCUSSION: Education has robust effects on later-life cognition after controlling multiple mediating pathways and offsetting mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modifiable risks for dementia are more prevalent in rural populations, yet there is a dearth of research examining life course rural residence on late-life cognitive decline. METHODS: The association of rural residence and socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood and adulthood with late-life cognitive domains (verbal episodic memory, executive function, and semantic memory) and cognitive decline in the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences cohort was estimated using marginal structural models with stabilized inverse probability weights. RESULTS: After adjusting for time-varying SES, the estimated marginal effect of rural residence in childhood was harmful for both executive function (β = -0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.32, -0.06) and verbal episodic memory (β = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.35, -0.08). Effects of adult rural residence were imprecisely estimated with beneficial point estimates for both executive function (β = 0.19; 95% CI = -0.07, 0.44) and verbal episodic memory (β = 0.24, 95% CI = -0.07, 0.55).

Four distinct categories of segregation and NSES were evaluated for their association with cognitive outcomes (episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function, and spatial ability) using race-specific mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Compared to Black participants living in higher segregation-lower NSES areas, Black participants living in lower segregation-lower NSES areas or higher segregation-higher NSES areas experienced slower decline in episodic memory over time. Compared to NHW participants living in higher segregation-lower NSES areas, NHWs living in lower segregation-higher NSES areas experienced faster decline in spatial ability.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Black students attending predominantly White institutions (PWIs) versus historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) report more harmful discrimination and develop worse mental health outcomes, potentially offsetting the established benefits of college for lowering dementia incidence. METHODS: Black participants in two cohorts (the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences [KHANDLE] and the Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans [STAR]) who had attended college (N = 716) self-reported the college name (classified as HBCU vs. PWI) and completed three waves of executive function (EF) and verbal episodic memory (VEM) assessments. HBCU effects on cognitive level and decline were estimated using adjusted linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: HBCU (vs. PWI) attendees averaged better EF (β = 0.05 [-0.22, 0.32]) and VEM (β = 0.21 [-0.06, 0.46]) at age 70 though neither association was statistically significant. HBCU attendance was associated with slightly faster VEM decline (β = -0.03 [-0.05, 0.00]). DISCUSSION: Harmonized analyses with larger studies are needed to estimate important effects of HBCU attendance. HIGHLIGHTS: Higher education is robustly linked to lower dementia risk, yet Black-White inequities persist among college-educated adults. Black students attending predominantly White institutions (PWIs) versus historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) report more harmful discrimination and develop worse mental health outcomes, which may offset the established benefits of college for lowering dementia incidence. HBCU (vs. non-HBCU) attendees averaged better executive function and verbal episodic memory (VEM) at average age 70, though confidence intervals were wide and associations were not statistically significant, and averaged slightly faster decline in VEM. Harmonized analyses using larger nationally representative studies are likely needed to avoid underestimating the health effects of HBCU attendance.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In developing countries biomass combustion is a frequently used source of domestic energy and may cause indoor air pollution. Carbon monoxide (CO)and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 lm or less (PM2.5)were measured in kitchens using wood or natural gas (NG) in a semi-rural community in Pakistan. Daytime CO and PM2.5 levels were measured for eight continuous hours in 51 wood and 44 NG users from December 2005 to April 2006. The laser photometer PM2.5 (Dustrak, TSI) was calibrated for field conditions and PM2.5 measurements were reduced by a factor of 2.77. CO was measured by an electrochemical monitor (Model T15v, Langan). The arithmetic mean for daytime CO concentration was 29.4 ppm in wood users; significantly higher than 7.5 ppm in NG users (P < 0.001). The arithmetic mean for daytime PM2.5 concentrations was 2.74 mg/m3 in wood users; significantly higher than 0.38 mg/m3 in NG users (P < 0.001). Higher peak levels of CO and PM2.5 were also observed in wood users. Time spent in the kitchen during fuel burning was significantly related to increasing CO and PM2.5 concentrations in wood users.These findings suggest that cooking with wood fuel may lead to hazardous concentrations of CO and PM2.5. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Biomass combustion is frequently used in developing countries for cooking. This study showed very high level of air pollution in kitchens using wood as the cooking fuel. Many people, especially women and children, are vulnerable to exposure to very high levels of air pollutants as they spend time in the kitchen during cooking hours.",

A stratified random sub-sample based on fuel type and median income was taken from an established cohort who delivered a singleton live birth during 2000-02. Eight-hour daytime concentrations were obtained in 51 wood users and 44 NG users from December 2005 to April 2006. None of the cooking areas had chimneys; 86% of wood and 80% of NG users cooked in separate kitchens. Geometric mean (GM) CO concentration in wood users was 19.7 ppm (geometric standard deviation (GSD) 12.1) compared to 5.4 ppm (GSD 2.4) in NG users (p<0.001). Fuel burning duration and time spent in kitchen by participants were correlated (r= 0.72, p<0.01).

        "abstract": "This study examines the influence of the indoor environment on exposure to a suite of air pollutants, designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as hazardous air pollutants (HAP's). The EPA found that several of these compounds were responsible for a large percentage of overall excess cancer risk in the population. However, their analysis only examined outdoor concentrations. To fully quantify human exposure, we need to include the indoor environment, where we spend about 80% of our total time. We assemble data from several monitoring and modeling studies to better understand the average levels of total personal exposure, and to determine the relative contribution of exposure resulting from indoor versus outdoor origin. For many HAP's, indoor concentrations are higher than outdoor concentrations, due to the presence of indoor sources combined with infiltration from outdoor air. We find that many of HAPs examined have a significant proportion of exposure coming from the indoor environment.",

        "abstract": "Many people spend time in stores and restaurants, yet there has been little investigation of the influence of these microenvironments on personal exposure. Relative to the outdoors, transportation, and the home, these microenvironments have high concentrations of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We developed a stochastic model to examine the effect of VOC concentrations in these microenvironments on total personal exposure for (1) non-smoking adults working in offices who spend time in stores and restaurants or bars and (2) non-smoking adults who work in these establishments. We also compared the effect of working in a smoking versus non-smoking restaurant or bar. Input concentrations for each microenvironment were developed from the literature whereas time activity inputs were taken from the National Human Activity Patterns Survey. Time-averaged exposures were simulated for 5000 individuals over a weeklong period for each analysis. Mean contributions to personal exposure from non-working time spent in stores and restaurants or bars range from <5% to 20%, depending on the VOC and time-activity patterns. At the 95th percentile of the distribution of the proportion of personal exposure attributable to time spent in stores and restaurants or bars, these microenvironments can be responsible for over half of a person's total exposure to certain VOCs. People working in restaurants or bars where smoking is allowed had the highest fraction of exposure attributable to their workplace. At the median, people who worked in stores or restaurants tended to have 20-60% of their total exposures from time spent at work. These results indicate that stores and restaurants can be large contributors to personal exposure to VOCs for both workers in those establishments and for a subset of people who visit these places, and that incorporation of these non-residential microenvironments can improve models of personal exposure distributions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this study we compared cancer risks from organic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) based on total personal exposure summed across different microenvironments and exposure pathways. METHODS: We developed distributions of personal exposure concentrations using field monitoring and modeling data for inhalation and, where relevant, ingestion pathways. We calculated risks for a nonoccupationally exposed and nonsmoking population using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Office of Environmental Health and Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) unit risks. We determined the contribution to risk from indoor versus outdoor sources using indoor/outdoor ratios for gaseous compounds and the infiltration factor for particle-bound compounds. RESULTS: With OEHHA's unit risks, the highest ranking compounds based on the population median are 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, benzene, and dioxin, with risks on the order of 10(-4)-10(-5). The highest risk compounds with the U.S. EPA unit risks were dioxin, benzene, formaldehyde, and chloroform, with risks on a similar order of magnitude. Although indoor exposures are responsible for nearly 70% of risk using OEHHA's unit risks, when infiltration is accounted for, inhalation of outdoor sources contributed 50% to total risk, on average. Additionally, 15% of risk resulted from exposures through food, mainly due to dioxin. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzene, acetaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene risk came from outdoor sources, whereas indoor sources were primarily responsible for chloroform, formaldehyde, and naphthalene risks. The infiltration of outdoor pollution into buildings, emissions from indoor sources, and uptake through food are all important to consider in reducing overall personal risk to HAPs.",

        "abstract": "Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCT) is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by short stature, and fusions of the vertebrae and carpal and tarsal bones. SCT results from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for nonsense mutations in FLNB. FLNB encodes filamin B, a multifunctional cytoplasmic protein that plays a critical role in skeletal development. Protein extracts derived from cells of SCT patients with nonsense mutations in FLNB did not contain filamin B, demonstrating that SCT results from absence of filamin B. To understand the role of filamin B in skeletal development, an Flnb-/- mouse model was generated. The Flnb-/- mice were phenotypically similar to individuals with SCT as they exhibited short stature and similar skeletal abnormalities. Newborn Flnb-/- mice had fusions between the neural arches of the vertebrae in the cervical and thoracic spine. At postnatal day 60, the vertebral fusions were more widespread and involved the vertebral bodies as well as the neural arches. In addition, fusions were seen in sternum and carpal bones. Analysis of the Flnb-/- mice phenotype showed that an absence of filamin B causes progressive vertebral fusions, which is contrary to the previous hypothesis that SCT results from failure of normal spinal segmentation. These findings suggest that spinal segmentation can occur normally in the absence of filamin B, but the protein is required for maintenance of intervertebral, carpal and sternal joints, and the joint fusion process commences antenatally.",

        "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) now represents nearly a quarter of newly diagnosed breast cancers in the United States. Standard-of-care treatment for DCIS is aggressive local therapy consisting of either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with radiation. However, DCIS mortality is low regardless of initial treatment, suggesting opportunities to explore a spectrum of treatment options. With these treatment options, there is the potential to create risk-adapted treatment plans, but the question of how to assess risk remains. Molecular tests can help to personalize treatment by stratifying disease sub-types and providing prognosis. One such tool is the Oncotype DX® Breast DCIS Score, a risk measure which was validated in a meta-analysis of 773 patients from the E5194 and Ontario DCIS Cohort studies. Along with calculating a Breast DCIS Score™ from the expression levels of 12 genes, the test provides a predicted 10-year risk of local recurrence from the score result, age, and tumor size for patients who receive breast conserving surgery alone. Understanding how such a tool might impact decision-making will inform its implementation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Eligibility &amp; trial design: The ATHENA Breast Health Network is a consortium of the five University of California Medical centers. Through ATHENA, patients with histologically confirmed DCIS and no concurrent invasive cancer are approached to participate in the Athena DCIS Registry. Patients in the registry facing an active management decision are eligible to participate in the Oncotype DX® DCIS prospective study.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Specific aims: The primary aim of the study is to determine whether the additional diagnostic information (i.e. the DCIS Score™) impacts patient treatment decisions and physician recommendation. Additional goals are to correlate the DCIS Score™ with mammographic findings, pathological variables, and treatment recommendations, and to estimate risk within each DCIS Score™ group. Participants and their physicians answer survey questions both before and after receiving the score to evaluate the impact of the DCIS Score™ on treatment recommendations and decisions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Statistical methods: The study will assess the percentage of patients who thought the DCIS risk score influenced their treatment decision. The study will also assess whether a significant proportion of physicians changed their recommendations after considering the DCIS Score™ using the chi-square test. Similarly, the patients’ preferred treatment option pre- and post- test surveys will be evaluated. In addition, the concordance between physicians’ and patients’ choices will be assessed by the Kappa statistic before and after the score. The patients’ and physicians’ confidence levels in their treatment recommendation and decision pre- and post- test will be compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as well as the percentage of patients and physicians who are glad they used the test. In addition, the study will assess whether the DCIS test influences a patient’s perception of their recurrence risk by comparing the self-reported 10-year breast cancer recurrence risk in their pre- and post- test questionnaires using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Current and target accrual: The current accrual across all sites in the Oncotype study is 94 patients.

While tissue culture models are extremely useful in understanding the biology of prostate cancer, they cannot recapitulate the complex cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment that play a key role in cancer initiation and progression. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium convened a group of human and veterinary pathologists to review the current animal models of prostate cancer and make recommendations about the pathologic analysis of these models. More than 40 different models with 439 samples were reviewed, including genetically engineered mouse models, xenograft, rat, and canine models. Numerous relevant models have been developed over the past 15 years, and each approach has strengths and weaknesses. Analysis of multiple genetically engineered models has shown that reactive stroma formation is present in all the models developing invasive carcinomas. In addition, numerous models with multiple genetic alterations display aggressive phenotypes characterized by sarcomatoid carcinomas and metastases, which is presumably a histologic manifestation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The significant progress in development of improved models of prostate cancer has already accelerated our understanding of the complex biology of prostate cancer and promises to enhance development of new approaches to prevention, detection, and treatment of this common malignancy.",

        "abstract": "In human prostate cancer, the frequent down-regulation of p27(kip1) protein expression is correlated with poor clinical outcome, yet p27(kip1) rarely undergoes mutational inactivation. Here, we investigate the consequences of reducing or eliminating p27(kip1) function for prostate carcinogenesis in the context of a mouse modeling lacking the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene and the Pten tumor suppressor. Unexpectedly, we find that triple mutant mice heterozygous for a p27(kip1) null allele (Nkx3.1(+/- or -/-); Pten(+/-); p27(+/-)) display enhanced prostate carcinogenesis, whereas mice that are homozygous null for p27(kip1) (Nkx3.1(+/- or -/-); Pten(+/-); p27(-/-)) show inhibition of cancer progression. Expression profiling reveals that Cyclin D1 is highly up-regulated in compound p27(kip1) heterozygotes, but is down-regulated in the compound p27(kip1) homozygous mutants. Using RNA interference in prostate cancer cell lines with distinct p27(kip1) gene doses, we show that prostate tumorigenicity depends on levels of p27(kip1) and that the consequences of p27(kip1) gene dosage can be attributed, in part, to altered levels of Cyclin D1. Our findings suggest that p27(kip1) possesses dosage-sensitive positive as well as negative modulatory roles in prostate cancer progression.",

        "abstract": "Classification of histology sections in large cohorts, in terms of distinct regions of microanatomy (e.g., stromal) and histopathology (e.g., tumor, necrosis), enables the quantification of tumor composition, and the construction of predictive models of genomics and clinical outcome. To tackle the large technical variations and biological heterogeneities, which are intrinsic in large cohorts, emerging systems utilize either prior knowledge from pathologists or unsupervised feature learning for invariant representation of the underlying properties in the data. However, to a large degree, the architecture for tissue histology classification remains unexplored and requires urgent systematical investigation. This paper is the first attempt to provide insights into three fundamental questions in tissue histology classification: I. Is unsupervised feature learning preferable to human engineered features? II. Does cellular saliency help? III. Does the sparse feature encoder contribute to recognition? We show that (a) in I, both Cellular Morphometric Feature and features from unsupervised feature learning lead to superior performance when compared to SIFT and [Color, Texture]; (b) in II, cellular saliency incorporation impairs the performance for systems built upon pixel-/patch-level features; and (c) in III, the effect of the sparse feature encoder is correlated with the robustness of features, and the performance can be consistently improved by the multi-stage extension of systems built upon both Cellular Morphmetric Feature and features from unsupervised feature learning. These insights are validated with two cohorts of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC).",

        "abstract": "The grapevine is an economically important plant, with a historical connection to the development of human culture. Currently, over 6000 accessions are known as individual grapevine varieties, some of which are important to national heritage, valuable for current viticultural practices, and as genetic resources to maintain plasticity under changing climatic conditions, environmental sustainability, and market demands. Recently, the diversity of cultivated grapevines has declined significantly, due to the increased focus of global wine industries on a few major cultivars. Moreover, due to biotic and abiotic stresses, the wild V. vinifera germplasm's genetic diversity has declined, with some varieties on the verge of extinction. Vitis germplasm conservation can be achieved via either in situ (e.g., protected areas) or Ex situ (e.g., field collections, seed banks, and tissue culture collections) methods. This study aims to highlight the importance of Vitis field bank collections. We demonstrate the research done in the Israeli indigenous Vitis vinifera collection. The multi-layer analysis of the varieties enabled the identification of drought stress-resistant varieties, and suggested a mechanism for this resistance through noting the dramatic phenological differences in foliage development between resistant and sensitive varieties. In addition, we show a general characterization of the varieties via major grape characteristics, including bunch and berry shape, as well as their possible utilization based on their aromatic and phenolic profiles.",

The causal bacterium, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', presents a sampling issue for qPCR diagnostics and results in a high false negative rate. In this work, we compared six metabolomics assays to identify HLB-infected citrus trees from leaf tissue extracted from 30 control and 30 HLB-infected trees. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based assay was most accurate. A final partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was trained and validated on 690 leaf samples with corresponding qPCR measures from three citrus varieties (Rio Red grapefruit, Hamlin sweet orange, and Valencia sweet orange) from orchards in Florida and Texas. Trees were naturally infected with HLB transmitted by the insect vector Diaphorina citri. In a randomized validation set, the assay was 99.9% accurate to classify diseased from nondiseased samples. This model was applied to samples from trees receiving plant defense-inducer compounds or biological treatments to prevent or cure HLB infection. From two trials, HLB-related metabolite abundances and PLS-DA scores were tracked longitudinally and compared with those of control trees. We demonstrate how our assay can assess tree health and the efficacy of HLB treatments and conclude that no trialed treatment was efficacious.",

        "issued": "2016-02",
        "abstract": "Methoxypyrazines are volatile compounds found in plants, microbes, and insects that have potent vegetal and earthy aromas. With sensory detection thresholds in the low ng L(-1) range, modest concentrations of these compounds can profoundly impact the aroma quality of foods and beverages, and high levels can lead to consumer rejection. The wine industry routinely analyzes the most prevalent methoxypyrazine, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), to aid in harvest decisions, since concentrations decrease during berry ripening. In addition to IBMP, three other methoxypyrazines IPMP (2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine), SBMP (2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine), and EMP (2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine) have been identified in grapes and/or wine and can impact aroma quality. Despite their routine analysis in the wine industry (mostly IBMP), accurate methoxypyrazine quantitation is hindered by two major challenges: sensitivity and resolution. With extremely low sensory detection thresholds (~8-15 ng L(-1) in wine for IBMP), highly sensitive analytical methods to quantify methoxypyrazines at trace levels are necessary. Here we were able to achieve resolution of IBMP as well as IPMP, EMP, and SBMP from co-eluting compounds using one-dimensional chromatography coupled to positive chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Three extraction techniques HS-SPME (headspace-solid phase microextraction), SBSE (stirbar sorptive extraction), and HSSE (headspace sorptive extraction) were validated and compared. A 30 min extraction time was used for HS-SPME and SBSE extraction techniques, while 120 min was necessary to achieve sufficient sensitivity for HSSE extractions. All extraction methods have limits of quantitation (LOQ) at or below 1 ng L(-1) for all four methoxypyrazines analyzed, i.e., LOQ's at or below reported sensory detection limits in wine. The method is high throughput, with resolution of all compounds possible with a relatively rapid 27 min GC oven program.",

        "abstract": "Background - Sorbitol is the main translocated carbohydrate in species belonging to Rosaceae. It is thought to be a key molecule for the measurement of sink strength in apple. The quantity of sorbitol in plant tissues depends on the different factors such as species, development and physiological status, and type of tissues. Objective - An analysis of metabolic changes in primary metabolism was conducted in vegetative sinks of apple transgenic plants with altered sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the transgenic modulation of the SDH gene in carbohydrate partitioning and primary metabolism. Methods - Three antisenses and one sense transgenic line of cv. 'Greensleaves' were obtained for sorbi-tol dehydrogenase and grown in pots in a controlled environment. Results - The two antisense lines A041703/H and A111802/25 showed a reduced SDH activity similarly to antisense lines previously characterized. The three antisense lines showed alterations of three different carbohydrates, one for each plant. A090802-1 showed an increase in sorbitol while A041703/H showed an increase in fructose. The last one, A111802/25, presented an increase in glucose. In vegetative sink tissues of A090802-1 a higher level of amino acids was observed such as lysine, thre-onine, serine, glutamic acid, and glycine. These metabolic changes were associated with loss of apical dominance, reduced growth of leaf and whole plant. While threonine was also enhanced in A041703/H, ornithine was reduced in A111802/25 and consequently linked with the decrease in citrulline. Stearic acid was reduced in all three antisense transgenic lines. Conclusions - These results highlight the key role of sorbitol dehydrogenase in the establishment of sink-source relationships.",

Their role in plant defense response suggests that they may be useful for genetic engineering to obtain transgenic plants with increased tolerance to fungal infection. In addition, the fact that Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of Pierce's Disease (PD) in grapevines, has genes putatively encoding PG and other cell wall-degrading enzymes led us to the hypothesis that PGIP could confer resistance against this bacterium. In order to test this hypothesis, proembryogenic calli originating from anthers of Vitis vinifera cvs. Thompson Seedless and Chardonnay were co-cultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA 101 harboring binary plasmid pDU94.0928 that contains the pear pgip gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Plants from 51 independently isolated lines have been transferred to the greenhouse. Putative transgenic lines growing in the greenhouse were analyzed by PCR, Western blotting and PGIP activity assays. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of the protein in roots, leaves and young stems of the transgenic plants but not in untransformed controls. High levels of enzyme activity have been found in crude extracts from leaves of transgenic lines obtained from independent transformation events but not in untransformed controls. Preliminary results have shown that the development of PD in the transgenic lines analyzed so far is delayed. We also present results regarding the disease response of greenhouse-grown plants after inoculation with Botrytis cinerea.",

        "abstract": "Ebola, considered till recently as a rare and endemic disease, has dramatically transformed into a potentially global humanitarian crisis. The genome of Ebola, a member of the Filoviridae family, encodes seven proteins. Based on the recently implemented software (PAGAL) for analyzing the hydrophobicity and amphipathicity properties of alpha helices (AH) in proteins, we characterize the helices in the Ebola proteome. We demonstrate that AHs with characteristically unique features are involved in critical interactions with the host proteins. For example, the Ebola virus membrane fusion subunit, GP2, from the envelope glycoprotein ectodomain has an AH with a large hydrophobic moment. The neutralizing antibody (KZ52) derived from a human survivor of the 1995 Kikwit outbreak recognizes a protein epitope on this AH, emphasizing the critical nature of this secondary structure in the virulence of the Ebola virus. Our method ensures a comprehensive list of such `hotspots'. These helices probably are or can be the target of molecules designed to inhibit AH mediated protein-protein interactions. Further, by comparing the AHs in proteins of the related Marburg viruses, we are able to elicit subtle changes in the proteins that might render them ineffective to previously successful drugs. Such differences are difficult to identify by a simple sequence or structural alignment. Thus, analyzing AHs in the small Ebola proteome can aid rational design aimed at countering the `largest Ebola epidemic, affecting multiple countries in West Africa' ( http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html).",

        "abstract": "Duplication of genes is one of the preferred ways for natural selection to add advantageous functionality to the genome without having to reinvent the wheel with respect to catalytic efficiency and protein stability. The duplicated secretory virulence factors of Xylella fastidiosa (LesA, LesB and LesC), implicated in Pierce's disease of grape and citrus variegated chlorosis of citrus species, epitomizes the positive selection pressures exerted on advantageous genes in such pathogens. A deeper insight into the evolution of these lipases/esterases is essential to develop resistance mechanisms in transgenic plants. Directed evolution, an attempt to accelerate the evolutionary steps in the laboratory, is inherently simple when targeted for loss of function. A bigger challenge is to specify mutations that endow a new function, such as a lost functionality in a duplicated gene. Previously, we have proposed a method for enumerating candidates for mutations intended to transfer the functionality of one protein into another related protein based on the spatial and electrostatic properties of the active site residues (DECAAF). In the current work, we present in vivo validation of DECAAF by inducing tributyrin hydrolysis in LesB based on the active site similarity to LesA. The structures of these proteins have been modeled using RaptorX based on the closely related LipA protein from Xanthomonas oryzae. These mutations replicate the spatial and electrostatic conformation of LesA in the modeled structure of the mutant LesB as well, providing in silico validation before proceeding to the laborious in vivo work. Such focused mutations allows one to dissect the relevance of the duplicated genes in finer detail as compared to gene knockouts, since they do not interfere with other moonlighting functions, protein expression levels or protein-protein interaction.",

        "abstract": "Alpha helices (AH) are peptide fragments characterized by regular patterns of hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen and amino nitrogen of residues regularly spaced in sequence, resulting in spiral conformations. Their preponderance in protein structures underlines their importance. Interestingly, AHs are present in most anti-microbial peptides, although they might remain in random-coil conformations depending on the solvent dielectric. For example, the cecropin component of the chimeric anti-microbial protein designed previously by our group comprises of two AHs linked by a short stretch of random coil. These anti-microbial peptides are often amphipathic (quantified by a hydrophobic moment), aligning hydrophobic residues on one surface and charged residues on the others. In the current work, we reproduce previously described computational methods to compute the hydrophobic moment of AHs - and provide open access to the source code (PAGAL). We simultaneously generated input files for TikZ (a package for creating high resolution graphics programmatically) to obtain the Edmundson wheel and showing the direction and magnitude of the hydrophobic moment, and Pymol scripts to generate color coded protein surfaces. Additionally, we have observed an empirical structural property of AHs: the distance between the Cα atoms of the ith and (i+4)th residue is equal to the distance between the carbonyl oxygens of the ith and (i+4)th residue. We validated this using 100 non-homologous high resolution structures from the PISCES database.

        "abstract": "Nitrogen is an essential element required for plant growth and productivity. Understanding the mechanisms and natural genetic variation underlying nitrogen use in plants will facilitate the engineering of plant nitrogen use to maximize crop productivity while minimizing environmental costs. To understand the scope of natural variation that may influence nitrogen use, we grew 1,135 Arabidopsis thaliana natural genotypes on two nitrogen sources, nitrate and ammonium, and measured both developmental and defense metabolite traits. By using different environments and focusing on multiple traits, we identified a wide array of different nitrogen responses. These responses are associated with numerous genes, most of which were not previously associated with nitrogen responses. Only a small portion of these genes appear to be shared between environments or traits, while most are predominantly specific to a developmental or defense trait under a specific nitrogen source. Finally, by using a large population, we were able to identify unique nitrogen responses, such as preferring ammonium or nitrate, which appear to be generated by combinations of loci rather than a few large-effect loci. This suggests that it may be possible to obtain novel phenotypes in complex nitrogen responses by manipulating sets of genes with small effects rather than solely focusing on large-effect single gene manipulations.",

        "abstract": "The rhizosphere microbiome influences many aspects of plant fitness, including production of secondary compounds and defence against insect herbivores. Plants also modulate the composition of the microbial community in the rhizosphere via secretion of root exudates. We tested both the effect of the rhizosphere microbiome on plant traits, and host plant effects on rhizosphere microbes using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Brassica rapa that differ in production of glucosinolates (GLS), secondary metabolites that contribute to defence against insect herbivores. First, we investigated the effect of genetic variation in GLS production on the composition of the rhizosphere microbiome. Using a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression model (DMBVS), we identified both negative and positive associations between bacteria from six genera and the concentration of five GLS compounds produced in plant roots. Additionally, we tested the effects of microbial inoculation (an intact vs. disrupted soil microbiome) on GLS production and insect damage in these RILs. We found a significant microbial treatment × genotype interaction, in which total GLS was higher in the intact relative to the disrupted microbiome treatment in some RILs. However, despite differences in GLS production between microbial treatments, we observed no difference in insect damage between treatments. Together, these results provide evidence for a full feedback cycle of plant-microbe interactions mediated by GLS; that is, GLS compounds produced by the host plant \"feed-down\" to influence rhizosphere microbial community and rhizosphere microbes \"feed-up\" to influence GLS production.",

While mutation rates are often regarded as constant, variability in mutation rates has been observed at nearly every level-varying across mutation types, genome locations, gene functions, epigenomic contexts, environmental conditions, genotypes, and species. This mutation rate variation arises from differential rates of DNA damage, repair, and transposable element activation and insertion that together produce what is measured by DNA mutation rates. We review historical and recent investigations into the causes and consequences of mutation rate variability in plants by focusing on the mechanisms shaping this variation. Emerging mechanistic models point to the evolvability of mutation rate variation across genomes via mechanisms that target DNA repair, shaping the diversification of plants at phenotypic and genomic scales.",

This two-category system for defensive phytochemicals based on plant-production has been widely used but reinforces misconceptions about non-phytoalexin phytochemicals. We propose that defensive phytochemicals synthesized from preformed constituents, typically as a consequence of tissue damage, should be classified separately from phytoanticipins as phytoavengins. In addition, we highlight the potential advantages of shifting towards focusing on the diverse modes-of-action and ecological contexts of defensive phytochemicals.",

        "abstract": "Bidirectional flow of information shapes the outcome of the host-pathogen interactions and depends on the genetics of each organism. Recent work has begun to use co-transcriptomic studies to shed light on this bidirectional flow, but it is unclear how plastic the co-transcriptome is in response to genetic variation in both the host and pathogen. To study co-transcriptome plasticity, we conducted transcriptomics using natural genetic variation in the pathogen, Botrytis cinerea, and large-effect genetic variation abolishing defense signaling pathways within the host, Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that genetic variation in the pathogen has a greater influence on the co-transcriptome than mutations that abolish defense signaling pathways in the host. Genome-wide association mapping using the pathogens' genetic variation and both organisms' transcriptomes allowed an assessment of how the pathogen modulates plasticity in response to the host. This showed that the differences in both organism's responses were linked to trans-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) hotspots within the pathogen's genome. These hotspots control gene sets in either the host or pathogen and show differential allele sensitivity to the host's genetic variation rather than qualitative host specificity. Interestingly, nearly all the trans-eQTL hotspots were unique to the host or pathogen transcriptomes. In this system of differential plasticity, the pathogen mediates the shift in the co-transcriptome more than the host.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Hispanic/Latinx adults are at increased risk for cognitive impairment, and it is critically important to identify modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment in this population. We addressed two key questions: (1) How does perceived discrimination change across middle adulthood? And, (2) how are discrimination and the trajectory of discrimination associated with cognitive function? METHODS: We used data from 1,110 Mexican-origin adults between 26 and 62 years old (63% female; 85% born in Mexico). Participants completed a perceived ethnic discrimination scale five times across 12 years and completed cognitive assessments in the last wave, which were composited into a measure of overall cognitive function. We used latent growth curve models to estimate the longitudinal trajectory of perceived ethnic discrimination and growth mixture models to identify sub-groups of change trajectories. We evaluated whether patterns of perceived discrimination trajectories, baseline, intermediary, and concurrent discrimination predicted cognitive function at the last wave. RESULTS: Perceived ethnic discrimination decreased over time on average. Significant individual differences in within-person change revealed two change trajectory classes: Stable Low and High Declining. The Stable Low class had better cognitive performance compared to the High Declining class, but this effect was not robust to educational attainment. Perceived discrimination at the last wave was associated with worse cognitive function, and this effect remained after accounting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to evaluate changes in perceived ethnic discrimination in a sample of Mexican-origin adults and their associations with cognitive function. The results highlight the need for more research to better understand the role of discrimination and other social stressors on cognitive health outcomes.",

Developmental trajectories of adolescent temperament (Effortful Control, Negative Emotionality, and Positive Emotionality) may help us predict who will experience anxiety/depression during young adulthood. The present study used longitudinal data from a large, community sample of Mexican-origin youth (N = 674) to examine how temperament develops across adolescence (age 10–16) and whether the developmental trajectories of temperament are associated with anxiety/depression during young adulthood (ages 19 and 21). Results indicate that Effortful Control, Negatively Emotionality, and the Affiliation facet of Positive Emotionality tend to decrease across adolescence, whereas Surgency tends to increase. Smaller decreases in Effortful Control and greater increases in Positive Emotionality across adolescence were associated with fewer anxiety/depression symptoms during young adulthood, whereas smaller decreases in Negative Emotionality were associated with more anxiety/depression symptoms later on. Thus, temperament development serves as both a protective factor (Effortful Control, Positive Emotionality) and a risk factor (Negative Emotionality) for later anxiety/depression in Mexican-origin youth.",

More Latino adolescents report suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors (STBs) than youths of most other ethnic communities. Yet few studies have examined multiple psychosocial predictors of STBs in Latino youths using multiyear longitudinal designs. In this study, we evaluated the progression of STBs in 674 Mexican-origin youths (50% female) from fifth grade (10 years old) to 12th grade (17 years old) and identified psychosocial predictors of changes in STBs across this period. Latent growth curve models revealed that being female and later-generation status were associated with increasing prevalence in STBs across adolescence. Family conflict and peer conflict predicted increased STBs, whereas greater familism predicted less STBs. Thus, interpersonal relationships and cultural values contribute to the development of STBs in Mexican-origin youths and may be key levers for decreasing suicidality in this understudied but rapidly growing portion of the U.S. adolescent population.",

Six hundred and seventy-four Mexican-origin youth reported their global and domain-specific self-esteem and relational aggression (perpetration and victimization) in the fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh grades. Our findings suggest that: (a) being a perpetrator is prospectively associated with later lower opposite-sex relationships self-esteem at the between-person level, (b) lower self-esteem in the domain of honesty-trustworthiness is prospectively associated with becoming a perpetrator and a victim at the within- and between-person level, (c) lower global self-esteem is prospectively associated with higher victimization at the between-person level, and (d) being victimized is not prospectively associated with later global or domain-specific self-esteem, at neither the within- nor the between-person level.

        "abstract": "This paper used cross-lagged panel models to test the longitudinal interplay between maternal cultural socialization, peer ethnic-racial discrimination, and ethnic-racial pride across 5th to 11th grade among Mexican American youth (N = 674, Mage  = 10.86; 72% born in the United States; 50% girls; Wave 1 collected 2006-2008). Maternal cultural socialization predicted increases in subsequent youth ethnic-racial pride, and youth ethnic-racial pride prompted greater maternal cultural socialization. However, peer ethnic-racial discrimination was associated with subsequent decreases in ethnic-racial pride. The magnitude of these associations was consistent across 5th to 11th grades suggesting that maternal cultural socialization messages are necessary to maintain ethnic-racial pride across adolescence, thus families must continually support the development of ethnic-racial pride in their youth to counter the effects of discrimination.",

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort of 948 newborns underwent CCHD screening near sea-level (n = 463) vs 6250 ft altitude (n = 485) over 3 years. Standard SpO2 pass threshold ≥95% and lower SpO2 pass threshold ≥93% (high-altitude screen) were applied to first measurements to compare pass frequencies. RESULTS: The median SpO2 was lower in high-altitude newborns (96% vs 99%-p < 0.001). The high-altitude newborns passed the AAP algorithm first screen less often (89.3% vs 99.6%-p < 0.001). With the high-altitude algorithm, 98% of high-altitude newborns passed the first screen. CONCLUSION: Lowering the SpO2 pass threshold by 2% at >6000 ft, significantly increased first screen pass rate. Adjustments for altitude may reduce nursing time to conduct repeat measurements and prevent transfers for echocardiograms. Larger studies are necessary to assess impact on false negatives.",

In the past three decades, the advent of surfactant, newer modalities of ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, other pulmonary vasodilators, and finally extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have made giant strides in improving the outcomes of infants with PPHN. However, death or the need for ECMO occurs in 10-20% of term infants with PPHN. Better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of PPHN can lead to physiology-driven management strategies. This manuscript reviews the fetal circulation, cardiopulmonary transition at birth, etiology, and pathophysiology of PPHN.",

STUDY DESIGN: We followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and searched Medline (PubMed interphase), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase and Cochrane Registry between January 1990 and April 2022 for the studies that examined the effect of LMA in delivering PPV compared with the FM or ETT in infants during neonatal resuscitation. We included the studies conducted in LMIC only. We assessed the quality of all the included studies using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) recommendations. RESULTS: Our search resulted in eight randomised studies Six studies compared LMA with FM and three studies compared LMA with ETT. When used as the primary device for providing PPV, the LMA as compared with FM resulted in a significant lower failure rate (relative risk (RR) 0.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.43) with moderate certainty of evidence (CoE) and lesser need for intubation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.58) with low CoE. There was no difference in the incidence of encephalopathy, neonatal admission, need for advanced resuscitations or death. No differences were observed between LMA and ETT. Studies comparing LMA to ETT were limited for any conceivable conclusion. CONCLUSION: LMA is more effective than FM in delivering PPV with less failure rates and reduced need for intubation during neonatal resuscitation in term infants and in LMIC without any difference in the incidence of encephalopathy or death. Studies comparing LMA to ETT are scarce with important methodological limitations. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021283478.",

Starting with a posteriori channel model, we formulate the robust precoder design to maximize an upper bound of ergodic weighted sum-rate under a total power budget. We derive the generalized eigenvector structure for optimal precoder with matrix manifold optimization. However, since the precoding of multiple users is coupled in the structure, we maximize the objective function for each user in alternation and prove the solution of each individual problem is the generalized eigenvector corresponding to the maximum generalized eigenvalue. In accordance with this, we present an iterative algorithm to design the precoder. Furthermore, we propose a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) for higher efficiency in the precoder design algorithm.",

However, due to the huge varieties in distribution of UEs and different physical environments, presenting a comprehensive analytical framework is quite challenging. From this aspect, most available studies on vertical sectorization are limited to present only empirical results. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to forecast the performance of NB-IoT systems over urban scenarios. In particular, a logistic distribution-based analytical framework is exploited in order to calculate the group probabilities for each available UE. Based on these probabilities, we propose a scheduling framework with beamforming which improves physical resource block (PRB) utilization by over 50% compared to the case with no scheduling.",

In applications such as grant-free access by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, accurately identifying a specific irregular interleaving pattern within an interleaver period is vital to both terminal recognition and data recovery. In this work, we investigate effective approaches for random interleaving pattern identification in Reed-Solomon (RS) coded data streams. We first propose an algorithm of low computational complexity to detect positions of code symbols belonging to the same RS codeword group (RSCG) under modest bit error rate. We further develop another low-complexity algorithm to successfully identify random interleaving patterns for RS code symbols within each RS codeword under moderate to high error rate applications. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results corroborate to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.",

We focus on a computation power consumption model based on CMOS devices and a communication power consumption model involving multiple antenna transceivers against mutual interference. We present a joint optimization problem for workload scheduling and power allocation for achieving maximum computational speed under total power constraint. We simplify the joint optimization into two sub-problems. For workload scheduling as an integer programming sub-problem, we relax the integer constraint and establish the equivalence between relaxed and original problems. For the power allocation sub-problem, we maximize a difference of convex functions by utilizing the concave-convex procedure. We prove our proposed algorithm to converge to a stationary point of the original program. Simulation results confirm the efficiency and near-optimal performance of our proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study sought to uncover factors that influence decisions to offer curative-intent surgery for patients with advanced-stage (stage IIIB/IV) non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: A trained interviewer conducted open-ended, semistructured telephone interviews with cardiothoracic surgeons in the United States. Participants were recruited from the Thoracic Surgery Outcomes Research Network, with subsequent diversification through snowball sampling. Four hypothetical clinical scenarios were presented, each demonstrating varying levels of ambiguity with respect to international guideline recommendations. Interviews continued until thematic saturation was reached. Interview transcripts were coded using inductive reasoning and conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Of the 27 participants, most had been in practice for ≤20 years (n = 23) and were in academic practice (n = 18). When considering nonguideline-concordant surgeries, participants were aware of relevant guidelines but acknowledged their limitations for unique scenarios. Surgeons perceived that a common barrier to offering surgery is incomplete nonsurgeon physician understanding of surgical capabilities or expected morbidity; and that improved education is necessary to correct these misperceptions. Surgeons expressed concern that undertaking a controversial resection for an individual patient could fracture trust built in long-term professional relationships. Surgeons may face pressure from patients to operate despite a low expectation of clinical benefit, leading to emotional turmoil for the patient and surgeon. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study generates the hypothesis that the scope of current guidelines, availability of clinical trial protocols, perceived surgical knowledge among nonsurgeon colleagues, interprofessional relationships, and emotional pressure all influence a surgeon's willingness to offer curative-intent surgery for patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Security failures in software arising from failures to practice secure programming are commonplace. Improving this situation requires that practitioners have a clear understanding of the foundational concepts in secure programming to serve as a basis for building new knowledge and responding to new challenges. We developed a Secure Programing Concept Inventory (SPCI) to measure students' understanding of foundational concepts in secure programming. The SPCI consists of thirty-five multiple choice items targeting ten concept areas of secure programming. The SPCI was developed by establishing the content domain of secure programming, developing a pool of test items, multiple rounds of testing and refining the items, and finally testing and inventory reduction to produce the final scale. Scale development began by identifying the core concepts in secure programming. A Delphi study was conducted with thirty practitioners from industry, academia, and government to establish the foundational concepts of secure programming and develop a concept map. To build a set of misconceptions in secure programming, the researchers conducted interviews with students and instructors in the field. These interviews were analyzed using content analysis. This resulted in a taxonomy of misconceptions in secure programming covering ten concept areas. An item pool of multiple-choice questions was developed. The item pool of 225 was administered to a population of 690 students across four institutions. Item discrimination and item difficulty scores were calculated, and the best performing items were mapped to the misconception categories to create subscales for each concept area resulting in a validated 35 item scale.",

Existing curricular guidelines describe topics in computer security, but do not instantiate them with examples. This is because their goals are different. In this case study, we map the e-voting curriculum into the CSEC2017 curriculum guidelines, to demonstrate how such a mapping is done. Further, this enables teachers to select the parts of the e-voting curriculum most relevant to their classes, by basing the selection on the relevant CSEC2017 learning objectives. We conclude with a brief discussion on generalizing this mapping to other curricular guidelines.",

        "abstract": "An attack surface enumerates resources accessible to an attacker for cyber attacks on a system. These resources are: methods that can be called as part of an attack; channels that an attacker outside the system can use to get to a system's interface; and untrusted data that an attacker can use in conjunction with the system's programs and channels. Historically, a system's attacks surface has provided a metric on the vulnerability of a system, in part to compare two systems' exposure to attack. In this paper we extend the attack surface to (1) include rules on the system's methods and channels that if enforced would prevent many attacks, and (2) be a composition of more primitive surfaces each characterizing vulnerabilities associated with types of resources, application-specific or system-specific, e.g., files, directories, and channels. We also introduce two additional surfaces. The defense surface identifies system mechanisms that can thwart cyber-attacks through prevention, or through detection followed by mitigation of an attack in progress and then system restoration. The policy surface defines the security policy of a system as reflected by constraints on its interface expected to be satisfied in the system's operation. The security policy for a corporation would include steps the organization takes to prevent attacks and actions required to address a security incident. More relevant to this paper, the security policy for a community of autonomous vehicles would specify the minimum separation among vehicles that must be maintained even in the presence of a cyber-attack, i.e. a (safety) property. Through an analysis of the intersection of the three surfaces, it is, in principle, possible to determine if a defense exists for every attack that causes a policy violation. And, through computationally-efficient model checking, the defense action can be identified. If more than one defense action exists, model checking will identify all of them, thus enabling the selection of the optimal action based on criteria associated with a CAV.",

The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope will soon usher in a new era, pushing the UV spectroscopic frontier to higher redshifts than ever before; however, its success hinges on a comprehensive understanding of the massive star populations and gas conditions that power the observed UV spectral features. This requires a level of detail that is only possible with a combination of ample wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise, spectral-resolution, and sample diversity that has not yet been achieved by any FUV spectral database. We present the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph Legacy Spectroscopic Survey (CLASSY) treasury and its first high-level science product, the CLASSY atlas. CLASSY builds on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive to construct the first high-quality (S/N1500 Å ≳ 5/resel), high-resolution (R ∼ 15,000) FUV spectral database of 45 nearby (0.002 < z < 0.182) star-forming galaxies. The CLASSY atlas, available to the public via the CLASSY website, is the result of optimally extracting and coadding 170 archival+new spectra from 312 orbits of HST observations. The CLASSY sample covers a broad range of properties including stellar mass (6.2 < log M ⋆(M ⊙) < 10.1), star formation rate (−2.0 < log SFR (M ⊙ yr−1) < +1.6), direct gas-phase metallicity (7.0 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.8), ionization (0.5 < O32 < 38.0), reddening (0.02 < E(B − V) < 0.67), and nebular density (10 < n e  (cm−3) < 1120). CLASSY is biased to UV-bright star-forming galaxies, resulting in a sample that is consistent with the z ∼ 0 mass-metallicity relationship, but is offset to higher star formation rates by roughly 2 dex, similar to z ≳ 2 galaxies. This unique set of properties makes the CLASSY atlas the benchmark training set for star-forming galaxies across cosmic time.",

It is primarily designed to address two key science questions, namely, \"what sources ionized the universe and when?\"and \"how do baryons cycle through galaxies?\", while also enabling a broad variety of first look scientific investigations. In primary mode, it will obtain NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy of galaxies lensed by the foreground Hubble Frontier Field cluster, Abell 2744. In parallel, it will use NIRCam to observe two fields that are offset from the cluster center, where lensing magnification is negligible, and which can thus be effectively considered blank fields. In order to prepare the community for access to this unprecedented data, we describe the scientific rationale, the survey design (including target selection and observational setups), and present pre-commissioning estimates of the expected sensitivity. In addition, we describe the planned public releases of high-level data products, for use by the wider astronomical community.",

        "abstract": "Strong nebular emission lines are an important diagnostic tool for tracing the evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time. However, different observational setups can affect these lines, and the derivation of the physical nebular properties. We analyze 12 local star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopy SurveY (CLASSY) to assess the impact of using different aperture combinations on the determination of the physical conditions and gas-phase metallicity. We compare optical spectra observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release aperture, which has a 3″ diameter similar to COS, IFU, and long-slit spectra, including new LBT/MODS observations of five CLASSY galaxies. We calculate the reddening, electron densities and temperatures, metallicities, star formation rates, and equivalent widths (EWs). We find that measurements of the electron densities and temperatures, and metallicity remained roughly constant with aperture size, indicating that the gas conditions are relatively uniform for this sample. However, using IFU observations of three galaxies, we find that the E(B - V) values derived from the Balmer ratios decrease (by up to 53%) with increasing aperture size. The values change most significantly in the center of the galaxies, and level out near the COS aperture diameter of 2.″5. We examine the relative contributions from the gas and stars using the Hα and [O iii] λ5007 EWs as a function of aperture light fraction, but find little to no variations within a given galaxy. These results imply that the optical spectra provide nebular properties appropriate for the far-UV CLASSY spectra, even when narrow 1.″0 long-slit observations are used.",

        "abstract": "We present spectroscopic confirmation of candidate strong gravitational lenses using the Keck Observatory and Very Large Telescope as part of our ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. We confirm that (1) search methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with visual inspection successfully identify strong gravitational lenses and (2) the lenses are at higher redshifts relative to existing surveys due to the combination of deeper and higher-resolution imaging from DECam and spectroscopy spanning optical to near-infrared wavelengths. We measure 104 redshifts in 77 systems selected from a catalog in the DES and DECaLS imaging fields (r ≤ 22 mag). Combining our results with published redshifts, we present redshifts for 68 lenses and establish that CNN-based searches are highly effective for use in future imaging surveys with a success rate of at least 88% (defined as 68/77). We report 53 strong lenses with spectroscopic redshifts for both the deflector and source (z src > z defl), and 15 lenses with a spectroscopic redshift for either the deflector (z defl > 0.21) or source (z src ≥ 1.34). For the 68 lenses, the deflectors and sources have average redshifts and standard deviations of 0.58 ± 0.14 and 1.92 ± 0.59 respectively, and corresponding redshift ranges of z defl = 0.21-0.89 and z src = 0.88-3.55. The AGEL systems include 41 deflectors at z defl ≥ 0.5 that are ideal for follow-up studies to track how mass density profiles evolve with redshift. Our goal with AGEL is to spectroscopically confirm ∼100 strong gravitational lenses that can be observed from both hemispheres throughout the year. The AGEL survey is a resource for refining automated all-sky searches and addressing a range of questions in astrophysics and cosmology.",

With ∼15 hr of preimaging and multiangle grism exposures in the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters, we describe the general data handling (i.e., reduction, cleaning, modeling, and extraction processes) and analysis for the GLASS-JWST survey. We showcase the power of JWST to peer deep into reionization, when most intergalactic hydrogen is neutral, by confirming two galaxies at z = 8.04 ± 0.15 and z = 7.90 ± 0.13 by means of their Lyman breaks. Fainter continuum spectra are observed in both the F150W and F200W bands, indicative of blue (−1.69 and −1.33) UV slopes and moderately bright absolute magnitudes (−20.37 and −19.68 mag). We do not detect strong Lyα in either galaxy, but do observe tentative (∼2.7-3.8σ) He ii λ1640 Å, O iii]λλ1661,1666 Å, and N iii]λλ1747,1749 Å line emission in one, suggestive of low-metallicity, star-forming systems with possible nonthermal contributions. These novel observations provide a first look at the extraordinary potential of JWST/NIRISS for confirming representative samples of bright z ≥ 7 sources in the absence of strong emission lines, and gain unprecedented insight into their contributions toward cosmic reionization.",

Moreover, the abundance of urine proteins obtained from these assays is not routinely validated with orthogonal methods (OMs). We report an in-depth comparison of SomaScan readout for 23 proteins in urine samples from patients with diabetic kidney disease (n = 118) vs OMs, including liquid chromatography-targeted mass spectrometry (LC-MS), ELISA, and nephelometry. Pearson correlation between urine abundance of the 23 proteins from SomaScan 3.2 vs OMs ranged from -0.58 to 0.86, with a median (interquartile ratio, [IQR]) of 0.49 (0.18, 0.53). In multivariable linear regression, the SomaScan readout for 6 of the 23 examined proteins (26%) was most strongly associated with the OM-derived abundance of the same (target) protein. For 3 of 23 (13%), the SomaScan and OM-derived abundance of each protein were significantly associated, but the SomaScan readout was more strongly associated with OM-derived abundance of one or more \"off-target\" proteins. For the remaining 14 proteins (61%), the SomaScan readouts were not significantly associated with the OM-derived abundance of the targeted proteins. In 6 of the latest group, the SomaScan readout was not associated with urine abundance of any of the 23 quantified proteins. To sum, over half of the SomaScan results could not be confirmed by independent orthogonal methods.",

In this paper we consider the well-known proportional hazard (PH) regression model for survival analysis. Ordinarily, the PH model is used with a few covariates and many observations (subjects). We consider here the case that the number of covariates, p, exceeds the number of samples, N, a setting typical of gene expression data from DNA microarrays. RESULTS: For a given vector of response values which are survival times and p gene expressions (covariates) we examine the problem of how to predict the survival probabilities, when N << p. The approach taken to cope with the high dimensionality is to reduce the dimension using partial least squares with the response variable as the vector of survival times. After dimension reduction, the extracted PLS gene components are then used as covariates in a PH regression to predict the survival probabilities. We demonstrate the use of the methodology on two cDNA gene expression data sets, both containing survival data. The first data set contains 40 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tissue samples and the second data set contains 49 tissue samples from patients with locally advanced breast cancer in a prospective study.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The effect of low doses of low-linear energy transfer (photon) ionizing radiation (LDIR, <10 cGy) on human tissue when exposure is under normal physiologic conditions is of significant interest to the medical and scientific community in therapeutic and other contexts. Although, to date, there has been no direct assessment of the response of human tissue to LDIR when exposure is under normal physiologic conditions of intact three-dimensional architecture, vasculature, and cell-cell contacts (between epithelial cells and between epithelial and stromal cells). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this article, we present the first data on the response of human tissue exposed in vivo to LDIR with precisely controlled and calibrated doses. We evaluated transcriptomic responses to a single exposure of LDIR in the normal skin of men undergoing therapeutic radiation for prostate cancer (research protocol, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, Institutional Review Board-approved). Using newly developed biostatistical tools that account for individual splice variants and the expected variability of temporal response between humans even when the outcome is measured at a single time, we show a dose-response pattern in gene expression in a number of pathways and gene groups that are biologically plausible responses to LDIR. RESULTS: Examining genes and pathways identified as radiation-responsive in cell culture models, we found seven gene groups and five pathways that were altered in men in this experiment. These included the Akt/phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway, the growth factor pathway, the stress/apoptosis pathway, and the pathway initiated by transforming growth factor-beta signaling, whereas gene groups with altered expression included the keratins, the zinc finger proteins and signaling molecules in the mitogen-activated protein kinase gene group. We show that there is considerable individual variability in radiation response that makes the detection of effects difficult, but still feasible when analyzed according to gene group and pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These results show for the first time that low doses of radiation have an identifiable biosignature in human tissue, irradiated in vivo with normal intact three-dimensional architecture, vascular supply, and innervation. The genes and pathways show that the tissue (a) does detect the injury, (b) initiates a stress/inflammatory response, (c) undergoes DNA remodeling, as suggested by the significant increase in zinc finger protein gene expression, and (d) initiates a \"pro-survival\" response. The ability to detect a distinct radiation response pattern following LDIR exposure has important implications for risk assessment in both therapeutic and national defense contexts.",

A major drawback to their use against pest species is their low level of persistence in many agricultural systems. While a number of studies have examined the persistence of these biological control agents over periods of days and/or weeks, the longer-term survival of these nematodes has received less attention. We report the results of a year-long field experiment testing the long-term survival of infective juveniles (IJs) of the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis marelatus (Liu and Berry), under a range of initial densities. We buried mesh-covered tubes containing raw field soil with varying densities of H. marelatus IJs in a coastal prairie containing naturally occurring populations of this nematode and then destructively sampled subsets of the tubes for nematode presence five times over 1 yr. H. marelatus IJs lived a surprisingly long time in the absence of prey: some nematodes from the initial cohort were viable after a year in the field. Survival over the year-long course of the experiment was independent of the starting IJ density, suggesting that H. marelatus does not aggregate at high densities to reduce desiccation risk. Our results highlight the fact that IJs vary greatly in their long-term survival; selecting entomopathogenic nematode isolates for persistence as well as virulence could enhance this biological control agent's long-term effectiveness in agricultural systems. © 2005 Entomological Society of America.",

        "abstract": "We compared resistance to insect herbivory in two introduced populations of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) differing in their history of herbivory. One population in Willapa Bay, Washington, has spread in the absence of herbivory for more than a century, while another population in San Francisco, California, was introduced 20 years ago and is fed upon by the Spartina-specialist planthopper, Prokelisia marginata. The planthopper is a sap-feeder common on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America, where smooth cordgrass is native. Smooth cordgrass plants from Willapa Bay (WB), San Francisco Bay (SFB), and Maryland (the source of the SFB introduction) were exposed to P. marginata herbivory over two consecutive summers in a common greenhouse environment, and their growth was compared with that of control plants that were grown herbivore-free. The planthoppers had relatively little effect on the growth of SFB plants, with plants exposed to herbivores averaging 77% and 83% of the aboveground biomass of herbivore-free controls after the first and second season of herbivory, respectively. The growth of plants from Maryland was similarly little-affected by the planthoppers, with the plants exposed to herbivores averaging near 100% of the biomass of herbivore-free controls after two seasons. In contrast, the growth of the WB plants was greatly reduced by the planthopper, with the plants exposed to planthopper herbivory averaging only 30% and 12% of the aboveground biomass of herbivore-free controls after the first and second seasons of herbivory, respectively. By the end of the second season of herbivory, 37% of the WB plants exposed to herbivory had died, while none of the SFB plants exposed to herbivores had died. Among WB clones, there was variation in resistance; one WB clone suffered 0% mortality while another suffered 100% mortality when exposed to herbivores. Short-term herbivory experiments with the putative founder clone for the WB population suggested that the WB founder was similar to the more resistant WB clones in its susceptibility to planthopper herbivory. Nitrogen analyses of green leaf tissue indicated that WB plants, including the WB founder clone, averaged 70% more total leaf nitrogen than SFB and Maryland plants. In a planthopper choice experiment, more planthoppers were observed on WB plants than SFB plants after 95 days of exposure to herbivory. Planthopper preference for WB plants may have contributed to the lower resistance of WB plants to herbivory; however, even before planthoppers had become more abundant on the WB plants, the proportion of leaves with 50% or more dead tissue averaged significantly greater on the WB plants, suggesting a difference between populations in tolerance to herbivory as well. Multiple factors, including a founder effect, further loss of herbivore tolerance, and herbivore preference for WB plants, appear to account for the reduced planthopper resistance in the WB population.",

        "abstract": "Four species of exotic cordgrass (Spartina sp.) occur in the San Francisco estuary in addition to the California native Spartina foliosa. Our goal was to map the location and extent of all non-native Spartina in the estuary. Hybrids of S. alterniflora and S. foliosa are by far the most numerous exotic and are spreading rapidly. Radiating from sites of deliberate introduction, S. alterniflora and hybrids now cover ca. 190 ha, mainly in the South and Central Bay. Estimates of rate of aerial increase range from a constant value to an accelerating rate of increase. This could be due to the proliferation of hybrid clones capable of rapid expansion and having superior seed set and siring abilities. The total coverage of 195 ha by hybrids and other exotic cordgrass species is slightly less than 1% of the Bay's tidal mudflats and marshes. Spartina anglica has not spread beyond its original 1970s introduction site. Spartina densiflora has spread to cover over 5 ha at 3 sites in the Central Bay. Spartina patens has expanded from 2 plants in 1970 to 42 plants at one site in Suisun Bay. Spartina seed floats on the tide, giving it the potential to export this invasion throughout the San Francisco estuary, and to estuaries outside of the Golden Gate. We found isolated plants of S. alterniflora and S. densiflora in outer coast estuaries north of the Bay suggesting the likelihood for the San Francisco Bay populations to found others on the Pacific coast.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling is crucial for the maintenance and function of various myeloid subsets. CSF1R antagonism was previously shown to mitigate clinical severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The associated mechanisms are still not well delineated. METHODS: To assess the effect of CSF1R signaling, we employed the CSF1R antagonist PLX5622 formulated in chow (PLX5622 diet, PD) and its control chow (control diet, CD). We examined the effect of PD in steady state and EAE by analyzing cells isolated from peripheral immune organs and from the CNS via flow cytometry. We determined CNS infiltration sites and assessed the extent of demyelination using immunohistochemistry of cerebella and spinal cords. Transcripts of genes associated with neuroinflammation were also analyzed in these tissues. RESULTS: In addition to microglial depletion, PD treatment reduced dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral immune organs, both during steady state and during EAE. Furthermore, CSF1R antagonism modulated numbers and relative frequencies of T effector cells both in the periphery and in the CNS during the early stages of the disease. Classical neurological symptoms were milder in PD compared to CD mice. Interestingly, a subset of PD mice developed atypical EAE symptoms. Unlike previous studies, we observed that the CNS of PD mice was infiltrated by increased numbers of peripheral immune cells compared to that of CD mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CNS infiltrates in PD mice were mainly localized in the cerebellum while in CD mice infiltrates were primarily localized in the spinal cords during the onset of neurological deficits. Accordingly, during the same timepoint, cerebella of PD but not of CD mice had extensive demyelinating lesions, while spinal cords of CD but not of PD mice were heavily demyelinated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CSF1R activity modulates the cellular composition of immune cells both in the periphery and within the CNS, and affects lesion localization during the early EAE stages.",

        "abstract": "Ischemic stroke occurs as a result of blood supply interruption to the brain causing tissue degeneration, patient disabilities or death. Currently, treatment of ischemic stroke is limited to thrombolytic therapy with a narrow time window of administration. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway has a fundamental role in the central nervous system development, but its impact on neural cell survival and tissue regeneration/repair after ischemic stroke has not been well investigated. Here we report the neuroprotective properties of a small-molecule agonist of the Shh co-receptor Smoothened, purmorphamine (PUR), in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemic stroke. We found that intravenous administration of PUR at 6 h after injury was neuroprotective and restored neurological deficit after stroke. PUR promoted a transient upregulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator in injured neurons, which was associated with a reduction of apoptotic cell death in the ischemic cortex. We also observed a decrease in blood-brain barrier permeability after PUR treatment. At 14 d postinjury, attenuation of inflammation and reactive astrogliosis was found in PUR-treated animals. PUR increased the number of newly generated neurons in the peri-infarct and infarct area and promoted neovascularization in the ischemic zone. Notably, PUR treatment did not significantly alter the ischemia-induced level of Gli1, a Shh target gene of tumorigenic potential. Thus our study reports a novel pharmacological approach for postischemic treatment using a small-molecule Shh agonist, providing new insights into hedgehog signaling-mediated mechanisms of neuroprotection and regeneration after stroke.",

        "abstract": "Non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling plays a primary role in the convergent extension that drives neural tube closure and body axis elongation. PCP signaling gene mutations cause severe neural tube defects (NTDs). However, the role of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in neural tube closure and NTDs remains poorly understood. This study shows that conditional gene targeting of β-catenin in the dorsal neural folds of mouse embryos represses the expression of the homeobox-containing genes Pax3 and Cdx2 at the dorsal posterior neuropore (PNP), and subsequently diminishes the expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling target genes T, Tbx6 and Fgf8 at the tail bud, leading to spina bifida aperta, caudal axis bending and tail truncation. We demonstrate that Pax3 and Cdx2 are novel downstream targets of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Transgenic activation of Pax3 cDNA can rescue the closure defect in the β-catenin mutants, suggesting that Pax3 is a key downstream effector of β-catenin signaling in the PNP closure process. Cdx2 is known to be crucial in posterior axis elongation and in neural tube closure. We found that Cdx2 expression is also repressed in the dorsal PNPs of Pax3-null embryos. However, the ectopically activated Pax3 in the β-catenin mutants cannot restore Cdx2 mRNA in the dorsal PNP, suggesting that the presence of both β-catenin and Pax3 is required for regional Cdx2 expression. Thus, β-catenin signaling is required for caudal neural tube closure and elongation, acting through the transcriptional regulation of key target genes in the PNP.",

        "abstract": "In this perspective, we discuss new evidence relating to current dietary recommendations to reduce SFA intake to modulate an individual's global risk of CVD. Although it is well established that lowering dietary SFA intake has a beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol concentrations, findings increasingly indicate an opposite effect on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. In recent years, many studies have firmly established a role for an elevated Lp(a) concentration as a genetically regulated, causal, and prevalent risk factor for CVD. However, there is less awareness of the effect of dietary SFA intake on Lp(a) concentrations. This study discusses this issue and highlights the contrasting effect of reducing dietary SFA intake on LDL cholesterol and Lp(a), 2 highly atherogenic lipoproteins. This calls attention to the need for precision nutrition approaches that move beyond a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. To illustrate the contrast, we describe the dynamic contributions of Lp(a) and LDL cholesterol concentrations to CVD risk during interventions with a low-SFA diet, with the hope that this will stimulate further studies and discussions regarding dietary management of CVD risk.",

        "issued": "2024",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence is increasing and correlated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; formerly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), even in patients without advanced liver fibrosis who are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced disease stages and shorter survival time, and less likely to receive a liver transplant. Machine learning (ML) tools can characterize large datasets and help develop predictive models that can calculate individual HCC risk and guide selective screening and risk mitigation strategies. METHODS: Tableau and KNIME Analytics were used for descriptive analytics and ML tasks. ML models were developed using standard laboratory and clinical parameters. Sci-kit learn algorithms were used for model development. Data from University of California (UC), Davis, were used to develop and train a pilot predictive model, which was subsequently validated in an independent dataset from UC San Francisco. MASLD and HCC patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases-9/10 codes. RESULTS: Of the patients diagnosed with MASLD (n = 1561 training; n = 686 validation), HCC developed in 14% (n = 227) of the UC Davis training cohort and 25% (n = 176) of the UC San Francisco validation cohort. Liver fibrosis determined by the noninvasive Fibrosis-4 score was the strongest single predictor for HCC in the model. Using the validation cohort, the model predicted HCC development at 92.06% accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.97, F1-score of 0.84, 98.34% specificity, and 74.41% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: ML models can aid physicians in providing early HCC risk assessment in patients with MASLD. Further validation will translate to cost-effective, personalized care of at-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "There has been enormous interest in the biologic activity of mushrooms and innumerable claims have been made that mushrooms have beneficial effects on immune function with subsequent implications for inhibition of tumor growth. The majority of these observations are anecdotal and often lack standardization. However, there remains considerable data on both in vitro and in vivo effects that reflect on the potential of mushroom compounds to influence human immunity. A number of these effects are beneficial but, unfortunately, many responses are still characterized based on phenomenology and there is more speculation than substance. With respect to tumor biology, although many neoplastic lesions are immunogenic, tumor antigens frequently are self antigens and induce tolerance and many patients with cancer exhibit suppressed immune responses, including defective antigen presentation. Therefore, if and when mushroom extracts are effective, they more likely function as a result of improved antigen presentation by dendritic cells than by a direct cytopathic effect. In this review we attempt to place these data in perspective, with a particular focus on dendritic cell populations and the ability of mushroom extracts to modulate immunity. There is, at present, no scientific basis for the use of either mushrooms or mushroom extracts in the treatment of human patients but there is significant potential for rigorous research to understand the potential of mushrooms in human disease and thence to focus on appropriate clinical trials to demonstrate effectiveness and/ or potential toxicity.",

The blood flow measurements appear to predict the amount of parenchymal reduction achieved by embolization and show promise as a method of monitoring these procedures.",

For topological patterns in fully-discrete one-dimensional systems, future equivalence uniquely specifies a minimal semiautomaton. We demonstrate how the latter and its semigroup algebra generalizes translation symmetry to partial and hidden symmetries. This generalization is not as straightforward as previously considered. Here, though, we clarify the underlying challenges. A stochastic form of future equivalence, known as predictive equivalence, captures distinct statistical patterns supported on topological patterns. Finally, we show how local versions of future equivalence can be used to capture patterns in spacetime. As common when moving to higher dimensions, there is not a unique local approach, and we detail two local representations that capture different aspects of spacetime patterns. A previously developed local spacetime variant of future equivalence captures patterns as generalized symmetries in higher dimensions, but we show that this representation is not a faithful generator of its spacetime patterns. This motivates us to introduce a local representation that is a faithful generator, but we demonstrate that it no longer captures generalized spacetime symmetries. Taken altogether, building on future equivalence, the theory defines and quantifies patterns present in a wide range of classical field theories.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive systems—such as a biological organism gaining survival advantage, an autonomous robot executing a functional task, or a motor protein transporting intracellular nutrients—must somehow embody relevant regularities and stochasticity in their environments to take full advantage of thermodynamic resources. Analogously, but in a purely computational realm, machine learning algorithms estimate models to capture predictable structure and identify irrelevant noise in training data. This happens through optimization of performance metrics, such as model likelihood. If such learning is physically implemented, is there a sense in which computational models estimated through machine learning are physically preferred? We introduce the thermodynamic principle that work production is the most relevant performance measure for an adaptive physical agent and compare the results to the maximum-likelihood principle that guides machine learning. Within the class of physical agents that most efficiently harvest energy from their environment, we demonstrate that an efficient agent’s model explicitly determines its architecture and how much useful work it harvests from the environment. We then show that selecting the maximum-work agent for given environmental data corresponds to finding the maximum-likelihood model. This establishes an equivalence between nonequilibrium thermodynamics and dynamic learning. In this way, work maximization emerges as an organizing principle that underlies learning in adaptive thermodynamic systems.",

        "abstract": "We compare and contrast three different, but complementary views of \"structure\" and \"pattern\" in spatial processes. For definiteness and analytical clarity, we apply all three approaches to the simplest class of spatial processes: one-dimensional Ising spin systems with finite-range interactions. These noncritical systems are well-suited for this study since the change in structure as a function of system parameters is more subtle than that found in critical systems where, at a phase transition, many observables diverge, thereby making the detection of change in structure obvious. This survey demonstrates that the measures of pattern from information theory and computational mechanics differ from known thermodynamic and statistical mechanical functions. Moreover, they capture important structural features that are otherwise missed. In particular, a type of mutual information called the excess entropy-an information theoretic measure of memory-serves to detect ordered, low entropy density patterns. It is superior in several respects to other functions used to probe structure, such as magnetization and structure factors. ϵ-Machines-the main objects of computational mechanics-are seen to be the most direct approach to revealing the (group and semigroup) symmetries possessed by the spatial patterns and to estimating the minimum amount of memory required to reproduce the configuration ensemble, a quantity known as the statistical complexity. Finally, we argue that the information theoretic and computational mechanical analyses of spatial patterns capture the intrinsic computational capabilities embedded in spin systems-how they store, transmit, and manipulate configurational information to produce spatial structure.",

As a consequence, the proper setting for empirical modeling is that of partially-observed systems. Notably, data-driven models consistently outperform physics-based models for systems with few observable degrees of freedom; e.g. hydrological systems. Here, we provide an operator-theoretic explanation for this empirical success. To predict a partially-observed system’s future behavior with physics-based models, the missing degrees of freedom must be explicitly accounted for using data assimilation and model parametrization. Data-driven models, in contrast, employ delay-coordinate embeddings and their evolution under the Koopman operator to implicitly model the effects of the missing degrees of freedom. We describe in detail the statistical physics of partial observations underlying data-driven models using novel maximum entropy and maximum caliber measures. The resulting nonequilibrium Wiener projections applied to the Mori-Zwanzig formalism reveal how data-driven models may converge to the true dynamics of the observable degrees of freedom. Additionally, this framework shows how data-driven models infer the effects of unobserved degrees of freedom implicitly, in much the same way that physics models infer the effects explicitly. This provides a unified implicit-explicit modeling framework for predicting partially-observed systems, with hybrid physics-informed machine learning methods combining both implicit and explicit aspects.",

We then take up the neurobiological examples of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels to apply and illustrate the theory, elucidating their nonequilibrium behavior under a biophysically plausible action potential drive.

The starting point for this method is to truncate the interacting Hamiltonian to a finite-dimensional space of states spanned by the eigenvectors of the free Hamiltonian H0 with eigenvalues below some energy cutoff Emax. In this work, we show how to treat Hamiltonian truncation systematically using effective field theory methodology. We define the finite-dimensional effective Hamiltonian by integrating out the states above Emax. The effective Hamiltonian can be computed by matching a transition amplitude to the full theory, and gives corrections order by order as an expansion in powers of 1/Emax. The effective Hamiltonian is non-local, with the non-locality controlled in an expansion in powers of H0/Emax. The effective Hamiltonian is also non-Hermitian, and we discuss whether this is a necessary feature or an artifact of our definition. We apply our formalism to 2D λφ4 theory, and compute the the leading 1/Emax2 corrections to the effective Hamiltonian. We show that these corrections non-trivially satisfy the crucial property of separation of scales. Numerical diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian gives residual errors of order 1/Emax3 , as expected by our power counting. We also present the power counting for 3D λφ4 theory and perform calculations that demonstrate the separation of scales in this theory.",

The effective lagrangian for the associated Goldstone field can be uniquely determined by the non-linear realization of a broken time diffeomorphism symmetry, up to some overall mass scales. It has previously been shown that this symmetry breaking pattern gives rise to a Higgs phase of gravity, in which gravity is modified in the infrared. In this paper, we study the effects of direct couplings between the Goldstone boson and standard model fermions, which necessarily accompany Lorentz-violating terms in the theory. The leading interaction is the coupling to the axial vector current, which reduces to spin in the non-relativistic limit. A spin moving relative to the ''ether\" rest frame will emit Goldstone Cerenkov radiation. The Goldstone also induces a long-range inverse-square law force between spin sources with a striking angular dependence, reflecting the underlying Goldstone shockwaves and providing a smoking gun for this theory. We discuss the regime of validity of the effective theory describing these phenomena, and the possibility of probing Lorentz violations through Goldstone boson signals in a way that is complementary to direct tests in some regions of parameter space. © SISSA 2005.",

The observed relic abundance fixes the strength of the cubic coupling, so the parameters of the models are defined by the masses of the WIMP and lepton partner particles. This gives a simple parameter space where collider and direct detection experiments can be compared under well-defined physical minimality assumptions. The most sensitive collider probe is the search for leptons+MET, while the most sensitive direct detection channel is scattering from nuclei arising from loop diagrams.

We study minimal models with such couplings that explain dark matter as a thermal relic.

The dark matter has spin 0, 12, or 1, and may or may not be its own antiparticle. Each model has 3 parameters: the masses of the dark matter and standard model partners, and the cubic coupling.

We focus on the case of dark matter interactions with colored particles. We find that collider and direct detection searches are remarkably complementary for these models. Direct detection limits for the cases where the dark matter is not its own antiparticle require dark matter masses to be in the multi-TeV range, where they are extremely difficult to probe in collider experiments. The models where dark matter is its own antiparticle are strongly constrained by collider searches for monojet and jets+MET signals. These models are constrained by direct detection mainly near the limit where the dark matter and partner masses are nearly degenerate, where collider searches become more difficult. © 2014 American Physical Society.",

Both ATLAS and CMS have already presented some results in terms of simplified models, and we encourage them to continue and expand this effort, which supplements both signature-based results and benchmark model interpretations. A simplified model is defined by an effective Lagrangian describing the interactions of a small number of new particles. Simplified models can equally well be described by a small number of masses and cross-sections. These parameters are directly related to collider physics observables, making simplified models a particularly effective framework for evaluating searches and a useful starting point for characterizing positive signals of new physics. This document serves as an official summary of the results from the Topologies for Early LHC Searches workshop, held at SLAC in September of 2010, the purpose of which was to develop a set of representative models that can be used to cover all relevant phase space in experimental searches. Particular emphasis is placed on searches relevant for the first 50-500 pb1 of data and those motivated by supersymmetric models. This note largely summarizes material posted at http://lhcnewphysics.org/, which includes simplified model definitions, Monte Carlo material, and supporting contacts within the theory community. We also comment on future developments that may be useful as more data is gathered and analyzed by the experiments. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Results indicated the presence of 13 major elements in the Artemisia species with varied concentrations including Carbon (45.7%, 45,7000 ppm-49.8%, 49,8000 ppm), Nitrogen (2.03%, 20,300 ppm-3.50%, 35,000 ppm), Phosphorus (0.168%, 1680 ppm-0.642%, 6420 ppm), Potassium (2.38%, 23,800 ppm-4.72%, 47,200 ppm), Sulphur (1920 ppm, 0.192%-4780 ppm, 0.478%), Boron (23.8 ppm, 0.00238%-71.7 ppm, 0.00717%), Calcium (0.733%, 7330 ppm-2.249%, 22,490 ppm), Magnesium (0.116%, 1160 ppm-0.267%, 2670 ppm), Zinc (27.7 ppm, 0.00277%-47.9 ppm, 0.00479%), Manganese (25.7 ppm, 0.00257%-93.8 ppm, 0.00938%), Iron (353 ppm, 0.0353%-1532 ppm, 0.1532%), Copper (14.1 ppm, 0.00141%-26.2 ppm, 0.00262%) and Sodium (105 ppm, 0.0105%-587 ppm, 0.0587%). Cluster analysis distributed the Artemisia species into two major groups (G1 and G2) on the basis of their elemental content where G1 contained species like, Artemisia herba alba Asso., A. tournefortiana Rachb., A. rutifolia Steph. ex Spreng., and A. vulgaris L., with the presence of all elements with the maximum amount of S, Zn, P, Ca, and Mg, while G2 contained species like Artemisia biennis Willd., A. chamaemelifolia Vill., A. capillaris, L., A. gmelinii Weber ex Stech., A. indica Willd., A. maritima L., and A. verlotiorum Lamotte., with all elements but significant concentrations of B, N, C, K, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Na. PCA analysis displayed maximum species diversity in the axes two, while axes one showed lower diversity. Additionally, the elevated levels of elements recorded as compared to the threshold levels recommended in the literature for medicinal plants require extraordinary precautionary measures before or during using Artemisia as medication to avoid metal toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Prunus is an economically important genus widely distributed in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Previous studies on the genus using a variety of loci yielded conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses. Here, we generated nuclear reduced representation sequencing data and plastid genomes for 36 Prunus individuals and two outgroups. Both nuclear and plastome data recovered a well-resolved phylogeny. The species were divided into three main clades corresponding to their inflorescence types, - the racemose group, the solitary-flower group and the corymbose group - with the latter two sister to one another. Prunus was inferred to have diversified initially in the Late Cretaceous around 67.32 million years ago. The diversification of the three major clades began between the Paleocene and Miocene, suggesting that paleoclimatic events were an important driving force for Prunus diversification. Ancestral state reconstructions revealed that the most recent common ancestor of Prunus had racemose inflorescences, and the solitary-flower and corymb inflorescence types were derived by reduction of flower number and suppression of the rachis, respectively. We also tested the hybrid origin hypothesis of the racemose group proposed in previous studies. Prunus has undergone extensive hybridization events, although it is difficult to identify conclusively specific instances of hybridization when using SNP data, especially deep in the phylogeny. Our study provides well-resolved nuclear and plastid phylogenies of Prunus, reveals substantial cytonuclear discord at shallow scales, and sheds new light on inflorescence evolution in this economically important lineage.",

        "abstract": "Synsepalum and Englerophytum are two closely related genera of the sub-family Chrysophylloideae in the family Sapotaceae. It has been reported that the two genera are a monophyletic group, and their generic limitations are uncertain. Synsepalum is an economically important genus that includes the medicinally and culinarily important plant, -miracle berry, S. dulcificum. The phylogenetic relationships among the species are poorly understood. This study has been conducted to refine the phylogenetic relationships between and within the two genera utilizing nuclear and chloroplast DNA data. Bayesian analyses and Maximum likelihood of nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid (trnH-psbA) sequences were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of the two genera. Phylogenetic trees generated for both regions (nuclear and plastid) resulted in the resolution of six clades. Four of the clades correspond to species in the genus Synsepalum and two clades include species of Englerophytum. The two clades of Englerophytum are nested within Synsepalum suggesting that the two genera are closely related and may not merit their current circumscription as distinct genera. Also, Synsepalum is confirmed to constitute more than one lineage suggesting it is not monophyletic in its current definition. Overall, the study suggests the need for a comprehensive evaluation of all species currently recognized in the two genera.",

The loci amplified were polymorphic in samples collected from Jamaica and Panama. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 10 and three to 12, while observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.074 to 0.704 and 0.407 to 0.852 in Jamaica and Panama, respectively. • CONCLUSIONS: The microsatellite primers will be useful in future population genetic studies as well as those aimed at understanding the geographic origin(s) of wild and cultivated populations.",

        "abstract": "Reconstructing the phylogeny of Pyrus has been difficult due to the wide distribution of the genus and lack of informative data. In this study, we collected 110 accessions representing 25 Pyrus species and constructed both phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic networks based on multiple DNA sequence datasets. Phylogenetic trees based on both cpDNA and nuclear LFY2int2-N (LN) data resulted in poor resolution, especially, only five primary species were monophyletic in the LN tree. A phylogenetic network of LN suggested that reticulation caused by hybridization is one of the major evolutionary processes for Pyrus species. Polytomies of the gene trees and star-like structure of cpDNA networks suggested rapid radiation is another major evolutionary process, especially for the occidental species. Pyrus calleryana and P. regelii were the earliest diverged Pyrus species. Two North African species, P. cordata, P. spinosa and P. betulaefolia were descendent of primitive stock Pyrus species and still share some common molecular characters. Southwestern China, where a large number of P. pashia populations are found, is probably the most important diversification center of Pyrus. More accessions and nuclear genes are needed for further understanding the evolutionary histories of Pyrus.",

These distant galaxies are well resolved due to the gravitational lensing power of foreground galaxy clusters, imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. We compute sizes using the forward-modelling code lenstruction and account for magnification using public lens models. The resulting size-magnitude measurements confirm the existence of many small galaxies with effective radii Reff < 200 pc in the early Universe, in agreement with previous studies. In addition, we highlight compact and highly star-forming sources with star formation rate surface densities Σ SFR>10M· yr-1, kpc-2 as possible Lyman continuum leaking candidates that could be major contributors to the process of reionization. Future spectroscopic follow-up of these compact galaxies (e.g. with the James Webb Space Telescope) will further clarify their role in reionization and the physics of early star formation.",

        "abstract": "Using data from JWST, we analyse the compact sources (\"sparkles\") located around a remarkable z spec = 1.378 galaxy (the 'Sparkler) that is strongly gravitationally lensed by the z = 0.39 galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. Several of these compact sources can be cross-identified in multiple images, making it clear that they are associated with the host galaxy. Combining data from JWSTs Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) with archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we perform 0.4-4.4 μm photometry on these objects, finding several of them to be very red and consistent with the colors of quenched, old stellar systems. Morphological fits confirm that these red sources are spatially unresolved even in the strongly magnified JWST/NIRCam images, while the JWST/NIRISS spectra show [Oiii] λ5007 emission in the body of the Sparkler but no indication of star formation in the red compact sparkles. The most natural interpretation of these compact red companions to the Sparkler is that they are evolved globular clusters seen at z = 1.378. Applying Dense Basis spectral energy distribution fitting to the sample, we infer formation redshifts of z form ∼7-11 for these globular cluster candidates, corresponding to ages of 1/43.9-4.1 Gyr at the epoch of observation and a formation time just 1/40.5 Gyr after the Big Bang. If confirmed with additional spectroscopy, these red, compact sparkles represent the first evolved globular clusters found at high redshift, which could be among the earliest observed objects to have quenched their star formation in the universe, and may open a new window into understanding globular cluster formation. Data and code to reproduce our results will be made available at http://canucs-jwst.com/sparkler.html.",

We obtain a multiband catalog by means of forced aperture photometry on point-spread function (PSF)-matched images at the position of F444W-detected sources. The catalog is intended to enable early scientific investigations, and it is optimized for faint galaxies; it contains 6368 sources, with limiting magnitude 29.7 at 5σ in F444W. We release both images and catalog in order to allow the community to become familiar with the JWST NIRCam data and evaluate their merit and limitations given the current level of knowledge of the instrument.",

The star’s background host galaxy lies on a fold caustic of the foreground lens, and the cluster creates a pair of images of the region close to the lensed star. We identified the bright transient in one of the merging images at a distance of ∼0.″15 from the critical curve by subtracting the JWST F115W and F150W imaging from coadditions of archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F105W and F125W images and F140W and F160W images, respectively. Since the time delay between the two images should be only hours, the transient must be the microlensing event of an individual star, as opposed to a luminous stellar explosion that would persist for days to months. Analysis of individual exposures suggests that the star’s magnification is not changing rapidly during the observations. From photometry of the point source through the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters, we identify a strong Balmer break, and modeling allows us to constrain the star’s temperature to be approximately 7000-12,000 K.",

        "abstract": "We present the serendipitous discovery of a late T-type brown dwarf candidate in JWST NIRCam observations of the Early Release Science Abell 2744 parallel field. The discovery was enabled by the sensitivity of JWST at 4 μm wavelengths and the panchromatic 0.9-4.5 μm coverage of the spectral energy distribution. The unresolved point source has magnitudes F115W = 27.95 ± 0.15 and F444W = 25.84 ± 0.01 (AB), and its F115W−F444W and F356W−F444W colors match those expected for other known T dwarfs. We can exclude it as a reddened background star, high redshift quasar, or a very high redshift galaxy. Comparison with stellar atmospheric models indicates a temperature of T eff ≈ 650 K and surface gravity log g ≈ 5.25 , implying a mass of 0.03 M ⊙ and age of 5 Gyr. We estimate the distance of this candidate to be 570-720 pc in a direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane, making it a likely thick disk or halo brown dwarf. These observations underscore the power of JWST to probe the very low-mass end of the substellar mass function in the Galactic thick disk and halo.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients presenting with acute abdominal pain that occurs after months or years following bariatric surgery may present for assessment and management in the local emergency units. Due to the large variety of surgical bariatric techniques, emergency surgeons have to be aware of the main functional outcomes and long-term surgical complications following the most performed bariatric surgical procedures. The purpose of these evidence-based guidelines is to present a consensus position from members of the WSES in collaboration with IFSO bariatric experienced surgeons, on the management of acute abdomen after bariatric surgery focusing on long-term complications in patients who have undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHOD: A working group of experienced general, acute care, and bariatric surgeons was created to carry out a systematic review of the literature following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and to answer the PICO questions formulated after the Operative management in bariatric acute abdomen survey. The literature search was limited to late/long-term complications following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS: The acute abdomen after bariatric surgery is a common cause of admission in emergency departments. Knowledge of the most common late/long-term complications (&gt; 4 weeks after surgical procedure) following sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and their anatomy leads to a focused management in the emergency setting with good outcomes and decreased morbidity and mortality rates. A close collaboration between emergency surgeons, radiologists, endoscopists, and anesthesiologists is mandatory in the management of this group of patients in the emergency setting.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-traumatic emergency general surgery involves a heterogeneous population that may present with several underlying diseases. Timeous emergency surgical treatment should be supplemented with high-quality perioperative care, ideally performed by multidisciplinary teams trained to identify and handle complex postoperative courses. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled acute postoperative pain may result in significant complications. While pain management after elective surgery has been standardized in perioperative pathways, the traditional perioperative treatment of patients undergoing emergency surgery is often a haphazard practice. The present recommended pain management guidelines are for pain management after non-traumatic emergency surgical intervention. It is meant to provide clinicians a list of indications to prescribe the optimal analgesics even in the absence of a multidisciplinary pain team. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An international expert panel discussed the different issues in subsequent rounds. Four international recognized scientific societies: World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), Global Alliance for Infection in Surgery (GAIS), Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia Intensive Care (SIAARTI), and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), endorsed the project and approved the final manuscript. CONCLUSION: Dealing with acute postoperative pain in the emergency abdominal surgery setting is complex, requires special attention, and should be multidisciplinary. Several tools are available, and their combination is mandatory whenever is possible. Analgesic approach to the various situations and conditions should be patient based and tailored according to procedure, pathology, age, response, and available expertise. A better understanding of the patho-mechanisms of postoperative pain for short- and long-term outcomes is necessary to improve prophylactic and treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a group of diseases characterized by an interruption of the blood supply to varying portions of the intestine, leading to ischemia and secondary inflammatory changes. If untreated, this process may progress to life-threatening intestinal necrosis. The incidence is low, estimated at 0.09-0.2% of all acute surgical admissions, but increases with age. Although the entity is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain, diligence is required because if untreated, mortality remains in the range of 50%. Early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are the cornerstones of modern treatment to reduce the high mortality associated with this entity. The advent of endovascular approaches in parallel with modern imaging techniques is evolving and provides new treatment options. Lastly, a focused multidisciplinary approach based on early diagnosis and individualized treatment is essential. Thus, we believe that updated guidelines from World Society of Emergency Surgery are warranted, in order to provide the most recent and practical recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of AMI.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retained rectal foreign bodies are a common but incompletely studied problem. This study defined the epidemiology, injury severity, and outcomes after rectal injuries following foreign body insertion. METHODS: Twenty-two level I trauma centers retrospectively identified all patients sustaining a rectal injury in this AAST multi-institutional trial (2005-2014). Only patients injured by foreign body insertion were included in this secondary analysis. Exclusion criteria were death before rectal injury management or ≤48 h of admission. Demographics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. Study groups were defined as partial thickness (AAST grade I) versus full thickness (AAST grades II-V) injuries. Subgroup analysis was performed by management strategy (nonoperative versus operative). RESULTS: After exclusions, 33 patients were identified. Mean age was 41 y (range 18-57), and 85% (n = 28) were male. Eleven (33%) had full thickness injuries and 22 (67%) had partial thickness injuries, of which 14 (64%) were managed nonoperatively and 8 (36%) operatively (proximal diversion alone [n = 3, 14%]; direct repair with proximal diversion [n = 2, 9%]; laparotomy without rectal intervention [n = 2, 9%]; and direct repair alone [n = 1, 5%]). Subgroup analysis of outcomes after partial thickness injury demonstrated significantly shorter hospital length of stay (2 ± 1; 2 [1-5] versus 5 ± 2; 4 [2-8] d, P = 0.0001) after nonoperative versus operative management. CONCLUSIONS: Although partial thickness rectal injuries do not require intervention, difficulty excluding full thickness injuries led some surgeons in this series to manage partial thickness injuries operatively. This was associated with significantly longer hospital length of stay. Therefore, we recommend nonoperative management after a retained rectal foreign body unless full thickness injury is conclusively identified.",

        "abstract": "Management of patients suffering from low back pain (LBP) is challenging and requires development of diagnostic techniques to identify specific patient subgroups and phenotypes in order to customize treatment and predict clinical outcome. The Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program Spine Imaging Working Group has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for spinal imaging protocols to be used in all BACPAC studies. These SOPs include procedures to conduct spinal imaging assessments with guidelines for standardizing the collection, reading/grading (using structured reporting with semi-quantitative evaluation using ordinal rating scales), and storage of images. This article presents the approach to image acquisition and evaluation recommended by the BACPAC Spine Imaging Working Group. While the approach is specific to BACPAC studies, it is general enough to be applied at other centers performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions in patients with LBP. The herein presented SOPs are meant to improve understanding of pain mechanisms and facilitate patient phenotyping by codifying MRI-based methods that provide standardized, non-invasive assessments of spinal pathologies. Finally, these recommended procedures may facilitate the integration of better harmonized MRI data of the lumbar spine across studies and sites within and outside of BACPAC studies.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the predictive role of baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT (bPET/CT) radiomics from two distinct target lesions in patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL). cHL patients examined with bPET/CT and interim PET/CT between 2010 and 2019 were retrospectively included. Two bPET/CT target lesions were selected for radiomic feature extraction: Lesion_A, with the largest axial diameter, and Lesion_B, with the highest SUVmax. Deauville score at interim PET/CT (DS) and 24-month progression-free-survival (PFS) were recorded. Mann-Whitney test identified the most promising image features (p < 0.05) from both lesions with regards to DS and PFS; all possible radiomic bivariate models were then built through a logistic regression analysis and trained/tested with a cross-fold validation test. The best bivariate models were selected based on their mean area under curve (mAUC). A total of 227 cHL patients were included. The best models for DS prediction had 0.78 ± 0.05 maximum mAUC, with a predominant contribution of Lesion_A features to the combinations. The best models for 24-month PFS prediction reached 0.74 ± 0.12 mAUC and mainly depended on Lesion_B features. bFDG-PET/CT radiomic features from the largest and hottest lesions in patients with cHL may provide relevant information in terms of early response-to-treatment and prognosis, thus representing an earlier and stronger decision-making support for therapeutic strategies. External validations of the proposed model are planned.",

Ampullary cancers are rare gastrointestinal malignancies, and prognosis varies greatly based on factors such as patient age, TNM classification, differentiation grade, and treatment modality received. Systemic therapy is used in all stages of ampullary cancer, including neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, and first-line or subsequent-line therapy for locally advanced, metastatic, and recurrent disease. Radiation therapy may be used in localized ampullary cancer, sometimes in combination with chemotherapy, but there is no high-level evidence to support its utility. Select tumors may be treated surgically. This article describes NCCN recommendations regarding management of ampullary adenocarcinoma.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Inflamed, prone-to-rupture coronary plaques are an important cause of myocardial infarction and their early identification is crucial. Atherosclerotic plaques are characterized by overexpression of the type-2 somatostatin receptor (SST2) in activated macrophages. SST2 ligand imaging (e.g. with [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC) has shown promise in detecting and quantifying the inflammatory activity within atherosclerotic plaques. However, the sensitivity of standard axial field of view (SAFOV) PET scanners may be suboptimal for imaging coronary arteries. Long-axial field of view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners may help overcome this limitation. We aim to assess the ability of [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC LAFOV-PET/CT in detecting calcified, SST2 overexpressing coronary artery plaques. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 108 oncological patients underwent [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT on a LAFOV system. [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake and calcifications in the coronary arteries were evaluated visually and semi-quantitatively. Data on patients' cardiac risk factors and coronary artery calcium score were also collected. Patients were followed up for 21.5 ± 3.4 months. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients (61.1%) presented with calcified coronary artery plaques. Of these, 32 patients had increased [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in at least one coronary vessel (TBR: 1.65 ± 0.53). Patients with single-vessel calcifications showed statistically significantly lower uptake (SUVmax 1.10 ± 0.28) compared to patients with two- (SUVmax 1.31 ± 0.29, p < 0.01) or three-vessel calcifications (SUVmax 1.24 ± 0.33, p < 0.01). There was a correlation between coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake, especially in the LAD (p = 0.02). Stroke and all-cause death occurred more frequently in patients with increased [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake (15.63% vs. 0%; p:0.001 and 21.88% vs. 6.58%; p: 0.04, respectively) during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC as a marker for the macrophage activity can reveal unknown cases of inflamed calcified coronary artery plaques using a LAFOV PET system. [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake increased with the degree of calcification and correlated with higher risk of stroke and all-cause death. [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC LAFOV PET/CT may be useful to assess patients' cardiovascular risk.",

        "abstract": "Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a bioenergy model crop valued for its energy efficiency and drought tolerance. The related monocot species rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays) deploy species-specific, specialized metabolites as core stress defenses. By contrast, specialized chemical defenses in switchgrass are largely unknown. To investigate specialized metabolic drought responses in switchgrass, we integrated tissue-specific transcriptome and metabolite analyses of the genotypes Alamo and Cave-in-Rock that feature different drought tolerance. The more drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock featured an earlier onset of transcriptomic changes and significantly more differentially expressed genes in response to drought compared to Alamo. Specialized pathways showed moderate differential expression compared to pronounced transcriptomic alterations in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. However, diterpenoid-biosynthetic genes showed drought-inducible expression in Alamo roots, contrasting largely unaltered triterpenoid and phenylpropanoid pathways. Metabolomic analyses identified common and genotype-specific flavonoids and terpenoids. Consistent with transcriptomic alterations, several root diterpenoids showed significant drought-induced accumulation, whereas triterpenoid abundance remained predominantly unchanged. Structural analysis verified select drought-responsive diterpenoids as oxygenated furanoditerpenoids. Drought-dependent transcriptome and metabolite profiles provide the foundation to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying switchgrass drought responses. Accumulation of specialized root diterpenoids and corresponding pathway transcripts supports a role in drought stress tolerance.",

Weak interactions between the catalyst and substrate were studied using energy decomposition and noncovalent interaction analyses, which unmasked an important role of the 2-bromophenyl substituent that has been used in multiple β-lactone-forming C-H insertion reactions. Small and large catalysts were shown to behave differently, with the latter providing a means of overcoming dynamically preferred fragmentation by lowering the barrier for the recombination of the product fragments in the grip of the large catalyst active site cavity.",

        "abstract": "Advances in sequencing techniques have made comparative studies of gene expression a current focus for understanding evolutionary and developmental processes. However, insights into the spatial expression of genes have been limited by a lack of robust methodology. To overcome this obstacle, we developed methods and software tools for quantifying and comparing tissue-wide spatial patterns of gene expression within and between species. Here, we compare cortex-wide expression of RZRβ and Id2 mRNA across early postnatal development in mice and voles. We show that patterns of RZRβ expression in neocortical layer 4 are highly conserved between species but develop rapidly in voles and much more gradually in mice, who show a marked expansion in the relative size of the putative primary visual area across the first postnatal week. Patterns of Id2 expression, by contrast, emerge in a dynamic and layer-specific sequence that is consistent between the two species. We suggest that these differences in the development of neocortical patterning reflect the independent evolution of brains, bodies, and sensory systems in the 35 million years since their last common ancestor.",

However, different portions of this large architectonic zone may serve different functions related to reaching and grasping behaviors. The current study used multiunit recording techniques in anesthetized macaque monkeys to survey a large extent of the rostral bank of the IPS so that hundreds of recording sites could be used to determine the functional subdivisions and topographic organization of cortical areas in this region. We identified a lateral area on the rostral IPS that we term area 5L. Area 5L contains neurons with receptive fields on mostly the shoulder, forelimb, and digits, with no apparent representation of other body parts. Thus, there is a large magnification of the forelimb. Receptive fields for neurons in this region often contain multiple joints of the forelimb or multiple digits, which results in imprecise topography or fractures in map organization. Our results provide the first overall topographic map of area 5L obtained in individual macaque monkeys and suggest that this region is distinct from more medial portions of the IPS.",

        "abstract": "We examined the effects of focal lesions of posterior parietal area 5 in macaque monkeys on bimanual behavior performed with and without visual guidance. The animals were trained on two reaching tasks and one tactile texture discrimination task. Task 1 simply involved reaching toward and grasping a reward from one of five well positions. Task 2 required the monkey to use both hands simultaneously to obtain a reward. The tactile texture discrimination task required the monkey to signal the roughness of a passively delivered texture using its jaw. After lesions to area 5, the monkeys showed a decrease in hand use for tasks 1 and 2 and an inability to perform task 2 in specific locations in visual space. These deficits recovered within several days. No deficits were observed in the tactile texture discrimination task or in an analgesic control monkey. Electrophysiological recordings made just before the lesion, immediately after the lesion, and 2 months after the lesion demonstrated that cortical areas just rostral to the lesioned area 5, and areas 1 and 2, were topographically reorganized and that receptive fields for neurons in these fields changed location on the body surface. These cortical map changes are correlative and may, in part, contribute to the rapid behavioral recovery observed. The mechanism for such rapid changes may be the unmasking of existing divergent and convergent thalamocortical connections that are part of the normal cortical circuitry.",

We found that the somatosensory thalamus is composed of several representations of cutaneous and deep receptors of the contralateral body. These nuclei include the ventral posterior nucleus, the ventral posterior superior nucleus, the ventral posterior inferior nucleus, and the ventral lateral nucleus. Each nucleus projects to several different cortical fields, and each cortical field receives projections from multiple thalamic nuclei. In contrast to other sensory systems, each of these somatosensory cortical fields is uniquely innervated by multiple thalamic nuclei.

        "abstract": "The contribution of sensory input to the formation of sensory system-specific (sensoritopic) connections of the thalamus and midbrain was investigated using mice lacking the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) or the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoform2 (PMCA2). Because these mice are congenitally deaf, the developing nervous system has no exposure to sensory-driven neural activity from the auditory system. Here we compared the retinofugal pathway in normal and congenitally deaf mice using intraocular injections of neuroanatomical tracers into each eye, and relating tracer patterns to identified thalamic nuclei and superior colliculus layers. We demonstrate that loss of such activity results in aberrant projections of the retina into nonvisual auditory structures such as the medial geniculate nucleus and the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus. These findings indicate that activity from peripheral sensory receptor arrays is necessary not only for the refinement of developing connections within a unimodal structure, but for the establishment of sensoritopic or sensory-specific connections of unimodal and multimodal structures. We hypothesize that specification of such connections may occur through the modulation of spatial expression patterns of molecules known to be involved in the development of topography of connections between brain structures, such as the ephrins, via activity-dependent, CRE-mediated gene expression.",

        "abstract": "We employed a multi-scale clustering methodology known as \"data cloud geometry\" to extract functional connectivity patterns derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol. The method was applied to correlation matrices of 106 regions of interest (ROIs) in 29 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and 29 individuals with typical development (TD) while they completed a cognitive control task. Connectivity clustering geometry was examined at both \"fine\" and \"coarse\" scales. At the coarse scale, the connectivity clustering geometry produced 10 valid clusters with a coherent relationship to neural anatomy. A supervised learning algorithm employed fine scale information about clustering motif configurations and prevalence, and coarse scale information about intra- and inter-regional connectivity; the algorithm correctly classified ASD and TD participants with sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of 82.8%. Most of the predictive power of the logistic regression model resided at the level of the fine-scale clustering geometry, suggesting that cellular versus systems level disturbances are more prominent in individuals with ASD. This article provides validation for this multi-scale geometric approach to extracting brain functional connectivity pattern information and for its use in classification of ASD.",

        "abstract": "We develop a computational protocol for mimicking personal gait dynamics with 12-dimensional time series derived from 4 accelerometer sensors found in the MAREA database and then explore its utilities in line with precision learning of human activities. The foundation of mimicking high dimensional rhythmic dynamics is explicitly established upon deterministic and stochastic structures found on structural representations of evolving biomechanical states hidden within all computed gait cycles. Such a technique enables practitioners to detect and confirm minute structural changes that could last for only a few cycles with high precision. Our computational developments are step-by-step illustrated via one subject's data, while the other 8 subjects' data are also analyzed and compared accordingly. A common cyclic composition of evolving biomechanical states of various temporal scales emerges from the 9 subjects' comparisons. We conclude that mimicking an individual's gait dynamics offers precise detections of potential multiscale minute differences against gait dynamics of different time periods or of different persons, and further offers clues of efficiency on personal walking activity. This mimicking-based capability is a cornerstone for the proof of concept: dynamics mimicking enables precision learning by improving the efficiency of learning and performing human activities in competitive sports, social dancing, and physical rehabilitation, among many others.",

        "issued": "2014",
        "abstract": "We quantify the notion of pattern and formalize the process of pattern discovery under the framework of binary bipartite networks. Patterns of particular focus are interrelated global interactions between clusters on its row and column axes. A binary bipartite network is built into a thermodynamic system embracing all up-and-down spin configurations defined by product-permutations on rows and columns. This system is equipped with its ferromagnetic energy ground state under Ising model potential. Such a ground state, also called a macrostate, is postulated to congregate all patterns of interest embedded within the network data in a multiscale fashion. A new computing paradigm for indirect searching for such a macrostate, called Data Mechanics, is devised by iteratively building a surrogate geometric system with a pair of nearly optimal marginal ultrametrics on row and column spaces. The coupling measure minimizing the Gromov-Wasserstein distance of these two marginal geometries is also seen to be in the vicinity of the macrostate. This resultant coupling geometry reveals multiscale block pattern information that characterizes multiple layers of interacting relationships between clusters on row and on column axes. It is the nonparametric information content of a binary bipartite network. This coupling geometry is then demonstrated to shed new light and bring resolution to interaction issues in community ecology and in gene-content-based phylogenetics. Its implied global inferences are expected to have high potential in many scientific areas.",

        "abstract": "Lewis Carroll's English word game Doublets is represented as a system of networks with each node being an English word and each connectivity edge confirming that its two ending words are equal in letter length, but different by exactly one letter. We show that this system, which we call the Doublets net, constitutes a complex body of linguistic knowledge concerning English word structure that has computable multiscale features. Distributed morphological, phonological and orthographic constraints and the language's local redundancy are seen at the node level. Phonological communities are seen at the network level. And a balancing act between the language's global efficiency and redundancy is seen at the system level. We develop a new measure of intrinsic node-to-node distance and a computational algorithm, called community geometry, which reveal the implicit multiscale structure within binary networks. Because the Doublets net is a modular complex cognitive system, the community geometry and computable multi-scale structural information may provide a foundation for understanding computational learning in many systems whose network structure has yet to be fully analyzed.",

        "issued": "2014",
        "abstract": "High-frequency return, trading volume and transaction number are digitally coded via a nonparametric computing algorithm, called hierarchical factor segmentation (HFS), and then are coupled together to reveal a single stock dynamics without global state-space structural assumptions. The base-8 digital coding sequence, which is capable of revealing contrasting aggregation against sparsity of extreme events, is further compressed into a shortened sequence of state transitions. This compressed digital code sequence vividly demonstrates that the aggregation of large absolute returns is the primary driving force for stimulating both the aggregations of large trading volumes and transaction numbers. The state of system-wise synchrony is manifested with very frequent recurrence in the stock dynamics. And this data-driven dynamic mechanism is seen to correspondingly vary as the global market transiting in and out of contraction-expansion cycles. These results not only elaborate the stock dynamics of interest to a fuller extent, but also contradict some classical theories in finance. Overall this version of stock dynamics is potentially more coherent and realistic, especially when the current financial market is increasingly powered by high-frequency trading via computer algorithms, rather than by individual investors.",

Using caffeine additives, CS and graphic analogue scales (GS) gave similar bitterness response functions. Parabolic functions provided the best fit between concentration and ratings for CS, GS and ME. The data demonstrated no difference for ME of bitterness intensity between free or fixed moduli. Hedonic responses also were not modified by whether the modulus was free or fixed, however, greater ME values were ascribed to lower concentrations in the series when the reference was 4 g/L than when it was 2 g/L caffeine. CS intensity response distributions were similar between a series with a larger number of low levels versus a series with a larger number of high levels across the same concentration range. The results indicate that ME may be inappropriate for scaling of degree of liking, independent of type of modulus. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",

One hundred and five mothers of 1-year old children completed a survey in two consecutive years, answering questions about demographics, eating habits and FN. According to our results, independently of the country of origin, there is a significant increase in children's FN between 1 and 2 years of age (p <.001). Moreover, when all the data was analyzed together, mothers showed to be less neophobic than their children at 2 years of age, but not at 1 year of age (p <.001); however, this difference was not consistent across countries (p <.01). Among mothers, FNs differed according to the country of origin, with Californian mothers being the least neophobic (p <.01). Regarding the effect of children's eating habits on their levels of FN, the results showed that FN varied significantly with vegetable intake (p <.001) and food variety (p <.001), where the children who ate more vegetables and had a more varied diet were less neophobic. Finally, no significant difference in children's FN was found between genders.",

Sensory mitigation of sodium reduction through the incorporation of mushrooms was also investigated in the taco blends. The substitution of beef with mushrooms in the carne asada did not alter the overall flavor strength of the dish, but the incorporation of 50% or 80% ground mushroom in the beef taco blend did enhance its overall flavor as well as mushroom, veggie, onion, garlic and earthy flavors, and umami and sweet tastes. Overall flavor intensity of the 25% reduced-salt version of the 80% mushroom taco blend matched that of the full-salt versions of the 100% and 50% beef formulations, thus indicating that the substitution of 80% of the meat with mushrooms did mitigate the 25% sodium reduction in terms of the overall flavor impact of the dish, even if it did not quite compensate for the reduction in salty taste. This proof-of-concept study for the Healthy Flavors Research Initiative indicates that because of their flavor-enhancing umami principles, mushrooms can be used as a healthy substitute for meat and a mitigating agent for sodium reduction in meat-based dishes without loss of overall flavor.",

        "abstract": "We completed a series of studies to assess the acceptability of zinc-fortified, cereal-based complementary foods and zinc-fortified wheat breads. Young children and their caregivers completed acceptability tests with complementary foods fortified with iron only (60 mg iron as ferrous fumarate per kilogram cereal flour), or the same level of iron and zinc (240 mg zinc as zinc oxide per kilogram cereal flour), and the caregivers completed triangle taste tests to compare the same products. A separate group of adult participants completed acceptability tests with wheat breads fortified with iron and folic acid (15 mg iron as ferrous fumarate per kilogram flour and 1.5 mg folic acid per kilogram flour) or the same levels of iron-folic acid and 2 levels of zinc (63 mg zinc or 126 mg zinc as zinc oxide per kilogram flour). Finally, a threshold test was administered to another group of adult participants to compare nonfortified wheat bread to breads fortified with zinc in 80 mg increments ranging from 80 to 400 mg zinc as zinc oxide per kilogram flour. All products were acceptable when compared to non-zinc-fortified equivalents, and were well liked by the respective participants. For the triangle tests, caregivers were not able to detect significant differences between products. For threshold tests, adult participants detected differences in breads prepared from fortified wheat flour at 80 mg, 160 mg, and 320 mg zinc per kilogram flour, but not at 240 mg and 400 mg zinc per kilogram flour, respectively, when compared to nonfortified bread equivalents. Zinc fortification of cereal flours in the ranges of fortification that were tested does not adversely affect the acceptability of complementary foods and breads prepared from these flours. Practical Application: Fortification of staple food products is a low-cost approach to deliver additional micronutrients (including zinc) to large segments of a population. Determining the acceptability of products fortified with zinc is an important step in the development of zinc fortification programs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a major unmet medical need in clinical hepatology. Cilofexor is a nonsteroidal farnesoid X receptor agonist being evaluated for the treatment of PSC. Here, we describe the safety and preliminary efficacy of cilofexor in a 96-week, open-label extension (OLE) of a phase II trial. METHODS: Noncirrhotic subjects with large-duct PSC who completed the 12-week, blinded phase of a phase II study (NCT02943460) were eligible, after a 4-week washout period, for a 96-week OLE with cilofexor 100 mg daily. Safety, liver biochemistry, and serum markers of fibrosis, cellular injury, and pharmacodynamic effects of cilofexor (fibroblast growth factor 19, C4, and bile acids [BAs]) were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 52 subjects enrolled in the phase II study, 47 (90%) continued in the OLE phase (median age, 44 years; 60% male patients, 60% with inflammatory bowel disease, and 45% on ursodeoxycholic acid [UDCA]). At OLE baseline (BL), the median serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were 368 U/L (interquartile range [IQR], 277-468 U/L) and 417 U/L (IQR, 196-801 U/L), respectively. Of the 47 subjects enrolled, 15 (32%) discontinued treatment prematurely (pruritus [n = 5], other adverse events [n = 5], subject decision/investigator discretion [n = 5]). At week 96, reductions in liver biochemistry parameters occurred, including serum ALP (median, -8.3% [IQR, -25.9% to 11.0%]; P = .066), GGT (-29.8% [IQR, -42.3% to -13.9%]; P < .001), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) (-29.8% [IQR, -43.7% to -6.6%]; P = .002), and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) (-16.7% [IQR, -35.3% to 1.0%]; P = .010), and rebounded after 4 weeks of untreated follow-up. ALP response (≥20% reduction from BL to week 96) was similar in the presence or absence of UDCA therapy (29% vs 39%; P = .71). At week 96, cilofexor treatment was associated with a significant reduction in serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) (-29.8% [IQR, -64.3% to -8.5%]; P = .001). In subjects with detectable serum BAs at BL (n = 40), BAs decreased -23.9% (IQR, -44.4% to -0.6%; P = .006) at week 48 (n = 28) and -25.7% (IQR, -35.9% to 53.7%; P = .91) at week 96 (n = 26). Serum cytokeratin 18 (CK18) M30 and M65 were reduced throughout the OLE; significant reductions were observed at week 72 (CK18 M30, -17.3% [IQR, -39.3% to 8.8%]; P = .018; CK18 M65, -43.5% [IQR, -54.9% to 15.3%]; P = .096). At week 96, a small, but statistically significant absolute increase of 0.15 units in Enhanced Liver Fibrosis score was observed compared with BL (median, 9.34 vs 9.53; P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: In this 96-week OLE of a phase II study of PSC, cilofexor was safe and improved liver biochemistry and biomarkers of cholestasis and cellular injury.

        "abstract": "Multiple mechanisms of resistance contribute to the inevitable progression of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Currently approved therapies for CRPC include systemic chemotherapy (docetaxel and cabazitaxel) and agents targeting the resistance pathways leading to CRPC, including enzalutamide and abiraterone. While there is significant survival benefit, primary and secondary resistance to these therapies develops rapidly. Up to one-third of patients have primary resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone; the remaining patients eventually progress on treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance resulting in progression as well as identifying new targetable pathways remains the focus of current prostate cancer research. We review current knowledge of mechanisms of resistance to the currently approved treatments, development of adjunctive therapies, and identification of new pathways being targeted for therapeutic purposes.",

Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to quantify the effect of BMI on pathologic and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with normal weight patients, overweight and obese patients demonstrated higher pathologic Gleason grade and higher pathologic T stage, without any difference in preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels. Overweight and obese men were less likely to have a negative surgical margin (odds ratio (OR) 0.74 [confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.84, P<0.001] for overweight men and OR 0.66 [CI 0.49-0.89, P<0.01] for obese men) and had a lower rate of postoperative erectile function (OR 0.60 [CI 0.48-0.76, P<0.001] for overweight patients and OR 0.34 [CI 0.27-0.44, P<0.001] for obese patients). Moreover, duration of surgery and intraoperative blood loss increased significantly with an increase in BMI. When using BMI as a continuous variable, the same trends were demonstrated. However, a lower rate of continence was not evident for overweight or obese men. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to many other studies, in this cohort of patients with prostate cancer, BMI was an independent risk factor for most analyzed pathologic and functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy, including negative surgical margin, potency, duration of surgery, and intraoperative blood loss.",

Purpose: The impact of cardiopulmonary bypass in level III-IV tumor thrombectomy on surgical and oncologic outcomes is unknown. We determine the impact of cardiopulmonary bypass on overall and cancer specific survival, as well as surgical complication rates and immediate outcomes in patients undergoing nephrectomy and level III-IV tumor thrombectomy with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 362 patients with renal cell cancer and with level III or IV tumor thrombus from 1992 to 2012 at 22 U.S. and European centers. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare overall and cancer specific survival between patients with and without cardiopulmonary bypass. Perioperative mortality and complication rates were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Results: Median overall survival was 24.6 months in noncardiopulmonary bypass cases and 26.6 months in cardiopulmonary bypass cases. Overall survival and cancer specific survival did not differ significantly in both groups on univariate analysis or when adjusting for known risk factors. On multivariate analysis no significant differences were seen in hospital length of stay, Clavien 1-4 complication rate, intraoperative or 30-day mortality and cancer specific survival. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study. Conclusions: In our multi-institutional analysis the use of cardiopulmonary bypass did not significantly impact cancer specific survival or overall survival in patients undergoing nephrectomy and level III or IV tumor thrombectomy. Neither approach was independently associated with increased mortality on multivariate analysis. Greater surgical complications were not independently associated with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We evaluated the use and efficacy of intraoperative urinary diversion with ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube during pyeloplasty in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Faculty Practice Solutions Center® national billing database was queried to identify all pediatric pyeloplasties performed from 2009 to 2012. Patient variables, surgical approach, use of intraoperative stent/nephrostomy tube and return for postoperative stent/nephrostomy tube or second pyeloplasty were obtained. RESULTS: A total of 2,435 children underwent open (1,792) or laparoscopic/robotic (643) pyeloplasty, with intraoperative urinary diversion rates of 45% and 83%, respectively. Comparing patients with and without an intraoperative stent/nephrostomy tube, 5.6% and 7.4%, respectively, returned to the hospital for urinary diversion. Multivariable analysis revealed no association with surgical approach, but higher surgeon volume (p <0.01) and use of an intraoperative stent/nephrostomy tube (p <0.01) were associated with decreased odds of requiring postoperative urinary diversion. Second pyeloplasty rate was 3.8% and was not associated with surgical approach or use of intraoperative stent/nephrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative stent/nephrostomy tube use and increased surgeon volume were each independently associated with a significant but small decrease in risk of postoperative stent/nephrostomy tube placement. Use of an intraoperative stent/nephrostomy tube was not associated with rate of second (redo ipsilateral or contralateral metachronous) pyeloplasty.",

SD70, a competitive inhibitor of KDM4 class of histone demethylases, was demonstrated to have significant inhibitory effect on AR transactivation function in LNCaP cells and androgen-insensitive basal activity in CWR22Rv1. In-vitro assessment of efficacy in CWR22Rv1 cells demonstrated cytotoxity at 5 μM. We aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of SD70 in CRPC cell lines, determine its effect in conjunction with currently approved therapies, and identify a useful biomarker for this novel drug.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Using MTT viability assays, we first assessed SD70 dosing against two CRPC lines (C42B and GRP), then against C42B drug-resistant strains (abiratarone, enzalutamide, abi+enza, docetaxel). For the resistant lines, cells were then treated with 1 μM SD70 in combination with 10 μM abiratarone, 10 μM enzalutamide or 1 nM docetaxel. In vivo drug study was conducted with mouse xenograft models (3 million CWR22Rv1 cells via s.c. injection) in athymic nude mice. When the tumor volume reached 100 mm3, animals were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg/kg SD70 or vehicle via i.p. injection daily. Tumor monitoring was continued until tumor burden exceeded humane endpoint limits indicated by IACUC.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>RESULTS:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>SD70 demonstrated complete cytotoxic response at 5 μM against C42B and GRP cell lines; IC50 was 2.1 μM and 2.9 μM, respectively. All drug-resistant C42B cell lines were responsive to SD70 treatment; IC50 ranged from 0.90-1.57 μM. SD70 was found to be synergistic with abiratarone, enzalutamide, and docetaxel against drug-resistant C42B and GRP cell lines. In the CWR22Rv1 mouse xenograft model, SD70-treated mice demonstrated significantly lower tumor volume at the end of treatment period (SD70: 507.31±203.72 mm3, control: 2388.01±543.58 mm3); no significant drug toxicity was observed. Expression of AR surrogate markers (PSA, KLK2, TMPRSS2) were diminished in C42B and enzalutamide-resistant C42B lines treated with SD70. No changes in autophagy reporter LC-3 or activation of Akt was observed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>SD70 demonstrates promising cytotoxic efficacy against CRPC cells lines in vitro, and appears to have a synergistic effect with currently approved CRPC medications (docetaxel, enzalutamide, and abiratarone) in drug-resistant CRPC lines. Initial in vivo trial demonstrated excellent efficacy against CWR22Rv1 without significant toxicity. Ongoing evaluation into identifying biomarkers will allow for further evaluation of this promising new agent.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Thenappan Chandrasekar, Joy C.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) recommendations for managing intimal (grade 1) blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs) include observation and medical management. University of Washington (UW) revised criteria suggest that intimal injuries with ≥1 cm flap should be upgraded to a moderate injury and treatment be considered. We sought to evaluate and compare SVS and UW criteria for BTAI and determine how discordance in grading affected treatment and outcome. METHODS: We reviewed all patients admitted with BTAI from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2022. Data included injury grading, demographics, and concomitant traumatic injuries. Images were reviewed to categorize the injury with both grading systems. Treatment and outcomes were analyzed for concordant and discordant groups. RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 208 patients after excluding four who died upon arrival. The mean age was 45 ± 19 years, 69% were men, and the median injury severity score was 34 (interquartile range, 26-45). Strong agreement was observed between the grading systems (kappa = 0.88). All patients with concordant grade 1 injuries (n = 54) were observed. SVS grade 1/2 BTAIs were reclassified in 12 of 71 patients (16.9%). Two (28.6%) SVS grade 2 injuries were graded lower with the UW criteria; neither patient required immediate or delayed repair. Ten (15.6%) SVS grade 1 BTAIs were graded higher with UW criteria. Of these, six underwent repair (one for preoperative embolization), and four were observed without sequalae. Overall mortality was 7.7% with no difference for concordant or discordant grades (7.7% vs 8.3%; P = .99). No aneurysm-related mortalities were observed. Follow-up imaging was available for 94 survivors (49.0%) at a median of 193 days (interquartile range, 42-522 days). Two patients unrepaired at the index hospitalization (SVS grade 3/UW grade 2) underwent successful delayed repair. No patient observed for a minimal injury had BTAI progression or required treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The UW grading system may upgrade or downgrade SVS grade 1 or 2 BTAI for as many as one in six injuries. Upgraded injuries should prompt consideration of repair if there is evidence of flap progression or thromboembolic complications. Downgraded injuries suggest that treatment may not be necessary; clinical expertise is key to determine optimal management in these patients.",

Plasma has been suggested to restore microvascular integrity by preservation and repair of the EG. We sought to evaluate whether plasma administered in a 1:1:1 ratio was associated with less endothelial marker circulation than a 1:1:2 ratio. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the PROPPR trial, which investigated post-traumatic resuscitation with platelets, plasma, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio. Syndecan-1, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were quantified for each treatment group on admission and at 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Patients were excluded if they did not survive longer than 3 hours or had data from fewer than two time points. RESULTS: Three hundred eight patients in the 1:1:1 group and 291 in the 1:1:2 group were analyzed. There were no statistically significant differences in syndecan-1, sTM, or RAGE between treatment groups at any time point ( p > 0.05). Patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and death had significantly elevated biomarker expression at most time points when compared with patients who did not develop these sequelae ( p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Administration of FFP in a 1:1:1 ratio does not consistently affect circulation of endothelial biomarkers following significant trauma when compared with a 1:1:2 ratio. The development of post-traumatic ARDS, AKI, and death was associated with increased endothelial biomarker circulation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care Management; Level III.",

Rapid-TEG (rTEG), kaolin-TEG (kTEG), and native-TEG (nTEG) were performed on blood samples from burn patients presenting to a regional center from admission to 21 days. Patients were categorized by burn severity, mortality, and fibrinolytic phenotypes (Shutdown [SD], Physiologic [PHYS], and Hyperfibrinolytic [HF]). Manufacturer ranges and published TEG cutoffs were examined. Concordance correlations (Rc) of TEG parameters (R, α-angle, maximum amplitude [MA], LY30) measured agreement and Cohen's Kappa (κ) determined interclass reliability. Patients (n = 121) were mostly male (n = 84; 69.4%), with median age 40 years, median TBSA burn 13%, and mortality 17% (n = 21). Severe burns (≥40% TBSA) were associated with lower admission α-angle for rTEG (P = .03) and lower MA for rTEG (P = .02) and kTEG (P = .01). MA was lower in patients who died (nTEG, P = .04; kTEG, P = .02; rTEG, P = .003). Admission HF was associated with increased mortality (OR, 10.45; 95% CI, 2.54-43.31, P = .001) on rTEG only. Delayed SD was associated with mortality using rTEG and nTEG (OR 9.46; 95% CI, 1.96-45.73; P = .005 and OR, 6.91; 95% CI, 1.35-35.48; P = .02). Admission TEGs showed poor agreement on R-time (Rc, 0.00-0.56) and α-angle (0.40 to 0.55), and moderate agreement on MA (0.67-0.81) and LY30 (0.72-0.93). Interclass reliability was lowest for R-time (κ, -0.07 to 0.01) and α-angle (-0.06 to 0.17) and highest for MA (0.22-0.51) and LY30 (0.29-0.49).

        "abstract": "This retrospective observational study aimed to characterize the severity and distribution of OA in the stifle joints of small and medium dogs with CCL injury and/or MPL. Radiographs of the stifle joints from 218 dogs from 10 small and medium breeds were included; 127 joints had CCL injury, 76 joints had MPL, and 73 joints had CCL injury and MPL. OA was graded at 33 sites within the joint. The mean ± SD OA score was 20.3 ± 9.9. For all joints, OA was more severe in heavier than lighter dogs (P = 0.003). Joints with MPL (14.9 ± 8.2) had lower OA scores than joints with CCL injury (22.2 ± 10.0, P = 0.003) or CCL injury and MPL (22.6 ± 9.4, P < 0.001). OA scores were higher in joints with MPL for older dogs (r = 0.408, P < 0.001) but did not change with age in joints with CCL injury. The pattern of OA did not differ among joints with CCL injury or MPL. The retrospective nature of the study limited findings to associations but did not allow conclusions regarding factors causing OA or enhancing its progression. We concluded that, in small- and medium-breed dogs, the patterns of stifle OA joint after CCL injury and MPL are similar. Radiographic OA after CCL injury is more severe than MPL. An increase in age leads to an increase in OA at the time of presentation at a referral hospital in stifle joints with MPL and without CCL injury.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To understand relative frequency of adverse health events, defined as injuries or infectious diseases, in dogs participating in agility and to determine health research priorities of agility dog owners. PROCEDURES: An internet-based questionnaire distributed to agility dog owners included items related to experiences with infectious diseases and injuries in agility dogs, reasons for retirement of dogs from competition, and ranking of health research priorities. Frequencies of infectious diseases in US geographic regions were compared with Chi-square tests. Research priority rankings were determined as median and interquartile range (IQR) for each topic. Rank-based tests (Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney) compared rankings between participants in different agility organizations, between veterinarian and non-veterinarian competitors, and between respondents who had competed in national championship events and other respondents. RESULTS: There were 1,322 respondents who had competed in canine agility in the previous 6 months, with those respondents reporting a median time competing in the sport of 13 years (IQR = 8-20 years); 50% of respondents had competed in at least one national championship agility event in the preceding 5 years. Overall, 1,015 respondents (77%) indicated that one or more of their dogs had been injured and approximately one-third (n = 477, 36%) indicated that one or more dogs had likely acquired one or more infectious diseases as a result of agility activities. Specific types of infectious diseases acquired varied by geographic region in the US. Research priority rankings were similar regardless of preferred agility organization or respondent experience. The highest-ranking research topics were identification of risk factors for specific types of injuries, improvements in equipment and understanding of safe course design, and physical conditioning programs to prevent injury. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Agility competitors prioritize research in areas that advance understanding of injury prevention in their dogs. Research priorities are nearly uniform among competitors regardless of their preferred agility organization or level of experience, providing a strong rationale for agility organizations to collaborate in research initiatives that improve safety and well-being for dogs competing in the sport. There has been little published research focusing on the high-priority research areas identified by competitors.",

Studying the teeth and jaws of an array of species can present a challenge requiring attention to detail and understanding of a species' normal anatomy. In the present article, a systematic and precise protocol for examining skull specimens is discussed that has been applied to a variety of mammals to define characteristic diseases in the oromaxillofacial region. The procedure outlined is simultaneously precise, repeatable, and adaptable to the highly differing skull and tooth shapes and anatomy across species. Specifically, specimens are examined for missing teeth, periodontal disease, endodontal disease, TMJ pathology, and anatomical variations. Results gleaned from research on museum specimens may reflect the natural history, health, and disease status of individuals and species. Furthermore, these data can inform ecological and conservation research efforts, as well as the care of captive individuals.",

        "abstract": "Management of complications of fracture fixation in the oromaxillofacial (OMF) region may present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. While titanium and stainless steel implants have been utilized in successful fracture fixation in the OMF region, the use of titanium implants is preferred due to the superior intrinsic properties of titanium. Nonetheless, stainless steel materials are still used due to their availability and familiarity. In the present methods report, we describe our approach to the management of failed stainless steel plates and screws used to treat traumatic injuries in the OMF region. Furthermore, we exemplify our approach with five dogs that exhibited complications of stainless steel implants in the OMF region and their subsequent management. In those cases, all failed implants were removed. Reconstruction with a combination of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and titanium implants was utilized in two cases while a mandibulectomy was performed in one case. Three cases required removal of the stainless-steel implant with no additional surgical therapy. We conclude that the success of treatment of failed stainless steel implants depends on the use of advanced imaging findings, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as well as potentially regenerative reconstructive surgery.",

As with other conditions resulting in decreased or restricted mandibular range of motion, severe and potentially fatal sequelae such as difficulty with prehension, swallowing, and air exchange are possible. Diagnostic imaging is essential in achieving an accurate diagnosis and in formulating an appropriate treatment plan.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe an intraoral approach (IOA) for zygomatic sialadenectomy in dogs and to compare this surgical approach to a modified lateral orbitotomy approach (LOA). STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric study and short case series. SAMPLE POPULATION: Ten canine cadavers and three dogs with clinical disease. METHODS: Bilateral zygomatic sialoadenectomies were performed in six mesocephalic, two brachycephalic and two dolichocephalic cadavers, randomly assigned to IOA on one side and LOA on the contralateral side. Duration of surgery, ease of surgical stage scores (rated on 5-point Likert scale) and completeness of gland removal were recorded. Additionally, IOA was performed in three dogs with zygomatic salivary gland (ZSG) disease. RESULTS: Removal of the ZSG was complete in 8/10 and 10/10 dogs using the IOA and LOA, respectively. Surgery was faster with IOA (42.0 min; 33.5-49.6 min) than LOA (65.7 min; 54.9-76.4 min, p = .005). Ease of removal did not differ between approaches (p = .091). Diseased ZSGs were successfully removed in three dogs without intra- or short-term postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The intraoral approach described here was technically equally challenging but faster than the LOA. Its clinical use led to an uneventful surgery with excellent short-term outcome in three dogs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The IOA provides an alternative approach for zygomatic sialoadenectomy in dogs with ZSG disease.",

        "abstract": "Management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) fractures is challenging and is a subject of ongoing discussions and controversies in both the veterinary and human medical fields. Regardless of the management strategy, obtaining precise diagnostic imaging in the form of conventional or cone-beam computed tomography and potentially magnetic resonance imaging is pivotal for medical and surgical decision-making and prognostic purposes. The main objective of TMJ fracture management is a rapid return to normal function via restoration of pretrauma occlusion, range of motion, and masticatory function. With that in mind, it is prudent to distinguish between surgical interventions, such as condylectomy and open reduction with internal fixation, or to elect a conservative management approach. Given the diversity in TMJ fracture and patient circumstances, such as age, concomitant trauma, financial situation, and availability of expertise, the formulation of an individualized treatment plan is recommended. Knowledge of potential short- and long-term complications such as infection, malocclusion, ankylosis, fibrosis, and osteoarthritis is essential during TMJ fracture management. Importantly, as our clinical and research knowledge on managing TMJ fractures in dogs and cats grows, we rely on comparative evidence-based overviews, and inspirations from human medical experts to advance the veterinary field. Hence, this review discusses contemporary approaches to managing TMJ fractures and the outcomes in dogs and cats from a one-health perspective.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model training solution, denoted as Adaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model parameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its centroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of features around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster to derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes away from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective function that aims to concentrate each class's features toward their corresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This methodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are pushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to, effectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an adversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative method consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2) anti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity training. Gravity's efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding fooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD using LeNet and ResNet110 networks, benchmarked against MNIST and CIFAR10 classification problems. Test results show that Gravity not only functions as a powerful instrument to robustify a model against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks but also effectively improves the model training accuracy.",

        "abstract": "One of the pivotal security threats for embedded computing systems is malicious softwarea.k.a malware. With efficiency and efficacy, Machine Learning (ML) has been widely adopted for malware detection in recent times. Despite being efficient, the existing techniques require updating the ML model frequently with newer benign and malware samples for training and modeling an efficient malware detector. Furthermore, such constraints limit the detection of emerging malware samples due to the lack of sufficient malware samples required for efficient training. To address such concerns, we introduce a code-aware data generation-based few-shot learning technique. CAD-FSL generates multiple mutated samples of the limitedly seen malware for efficient malware detection. Loss minimization ensures that the generated samples closely mimic the limitedly seen malware, restore malware functionality and mitigate the impractical samples. Such developed synthetic malware is incorporated into the training set to formulate the model that can efficiently detect the emerging malware despite having limited (few-shot) exposure. The experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed \"Code-Aware Data Generation\"technique, we detect malware with 90% accuracy, which is approximately 9% higher while training classifiers with only limitedly available training data.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, security researchers have shifted their attentions to the underlying processors' architecture and proposed Hardware-Based Malware Detection (HMD) countermeasures to address inefficiencies of software-based detection methods. HMD techniques apply standard Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to the processors' low-level events collected from Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) registers. However, despite obtaining promising results for detecting known malware, the challenge of accurate zero-day (unknown) malware detection has remained an unresolved problem in existing HPC-based countermeasures. Our comprehensive analysis shows that standard ML classifiers are not effective in recognizing zero-day malware traces using HPC events. In response, we propose Deep-HMD, a two-stage intelligent and flexible approach based on deep neural network and transfer learning, for accurate zero-day malware detection based on image-based hardware events. The experimental results indicate that our proposed solution outperforms existing ML-based methods by achieving a 97% detection rate (F-Measure and Area Under the Curve) for detecting zero-day malware signatures at run-time using the top 4 hardware events with a minimal false positive rate and no hardware redesign overhead.",

The amount of detectable virus, visualized in the past either by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization (ISH), has been modest in fixed or frozen tissues. This complicates our understanding of the widespread lymphoid proliferation, epithelial necrosis/apoptosis, and arteritis-phlebitis that characterize MCF. In this work, we developed a probe-based in situ hybridization assay targeting 2 ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) genes, as well as their respective transcripts, in formalin-fixed tissues. Using this approach, OvHV-2 nucleic acids were detected in lymphocytes in MCF-affected animals following both natural infection (American bison and domestic cattle) and experimental infection (American bison, rabbits, and pigs). The probe did not cross-react with 4 closely related gammaherpesviruses that also cause MCF: alcelaphine herpesvirus 1, alcelaphine herpesvirus 2, caprine herpesvirus 2, and ibex-MCF virus (MCFV). No signal was detected in control tissues negative for OvHV-2. ISH will be of value in analyzing the natural progression of OvHV-2 infection in time-course studies following experimental infection and in addressing the pathogenesis of MCF.",

Fungi identified in these cases included Beauveria bassiana, Beauveria brongniartii, Metarhizium anisopliae, Metarhizium robertsii, and one case of infection by a novel Metarhizium species. The animals were either housed at zoos or brought into rehabilitation from the wild. Although the majority of animals had comorbidities, the fungal infections were believed to be the primary cause of death. Fungal susceptibility testing was performed on two Beauveria spp. isolates, and revealed lower minimum inhibitory concentrations for itraconazole and voriconazole when compared to terbinafine and fluconazole. This case series demonstrates that a variety of reptile species from different orders are vulnerable to infection with Metarhizium, and multiple species of sea turtle are susceptible to infection with Beauveria.",

In 2018, red panda amdoparvovirus (RPAV) was discovered by metagenomics analyses of tissues from two geriatric red pandas, and in one case it was associated with significant lesions. Because RPAV was discovered in a single zoo cohort, it was unclear whether these infections represented a widely distributed, enzootic virus of red pandas or a localized 'spillover' from a different host species into this collection. The first goal of this study was to estimate the prevalence of RPAV in US zoos. The authors amplified RPAV from feces of 104 individual red pandas from 37 US zoos, and the virus was detected in 52/104 samples (50.0%). Next, to establish persistence of infection in individual animals, the authors tested serial samples in a single cohort over a 4.5-yr period, and virus was consistently shed by infected animals throughout the sampling period. Finally, full viral coding sequences were amplified and sequenced from three cases, and partial sequences of both the nonstructural and capsid genes were obtained for an additional 19 cases. RPAV is a genetically diverse but monophyletic viral species, and multiple viral lineages are present in US zoo-housed red pandas. The authors do not know how red pandas were originally infected, but RPAV is very common in red pandas in the United States, and infections are persistent-presumably for the lifetime of the animal.",

        "abstract": "Striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) densely populate the human-animal interface of suburbia throughout North America. Skunks share that habitat with numerous related mesocarnivores, where increased contact, competition for shared food and water sources and other stressors contribute to increased exposure and susceptibility to viral infection. The recently identified skunk amdoparvovirus (SKAV) has been detected at high prevalence in skunks and occasionally in mink, but its distribution in North America is unknown. To understand the impact of SKAV in striped skunks and the risk posed to related species, we investigated the geographic distribution of SKAV, analysed its genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics and evaluated viral distribution in tissues of infected animals to identify possible mechanisms of transmission. SKAV was detected in 72.5% (37/51) skunks and was present at high rates at all locations tested across North America. Analysis of the complete genomic sequence of 29 strains showed a clear geographic segregation, frequent recombination and marked differences in the evolutionary dynamics of the major structural (VP2) and non-structural (NS1) proteins. NS1 was characterized by a higher variability and a higher percentage of positively selected codons. This could indicate that antibody-mediated enhancement of infection occurs in SKAV, an infection strategy that may be conserved across amdoparvoviruses. Finally, in situ hybridization revealed virus in epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and skin, indicating that viral transmission could occur via oronasal, faecal and/or urinary secretions, as well as from skin and hair. The endemicity of SKAV over large geographic distances and its high genetic diversity suggest a long-term virus-host association. Persistent shedding and high environmental stability likely contribute to efficient viral spread, simultaneously offering opportunities for cross-species transmission with consequent risk to sympatric species, including domestic animals and wildlife.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Parvoviruses have been shown to exist in sheep since 1987. To this date there are only three reports pertaining to the existence parvoviruses in sheep. The first reported parvovirus study did not provide genomic information whereas the latter two belonged to the tetraparvovirus and copiparvovirus genera. This study focused on discovering the possible reasons of encephalitis and anemia in a dead sheep whose tissue samples were submitted to our laboratory. Methods: In the present study next-generation sequencing (NGS) was utilized. Nextera™ XT Sample Preparation Kit was used to generate a library for Illumina MiSeq using dual barcoding. An in-house pipeline was used for analyzing raw data generated from Miseq. Several software were used to create in housepipeline to trim sequences and de novo assembly. For the alignment genome and phylogenetic tree Geneious and MEGA X software were used. Results: A novel ovine chaphamaparvovirus and pestivirus D both were characterized simultaneously. Although chaphamaparvoviruses had had been reported in various animals, this is the first time they have been reported in sheep. PCR analyses confirmed the presence of chaphamaparvovirus in multiple tissues. The partial nonstructural protein (NS1) and the complete capsid proteins (VP1) protein sequences displayed the closest amino acid identity of 49% and 69%, respectively, to the proteins of a non-human primate chapparvovirus from Macaca fascicularis. Conclusion: This ovine parvovirus is the fourth parvovirus and the first chaphamaparvovirus reported in sheep. Both chaphamaparvovirus and pestivirus were shown to co-exist simultaneously in sheep. The role of this dual virus infection in the disease signs of this sheep remains to be determined. This study will shed light on future chaphamaparvovirus studies in sheep.",

        "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection induced post-weaning diarrhea is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in newly weaned pigs and one of the significant drivers for antimicrobial use in swine production. ETEC attachment to the small intestine initiates ETEC colonization and infection. The secretion of enterotoxins further disrupts intestinal barrier function and induces intestinal inflammation in weaned pigs. ETEC infection can also aggravate the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis due to weaning stress and increase the susceptibility of weaned pigs to other enteric infectious diseases, which may result in diarrhea or sudden death. Therefore, the amount of antimicrobial drugs for medical treatment purposes in major food-producing animal species is still significant. The alternative practices that may help reduce the reliance on such antimicrobial drugs and address animal health requirements are needed. Nutritional intervention in order to enhance intestinal health and the overall performance of weaned pigs is one of the most powerful practices in the antibiotic-free production system. This review summarizes the utilization of several categories of feed additives or supplements, such as direct-fed microbials, prebiotics, phytochemicals, lysozyme, and micro minerals in newly weaned pigs. The current understanding of these candidates on intestinal health and disease resistance of pigs under ETEC infection are particularly discussed, which may inspire more research on the development of alternative practices to support food-producing animals.",

        "abstract": "Postnatal growth retardation (PGR) is common in piglets. Abnormal development in small intestine was casually implicated in impaired growth, but the exact mechanism is still implausible. The present study unveiled transcriptome profile of jejunal mucosa, the major site of nutrient absorption, in PGR and healthy piglets using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The middle segments of jejunum and ileum, and jejunal mucosa were obtained from healthy and PGR piglets at 42 d of age. Total RNA samples extracted from jejunal mucosa of healthy and PGR piglets were submitted for RNA-seq. Lower villus height was observed in both jejunum and ileum from PGR piglets suggesting structural impairment in small intestine (P < 0.05). RNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced, and produced average 4.8 × 107 clean reads. Analysis revealed a total of 499 differently expressed genes (DEGs), of which 320 DEGs were downregulated in PGR piglets as compared to healthy piglets. The functional annotation based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) highlighted that most DEGs were involved in nutrient metabolism and immune responses. Our results further indicated decreased gene expression associated with glucose, lipid, protein, mineral, and vitamin metabolic process, detoxication ability, oxidoreductase activity, and mucosal barrier function; as well as the increased insulin resistance and inflammatory response in the jejunal mucosa of PGR piglets. These results characterized the transcriptomic profile of the jejunal mucosa in PGR piglets, and could provide valuable information with respect to better understanding the nutrition metabolism and immune responses in the small intestine of piglets.",

        "abstract": "A previous study has demonstrated that early weaning significantly suppressed hepatic glucose metabolism in piglets. Glutamate (Glu), aspartate (Asp) and glutamine (Gln) are major metabolic fuels for the small intestine and can alleviate weaning stress, and therefore might improve hepatic energy metabolism. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of administration of Glu, Asp and Gln on the expression of hepatic genes and proteins involved in lipid metabolism in post-weaning piglets. Thirty-six weaned piglets were assigned to the following treatments: control diet (Control; basal diet + 15.90 g/kg alanine); Asp, Gln and Glu-supplemented diet (Control + AA; basal diet + 1.00 g/kg Asp + 5.00 g/kg Glu + 10.00 g/kg Gln); and the energy-restricted diet supplemented with Asp, Gln and Glu (Energy- + AA; energy deficient diet + 1.00 g/kg Asp + 5.00 g/kg Glu + 10.00 g/kg Gln). Liver samples were obtained on d 5 and 21 post-weaning. Piglets fed Energy- + AA diet had higher liver mRNA abundances of acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), as well as higher protein expression of serine/threonine protein kinase 11 (LKB1), phosphor-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (P-ACC) and SIRT1 compared with piglets fed control diet (P < 0.05) on d 5 post-weaning. Control + AA diet increased liver malic enzyme 1 (ME1) and SIRT1 mRNA levels, as well as protein expression of LKB1 and P-ACC on d 5 post-weaning (P < 0.05). On d 21 post-weaning, compared to control group, Glu, Gln and Asp supplementation up-regulated the mRNA levels of ACOX1, ME1 and SIRT1 (P < 0.05). These findings indicated that dietary Glu, Gln and Asp supplementation could improve hepatic lipid metabolism to some extent, which may provide nutritional intervention for the insufficient energy intake after weaning in piglets.",

However, these benefits may vary depending on major active components in the final feed additive products. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate two types of botanical blends (BB) that were comprised of 0.3% capsicum oleoresin and 12% garlic extracts from different sources on performance, diarrhea, and health of weaned piglets experimentally infected with a pathogenic Escherichia coli F18. Sixty weanling pigs (7.17 ± 0.97 kg body weight (BW)) blocked by weight and gender were assigned to one of five dietary treatments: negative control (NC), positive control (PC), or dietary supplementation with 100 mg/kg of BB1, 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg of BB2. This study lasted 28 d with 7 d before and 21 d after the first E. coli inoculation (day 0). All pigs, except negative control, were orally inoculated with 1010 cfu E. coli F18/3-mL dose for 3 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected periodically to analyze systemic immunity. Intestinal tissues and mucosa were collected on days 5 and 21 PI for analyzing histology and gene expression. All data, except for frequency of diarrhea, were analyzed by ANOVA using the PROC MIXED of SAS. The Chi-square test was used for analyzing frequency of diarrhea. Escherichia coli infection reduced (P < 0.05) growth rate and feed intake and increased (P < 0.05) frequency of diarrhea of weaned pigs throughout the experiment. Supplementation of 100 mg/kg BB1 or BB2 alleviated (P < 0.05) frequency of diarrhea of E. coli challenged pigs during the entire experiment. Escherichia coli infection also enhanced (P < 0.05) serum TNF-α and haptoglobin concentrations on day 4 post-inoculation (PI) but reduced (P < 0.05) duodenal villi height and area on day 5 PI, while pigs supplemented with 100 mg/kg BB1 or BB2 had lower (P < 0.05) serum TNF-α than pigs in PC on day 4 PI. Pigs fed with 100 mg/kg BB2 had higher (P < 0.05) jejunal villi height than pigs in PC on day 5 PI. Pigs fed with 100 mg/kg BB2 had reduced (P < 0.05) gene expression of IL1B, PTGS2, and TNFA in ileal mucosa than pigs in PC on day 21 PI. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of botanical blends at 100 mg/kg could enhance disease resistance of weaned pigs infected with E. coli F18 by enhancing intestinal morphology and regulating local and systemic immunity of pigs.",

        "abstract": "Our previous research reported that supplementation of Bacillus subtilis DSM 25841 promoted growth and disease resistance of weaned pigs under enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) challenge and its efficacy is comparable to carbadox. This follow-up study aimed to characterize the effects of ETEC infection, supplementing B. subtilis DSM 25841 or carbadox on intestinal microbiota of pigs. Forty-eight weaned pigs (6.17 ± 0.36 kg BW) were randomly allotted to one of four treatments: negative control (NC), positive control (PC), antibiotics (AGP, 50 mg/kg of carbadox), and direct fed microbials (DFM, 2.56 × 109  CFU/kg of B. subtilis). The experiment lasted 28 days with 7 days before and 21 days after first E. coli inoculation (day 0). Pigs in the PC, AGP, and DFM groups were orally inoculated with F18 ETEC for 3 consecutive days with 1010  CFU per dose per day. Fecal samples were collected on day -7, and day 7 and day 21 post inoculation, digesta samples were collected from jejunum, ileum, and distal colon on day 21 post inoculation to perform 16S rRNA sequencing. Sampling days and locations influenced (p < 0.05) Chao1 index and beta-diversity. Age increased (p  < 0.05) the relative abundance of Firmicutes but decreased (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in feces. ETEC infection increased (p  < 0.05) the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in feces on day 7 post inoculation. AGP reduced (p < 0.05) relative abundance of Firmicutes and Lactobacillaceae in feces compared with PC and DFM. AGP reduced (p < 0.05) relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae in jejunum and ileum, while DFM reduced (p < 0.05) relative abundance of Actinomycetaceae in jejunum and Lachnospiraceae in ileum, compared with PC. Pigs fed with DFM had greater (p < 0.05) relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae in jejunum, Lactobacillaceae in ileum and colon, and Bifidobacteriaceae in colon than pigs in AGP. Current results indicate that carbadox or B. subtilis had stronger influences on microbial diversity and composition in ileum than other intestinal segments and feces. Supplementation of B. subtilis could increase or maintain the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria in ileum compared with carbadox.",

This study assessed the genomic selection (GS) ability to predict alfalfa breeding values for drought-prone agricultural sites of Algeria, Morocco, and Argentina; managed-stress (MS) environments of Italy featuring moderate or intense drought; and one Tunisian site irrigated with moderately saline water. Additional aims were to investigate genotype × environment interaction (GEI) patterns and the effect on GS predictions of three single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling procedures, 12 statistical models that exclude or incorporate GEI, and allele dosage information. Our study included 127 genotypes from a Mediterranean reference population originated from three geographically contrasting populations, genotyped via genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotyped based on multi-year biomass dry matter yield of their dense-planted half-sib progenies. The GEI was very large, as shown by 27-fold greater additive genetic variance × environment interaction relative to the additive genetic variance and low genetic correlation for progeny yield responses across environments. The predictive ability of GS (using at least 37,969 SNP markers) exceeded 0.20 for moderate MS (representing Italian stress-prone sites) and the sites of Algeria and Argentina while being quite low for the Tunisian site and intense MS. Predictions of GS were complicated by rapid linkage disequilibrium decay. The weighted GBLUP model, GEI incorporation into GS models, and SNP calling based on a mock reference genome exhibited a predictive ability advantage for some environments. Our results support the specific breeding for each target region and suggest a positive role for GS in most regions when considering the challenges associated with phenotypic selection.",

        "abstract": "The expected move towards more sustainable crop-livestock systems implies wider cultivation of perennial forage legumes. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa subsp. sativa) is the main perennial legume in most temperate regions, especially where farm systems rely largely on forage conservation. White clover (Trifolium repens) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) are dominant in specific regions and farm systems. Although breeding progress for disease and insect resistance has been achieved, these crops have shown lower rates of genetic gain for yield than major grain crops, owing to lower breeding investment, longer selection cycles, impossibility to capitalize on harvest index, outbreeding mating systems associated with severe inbreeding depression, and high interaction of genotypes with cropping conditions and crop utilizations. Increasing yield, persistence, adaptation to stressful conditions (drought; salinity; grazing) and compatibility with companion grasses are major breeding targets. We expect genetic gain for yield and other complex traits to accelerate due to progress in genetic resource utilization, genomics resource development, integration of marker-assisted selection with breeding strategies, and trait engineering. The richness in adaptive genes of landraces and natural populations can be fully exploited through an ecological understanding of plant adaptive responses and improved breeding strategies. Useful genetic variation from secondary and tertiary gene pools of Medicago and Trifolium is being increasingly accessed. Genome sequencing projects in alfalfa and white clover will enrich physical, linkage and trait maps. Genome sequences will underpin fine mapping of useful loci and subsequent allele mining, leveraging the synteny of these crops with M. truncatula. Low-cost genome-wide markers generated through genotyping-by-sequencing will make genomic selection for adaptation and forage yield possible for these crops. Genetic markers will also be used for dissecting quantitative traits and developing toolboxes of functional markers for stress tolerance and other traits. Under current regulatory policies, transgenic approaches are likely to be limited to a few breakthrough traits. The key challenge for future applications of genomics technologies is their seamless integration with breeding system logistics and breeding schemes.",

        "abstract": "A large set of genome-wide markers and a high-throughput genotyping platform can facilitate the genetic dissection of complex traits and accelerate molecular breeding applications. Previously, we identified about 0.9 million SNP markers by sequencing transcriptomes of 27 diverse alfalfa genotypes. From this SNP set, we developed an Illumina Infinium array containing 9,277 SNPs. Using this array, we genotyped 280 diverse alfalfa genotypes and several genotypes from related species. About 81% (7,476) of the SNPs met the criteria for quality control and showed polymorphisms. The alfalfa SNP array also showed a high level of transferability for several closely related Medicago species. Principal component analysis and model-based clustering showed clear population structure corresponding to subspecies and ploidy levels. Within cultivated tetraploid alfalfa, genotypes from dormant and nondormant cultivars were largely assigned to different clusters; genotypes from semidormant cultivars were split between the groups. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across all genotypes rapidly decayed to 26 Kbp at r(2) = 0.2, but the rate varied across ploidy levels and subspecies. A high level of consistency in LD was found between and within the two subpopulations of cultivated dormant and nondormant alfalfa suggesting that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) could be conducted using alfalfa genotypes from throughout the fall dormancy spectrum. However, the relatively low LD levels would require a large number of markers to fully saturate the genome.",

        "abstract": "Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a native perennial warm season (C4) grass that has been identified as a promising species for bioenergy research and production. Consequently, biomass yield and feedstock quality improvements are high priorities for switchgrass research. The objective of this study was to develop a switchgrass genetic linkage map using a full-sib pseudo-testcross mapping population derived from a cross between two heterozygous genotypes selected from the lowland cultivar 'Alamo' (AP13) and the upland cultivar 'Summer' (VS16). The female parent (AP13) map consists of 515 loci in 18 linkage groups (LGs) and spans 1,733 cM. The male parent (VS16) map arranges 363 loci in 17 LGs and spans 1,508 cM. No obvious cause for the lack of one LG in VS16 could be identified. Comparative analyses between the AP13 and VS16 maps showed that the two major ecotypic classes of switchgrass have highly colinear maps with similar recombination rates, suggesting that chromosomal exchange between the two ecotypes should be able to occur freely. The AP13 and VS16 maps are also highly similar with respect to marker orders and recombination levels to previously published switchgrass maps. The genetic maps will be used to identify quantitative trait loci associated with biomass and quality traits. The AP13 genotype was used for the whole genome-sequencing project and the map will thus also provide a tool for the anchoring of the switchgrass genome assembly. © 2013 The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), a perennial and outcrossing species, is a widely planted forage legume for hay, pasture and silage throughout the world. Currently, alfalfa breeding relies on recurrent phenotypic selection, but alternatives incorporating molecular marker assisted breeding could enhance genetic gain per unit time and per unit cost, and accelerate alfalfa improvement. Many major quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to agronomic traits have been identified by family-based QTL mapping, but in relatively large genomic regions. Candidate genes elucidated from model species have helped to identify some potential causal loci in alfalfa mapping and breeding population for specific traits. Recently, high throughput sequencing technologies, coupled with advanced bioinformatics tools, have been used to identify large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in alfalfa, which are being developed into markers. These markers will facilitate fine mapping of quantitative traits and genome wide association mapping of agronomic traits and further advanced breeding strategies for alfalfa, such as marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Based on ideas from the literature, we suggest several ways to improve selection in alfalfa including (1) diversity selection and paternity testing, (2) introgression of QTL and (3) genomic selection.",

        "abstract": "We present Atos, a task-parallel GPU dynamic scheduling framework that is especially targeted at dynamic irregular applications. Compared to the dominant Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) frameworks, Atos exposes additional concurrency by supporting task-parallel formulations of applications with relaxed dependencies, achieving higher GPU utilization, which is particularly significant for problems with concurrency bottlenecks. Atos also offers implicit task-parallel load balancing in addition to data-parallel load balancing, providing users the flexibility to balance between them to achieve optimal performance. Finally, Atos allows users to adapt to different use cases by controlling the kernel strategy and task-parallel granularity. We demonstrate that each of these controls is important in practice. We evaluate and analyze the performance of Atos vs. BSP on three applications: breadth-first search, PageRank, and graph coloring. Atos implementations achieve geomean speedups of 3.44x, 2.1x, and 2.77x and peak speedups of 12.8x, 3.2x, and 9.08x across three case studies, compared to a state-of-the-art BSP GPU implementation. Beyond simply quantifying the speedup, we extensively analyze the reasons behind each speedup. This deeper understanding allows us to derive general guidelines for how to select the optimal Atos configuration for different applications. Finally, our analysis provides insights for future dynamic scheduling framework designs.",

Atos's lightweight GPU-to-GPU communication enables latency hiding and can smooth the interconnection usage for bisection-limited problems. These benefits are significant for dynamic, irregular applications that often involve fine-grained communication at unpredictable times and without predetermined patterns. Some principles for high performance: (1) do not involve the CPU in the communication control path; (2) allow GPU communication within kernels, addressing memory consistency directly rather than relying on synchronization with the CPU; (3) perform dynamic communication aggregation when interconnections have limited bandwidth. By lowering the overhead of communication and allowing it within GPU kernels, we support large, high-utilization GPU kernels but with more frequent communication. We evaluate Atos on two irregular problems: Breadth-First-Search and PageRank. Atos outperforms the state-of-the-art graph libraries Gunrock, Groute and Galois on both single-node-multi-GPU and multi-node-GPU settings.",

This makes it easier for programmers to exploit asynchrony, warp specialization, and hardware acceleration. Using Harmonic CUDA, we implement two example applications: Matrix Multiplication and GraphSage. The matrix multiplication kernel demonstrates how a key kernel can break down into more granular building blocks, with results that show a geomean average of 80% of cuBLAS performance, and up to 92% when omitting small matrices, as well as an analysis of how to improve performance in the future. GraphSage shows how asynchrony and warp specialization can provide significant performance improvements by reusing the same building blocks as the matrix multiplication kernel. We show performance improvements of 34% by changing to a warp-specialized version compared to a bulk-synchronous implementation. This paper evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of Harmonic CUDA based on these test cases and suggests future work to improve the programming model.",

With our open-source framework for load-balancing, we hope to improve programmers' productivity when developing irregular-parallel algorithms on the GPU, and also improve the overall performance characteristics for such applications by allowing a quick path to experimentation with a variety of existing load-balancing techniques. Consequently, we also hope that by separating the concerns of load-balancing from work processing within our abstraction, managing and extending existing code to future architectures becomes easier.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate safety of acupuncture treatment by Korean Medicine Doctors (KMDs), a prospective, practice-based survey on adverse events (AEs) associated with acupuncture was conducted. METHODS: From July 2016 to October 2017, KMDs were invited to participate in an online survey. Frequency was calculated as the number of AEs per 10,000 treatments; severity was assessed with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grading (Severity) Scale; and causality was evaluated using the World Health Organisation-Uppsala Monitoring Centre system for standardised case causality assessment. Associations between AE occurrence and KMDs' type of practice/clinical experience and patient age/gender/current medication(s) were analysed. RESULTS: Data on 37,490 acupuncture treatments were collected from 222 KMDs. At least one AE was reported from 4,518 acupuncture treatments, giving a frequency rate of 1,205 per 10,000 acupuncture treatments; this increased to 4,768 treatments when administrative problems related to defective devices or medical negligence were added, for a rate of 1,272 per 10,000 acupuncture treatments. Commonly reported AEs were bleeding, needle site pain, and bruising. Approximately 72.9% of AEs/administrative problems were assessed as they certainly occurred by acupuncture treatment in causality assessment. Most AEs/administrative problems were considered mild in severity and two life-threatening AEs were resolved with no sequelae. Compared to males, female patients were more likely to experience AEs and KMDs' clinical experience was not associated with reported AE occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Although acupuncture-associated AEs occur commonly, they are largely transient and mild. Acupuncture performed by qualified KMDs may serve as a reliable medical treatment with acceptable safety profiles.",

The performance of these equations in diverse potential living kidney donors requires study. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 637 potential living kidney donors from one tertiary hospital with serum creatinine concentration measurement and GFR measurement by iohexol plasma clearance between October 2016 and December 2020. EXPOSURE: Creatinine-based estimation of GFR by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (2009, CKDEPI09; 2021, CKDEPI21) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equations with and without inclusion of race coefficient, where applicable. OUTCOMES: Equation bias, precision, accuracy, and accurate classification of GFR as equal to and above or below 80 mL/min/1.73 m2. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: GFR estimation equation performance compared to measured GFR (mGFR) by iohexol clearance. RESULTS: The median bias of the CKDEPI21 equation underestimated mGFR by 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m2. The bias in the Black subgroup underestimated mGFR by 9.0 mL/min/1.73 m2. Compared to CKDEPI09 with and without race adjustment, the accuracy of CKDEPI21 increased across all subgroups. On average, 3.9% of individuals were misclassified by CKDEPI21 as having a GFR greater than, and 8.9% misclassified less than, 80 mL/min/1.73 m2, compared to 3.1% and 13.2% for CKDEPI09 with race adjustment, respectively. Total misclassification (either above or below 80 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 16.3% for CKDEPI21 and 16.0% for CKDEPI09 (with race adjustment). LIMITATIONS: Limited sample of individuals identifying as Black. Lack of cystatin C data. CONCLUSIONS: In our potential living donor sample, GFR estimation by creatinine-based CKDEPI21 is less biased and more accurate than previous creatinine-based estimated GFR equations. When evaluated by race, this summative improvement remains in individuals identifying as Asian, Hispanic, or White. More external validation is needed to assess whether the new equation is an improvement over the previous CKDEPI equation with a race coefficient.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fluoroscopy is the standard tool for transvenous implantation of traditional and leadless pacemakers (LPs). LPs are used to avoid complications of conventional pacemakers, but there still is a 6.5% risk of major complications. Mid-right ventricular (RV) septal device implantation is suggested to decrease the risk, but helpful cardiac landmarks cannot be visualized under fluoroscopy. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an alternative intraprocedural imaging method. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the spatial relationship of the LP to cardiac landmarks via TEE and their correlations with electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters, and to outline an intraprocedural method to confirm mid-RV nonapical lead positioning. METHODS: Fifty-six patients undergoing implantation of LP with TEE guidance were enrolled in the study. Device position was evaluated by fluoroscopy, ECG, and TEE. Distances between the device and cardiac landmarks were measured by TEE and analyzed with ECG parameters with and without RV pacing. RESULTS: Mid-RV septal positioning was achieved in all patients. TEE transgastric view (0°-40°/90°-130°) was the optimal view for visualizing device position. Mean tricuspid valve-LP distance was 4.9 ± 0.9 cm, mean pulmonary valve-LP distance was 4.2 ± 1 cm, and calculated RV apex-LP distance was 2.9 ± 1 cm. Mean LP paced QRS width was 160.8 ± 28 ms and increased from 117.2 ± 34 ms at baseline. LP RV pacing resulted in left bundle branch block pattern on ECG and 37.8% QRS widening by 43.5 ± 29 ms. CONCLUSION: TEE may guide LP implantation in the nonapical mid-RV position. Further studies are required to establish whether this technique reduces implant complications compared with conventional fluoroscopy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding (BF) provides optimal nutrition during the first 6 mo of life and is associated with reduced infant mortality and several health benefits for children and mothers. However, not all infants in the United States are breastfed, and sociodemographic disparities exist in BF rates. Experiencing more BF-friendly maternity care practices at the hospital is associated with better BF outcomes, but limited research has examined this association among mothers enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), a population at risk of low BF rates. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the association between BF-related hospital practices (rooming-in, support from hospital staff, and provision of a pro-formula gift pack) and the odds of any or exclusive BF through 5 mo among infants and mothers enrolled in WIC. METHODS: We analyzed data from the WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study II, a nationally representative cohort of children and caregivers enrolled in WIC. Exposures included maternal experience of hospital practices reported at 1 mo postpartum, and BF outcomes were surveyed at 1, 3, and 5 mo. ORs and 95% CIs were obtained using survey-weighted logistic regression, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Rooming-in and strong hospital staff support were associated with higher odds of any BF at 1, 3, and 5 mo postpartum. Provision of a pro-formula gift pack was negatively associated with any BF at all time points and with exclusive BF at 1 mo. Each additional BF-friendly hospital practice experienced was associated with 47% to 85% higher odds of any BF over the first 5 mo and 31% to 36% higher odds of exclusive BF over the first 3 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to BF-friendly hospital practices was associated with BF beyond the hospital stay. Expanding BF-friendly policies at the hospital could increase BF rates in the United States WIC-served population.",

It assigns category codes reflecting relative probability of HCC to imaging-detected liver observations based on major and ancillary imaging features. LI-RADS also includes imaging features suggesting malignancy other than HCC. Supported and endorsed by the American College of Radiology (ACR), the system has been developed by a committee of radiologists, hepatologists, pathologists, surgeons, lexicon experts, and ACR staff, with input from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing. Development of LI-RADS has been based on literature review, expert opinion, rounds of testing and iteration, and feedback from users. This article summarizes and assesses the quality of evidence supporting each LI-RADS major feature for diagnosis of HCC, as well as of the LI-RADS imaging features suggesting malignancy other than HCC.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe the appearance of chronically hemorrhagic adenomas on adrenal protocol CT and correlate imaging with pathologic findings. METHODS: Retrospective case series of adult patients with resected adrenal adenomas showing internal hemorrhage at histology. Seven of nine patients underwent pre-operative adrenal protocol CT and 2/7 underwent unenhanced CT with portal venous phase CT. Two abdominal radiologists in consensus assessed the CT images for the presence of calcifications, macroscopic fat, cystic/necrotic appearance, and the presence, pattern, and percent nodule volume of areas < 10 HU on unenhanced CT. Absolute washout was calculated using a large ROI, and ROIs on the highest and lowest attenuating regions on the portal venous phase. RESULTS: Mean adenoma length was 4.9 cm. All adenomas had areas measuring < 10 HU on unenhanced CT, ranging from < 20 to > 80% nodule volume. Calcifications were present in 4/9 adenomas and gross fat in 4/9 on CT. Of the seven cases with adrenal protocol CT, the absolute washout was < 60% in 5/7 using the large ROI, 5/7 using the low attenuation ROI, and 7/7 using the high attenuation ROI. At histology, all nine cases had microscopic evidence of hemorrhage, lipid rich adenoma cells, and fibrosclerosis. Myelolipomatous changes were identified in 4/9 cases, with the remaining five cases showing lipomatous metaplasia without a myeloid component. CONCLUSION: Chronically hemorrhagic adrenal adenomas demonstrated variable areas < 10 HU on unenhanced CT corresponding to lipid rich adenoma cells. Absolute washout was most often < 60%, hypothesized to be due to fibrosclerosis within the adenomas.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND. Homogeneous microscopic fat within adrenal nodules on chemical-shift MRI (CS-MRI) is diagnostic of benign adrenal adenoma, but the clinical relevance of heterogeneous microscopic fat is not well established. OBJECTIVE. This study sought to determine the prevalence of malignancy in adrenal nodules with heterogeneous microscopic fat on dual-echo T1-weighted CS-MRI. METHODS. We performed a retrospective study of adult patients with adrenal nodules detected on MRI performed between August 2007 and November 2020 at seven institutions. Eligible nodules had a short-axis diameter of 10 mm or larger with heterogeneous microscopic fat (defined by an area of signal loss of < 80% on opposed-phase CS-MRI). Two radiologists from each center, blinded to reference standard results, determined the signal loss pattern (diffuse, two distinct parts, speckling pattern, central loss, or peripheral loss) within the nodules. The reference standard used was available for 283 nodules (pathology for 21 nodules, ≥ 1 year of imaging follow-up for 245, and ≥ 5 years of clinical follow-up for 17) in 282 patients (171 women and 111 men; mean age, 60 ± 12 [SD] years); 30% (86/282) patients had prior malignancy. RESULTS. The mean long-axis diameter was 18.7 ± 7.9 mm (range, 10-80 mm). No malignant nodules were found in patients without prior cancer (0/197; 95% CI, 0-1.5%). Four of the 86 patients with prior malignancy (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], renal cell carcinoma [RCC], lung cancer, or both colon cancer and RCC) (4.7%; 95% CI, 1.3-11.5%) had metastatic nodules. Detected patterns were diffuse heterogeneous signal loss (40% [114/283]), speckling (28% [80/283]), two distinct parts (18% [51/283]), central loss (9% [26/283]), and peripheral loss (4% [12/283]). Two metastases from HCC and RCC showed diffuse heterogeneous signal loss. Lung cancer metastasis manifested as two distinct parts, and the metastasis in the patient with both colon cancer and RCC showed peripheral signal loss. CONCLUSION. Presence of heterogeneous microscopic fat in adrenal nodules on CS-MRI indicates a high likelihood of benignancy, particularly in patients without prior cancer. This finding is also commonly benign in patients with cancer; however, caution is warranted when primary malignancies may contain fat or if the morphologic pattern of signal loss may indicate a collision tumor. CLINICAL IMPACT. In the absence of prior cancer, adrenal nodules with heterogeneous microscopic fat do not require additional imaging evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Background Various limitations have impacted research evaluating reader agreement for Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS). Purpose To assess reader agreement of LI-RADS in an international multicenter multireader setting using scrollable images. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used deidentified clinical multiphase CT and MRI and reports with at least one untreated observation from six institutions and three countries; only qualifying examinations were submitted. Examination dates were October 2017 to August 2018 at the coordinating center. One untreated observation per examination was randomly selected using observation identifiers, and its clinically assigned features were extracted from the report. The corresponding LI-RADS version 2018 category was computed as a rescored clinical read. Each examination was randomly assigned to two of 43 research readers who independently scored the observation. Agreement for an ordinal modified four-category LI-RADS scale (LR-1, definitely benign; LR-2, probably benign; LR-3, intermediate probability of malignancy; LR-4, probably hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]; LR-5, definitely HCC; LR-M, probably malignant but not HCC specific; and LR-TIV, tumor in vein) was computed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Agreement was also computed for dichotomized malignancy (LR-4, LR-5, LR-M, and LR-TIV), LR-5, and LR-M. Agreement was compared between research-versus-research reads and research-versus-clinical reads. Results The study population consisted of 484 patients (mean age, 62 years ± 10 [SD]; 156 women; 93 CT examinations, 391 MRI examinations). ICCs for ordinal LI-RADS, dichotomized malignancy, LR-5, and LR-M were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.73), 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.70), 0.58 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.66), and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.61) respectively. Research-versus-research reader agreement was higher than research-versus-clinical agreement for modified four-category LI-RADS (ICC, 0.68 vs 0.62, respectively; P = .03) and for dichotomized malignancy (ICC, 0.63 vs 0.53, respectively; P = .005), but not for LR-5 (P = .14) or LR-M (P = .94). Conclusion There was moderate agreement for LI-RADS version 2018 overall. For some comparisons, research-versus-research reader agreement was higher than research-versus-clinical reader agreement, indicating differences between the clinical and research environments that warrant further study. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

This is due to the confirmation bias especially when the pseudo labels are highly biased towards the majority classes. Traditional resampling or reweighting techniques may not be directly applicable when the unlabeled data distribution is unknown. Inspired by the threshold-moving method that performs well in supervised learning-based binary classification tasks, we provide a simple yet effective scheme to address the multiclass imbalance issue of SSL. This scheme, named SaR, is a Self-adaptive Refinement of soft labels before generating pseudo labels. The pseudo labels generated post-SaR will be less biased, resulting in higher quality data for training the classifier. We show that SaR can consistently improve recent consistency-based SSL algorithms on various image classification problems across different imbalanced ratios. We also show that SaR is robust to the situations where unlabeled data have different distributions as labeled data. Hence, SaR does not rely on the assumptions that unlabeled data share the same distribution as the labeled data.",

The efforts on how to construct a robust SSL framework that can effectively learn from datasets with unknown distributions remain limited. We first investigate the feasibility of adding weights to the consistency loss and then we verify the necessity of smoothed weighting schemes. Based on this study, we propose a self-adaptive algorithm, named Smoothed Adaptive Weighting (SAW). SAW is designed to enhance the robustness of SSL by estimating the learning difficulty of each class and synthesizing the weights in the consistency loss based on such estimation. We show that SAW can complement recent consistency-based SSL algorithms and improve their reliability on various datasets including three standard datasets and one gigapixel medical imaging application without making any assumptions about the distribution of the unlabeled set.",

However, typical DP mechanisms add noise to the training process and can lead to various convergence problems. We propose HE-GAN, a DP generative framework that eliminates noise addition by using Exponential Mechanism (EM) on the privacy-factor-adjusted posterior predictive distribution of a classifier trained on the private data. EM is more general than many other DP mechanisms including Laplacian and Gaussian mechanisms. EM's reliance on sampling the output space also prevents the DP noise from corrupting the training process. However, there are two challenges: first, sampling the posterior distribution of the private discriminative classifier may not be able to produce high-quality synthetic samples. Instead, we sample from the latent space of a publicly-trained GAN to optimize the private posterior. Second, we use the highly effective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method for latent space sampling. We perform experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST under public-private splits. Results show that HE-GAN can achieve downstream classification accuracy on par with or better than state-of-the-art scheme over a wide range of privacy budgets.",

Our approach involves mapping private data to the latent space using a public generator, followed by a lower-dimensional DP-GAN with better convergence properties. We evaluate the performance of DPGOMI on standard datasets CIFAR10 and SVHN, as well as on a facial landmark dataset for Autism screening. Our results show that DPGOMI outperforms the standard DP-GAN method in terms of Inception Score, Fréchet Inception Distance, and classification performance, while providing the same level of privacy. Our proposed approach offers a promising solution for protecting sensitive data in GAN training while maintaining high-quality results.",

Glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate/paraquat-resistant (GPR) biotypes challenge current management strategies. These GR and GPR biotypes have non-Target site resistance, which can confer resistance to herbicides with different sites of action (SOAs). This study's objective was to characterize the response of GR, GPR, and glyphosate/paraquat-susceptible (GPS) biotypes of both weed species to herbicides with a different SOA. Whole-plant dose-response bioassays indicated a similar response among tested biotypes of both weed species to rimsulfuron, dicamba, hexazinone, glufosinate, flumioxazin, saflufenacil, or mesotrione. The hairy fleabane GR and GPR biotypes were 2.7-and 2.9-fold resistant to 2,4-D relative to the GPS biotype (GR50 766.7 g ai ha-1), confirming 2,4-D resistance in hairy fleabane for the first time in California. The GR and GPR biotypes were not cross-resistant to dicamba. No differences in response to 2,4-D were observed among horseweed biotypes with a GR50 ranging from 150.2 to 277.4 g ai ha-1. The GPR biotypes of both species were cross-resistant to diquat, with a 44.0-fold resistance in hairy fleabane (GR50 863.7 g ai ha-1) and 15.6-fold resistance in horseweed (GR50 563.1 g ai ha-1). The confirmation of multiple resistances to glyphosate, paraquat, and 2,4-D in hairy fleabane curtails herbicide SOA alternatives and jeopardizes resistance management strategies based on herbicide rotation and tank mixtures, underscoring the critical need for nonchemical weed control alternatives.",

        "abstract": "Herbicides are the most commonly used means of controlling weeds. Recently, there has been growing concern over the potential impacts of global climate change, specifically, increasing temperatures and elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, on the sensitivity of weeds to herbicides. Here, glyphosate response of both Conyza canadensis and Chenopodium album was evaluated under different environmental conditions. Reduced glyphosate sensitivity was observed in both species in response to increased temperature, elevated CO2 level, and the combination of both factors. Increased temperature had greater effect on plant survival than elevated CO2 level. In combination, high temperature and elevated CO2 level resulted in loss of apical dominance and rapid necrosis in glyphosate-treated plants. To investigate the mechanistic basis of reduced glyphosate sensitivity, translocation was examined using 14C-glyphosate. In plants that were subjected to high temperatures and elevated CO2 level, glyphosate was more rapidly translocated out of the treated leaf to shoot meristems and roots than in plants grown under control conditions. These results suggest that altered glyphosate translocation and tissue-specific sequestration may be the basis of reduced plant sensitivity. Therefore, overreliance on glyphosate for weed control under changing climatic conditions may result in more weed control failures.",

        "abstract": "Poplar trees (Populus spp.) are often used in bioremediation strategies because of their ability to phytoextract potential toxic ions, e.g., selenium (Se) from poor quality soils. Soil microorganisms may play a vital role in sustaining health of soil and/or tolerance of these trees grown in poor quality soils by contributing to nutrient cycling, soil structure, overall soil quality, and plant survival. The effect of naturally occurring salts boron (B) and Se on soil microbial community composition associated with poplar trees is not known for bioremediation strategies. In this study, three Populus clones 13-366, 345-1, and 347-14 were grown in spring 2006 under highly saline, B, and Se clay-like soils in the west side of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of CA, as well as in non-saline sandy loam soils located in the east side of the SJV. After 7 years of growing in the respective soils of different qualities, soil samples were collected from poplar clones grown in saline and non-saline soils to examine and compare soil quality effects on soil microbial community biomass and composition. The phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to characterize microbial community composition in soils from trees grown at both locations. This study showed that microbial biomass and the amount and proportion of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community were lower in all three poplar clones grown in saline soil compared to non-saline soil. Amounts of Gram + bacterial and actinomycetes PLFAs were significantly lower in poplar clone 13-366 grown in saline soil compared to non-saline soil; however, they did not differ significantly in poplar clones 347-14 and 345-1. Additionally, amounts of saprophytic fungal, Gram - bacterial and eukaryotic PLFA remained similar at saline and non-saline sites under poplar clones 347-14, 345-1, and 13-366. Therefore, this study suggested that salinity and B do have an impact on microbial biomass and AMF; however, these poplar clones still recycled sufficient amount of nutrients to support and protect saprophytic fungal and bacterial communities from the effects of poor quality soils.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary studies of species coexistence are underpinned by deterministic models that assume that competing species have continuous (i.e., noninteger) densities, live in infinitely large landscapes, and coexist over infinite time horizons. By contrast, in nature, species are composed of discrete individuals subject to demographic stochasticity and occur in habitats of finite size where extinctions occur in finite time. One consequence of these discrepancies is that metrics of species' coexistence derived from deterministic theory may be unreliable predictors of the duration of species coexistence in nature. These coexistence metrics include invasion growth rates and niche and fitness differences, which are now commonly applied in theoretical and empirical studies of species coexistence. In this study, we tested the efficacy of deterministic coexistence metrics on the duration of species coexistence in a finite world. We introduce new theoretical and computational methods to estimate coexistence times in stochastic counterparts of classic deterministic models of competition. Importantly, we parameterized this model using experimental field data for 90 pairwise combinations of 18 species of annual plants, allowing us to derive biologically informed estimates of coexistence times for a natural system. Strikingly, we found that for species expected to deterministically coexist, community sizes containing only 10 individuals had predicted coexistence times of more than 1000 years. We also found that invasion growth rates explained 60% of the variation in intrinsic coexistence times, reinforcing their general usefulness in studies of coexistence. However, only by integrating information on both invasion growth rates and species' equilibrium population sizes could most (>99%) of the variation in species coexistence times be explained. This integration was achieved with demographically uncoupled single-species models solely determined by the invasion growth rates and equilibrium population sizes. Moreover, because of a complex relationship between niche overlap/fitness differences and equilibrium population sizes, increasing niche overlap and increasing fitness differences did not always result in decreasing coexistence times, as deterministic theory would predict. Nevertheless, our results tend to support the informed use of deterministic theory for understanding the duration of species' coexistence while highlighting the need to incorporate information on species' equilibrium population sizes in addition to invasion growth rates.",

        "abstract": "To understand the mechanisms underlying species coexistence, ecologists often study invasion growth rates of theoretical and data-driven models. These growth rates correspond to average per-capita growth rates of one species with respect to an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological literature, coexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive. Intuitively, positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from being rare. To provide a mathematically rigorous framework for this approach, we prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the signs of the invasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient, which invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic models and equate coexistence with permanence, i.e., a global attractor bounded away from extinction. For models satisfying certain technical assumptions, we introduce invasion graphs where vertices correspond to proper subsets of species (communities) supporting an ergodic measure and directed edges correspond to potential transitions between communities due to invasions by missing species. These directed edges are determined by the signs of invasion growth rates. When the invasion graph is acyclic (i.e. there is no sequence of invasions starting and ending at the same community), we show that permanence is determined by the signs of the invasion growth rates. In this case, permanence is characterized by the invasibility of all [Formula: see text] communities, i.e., communities without species i where all other missing species have negative invasion growth rates. To illustrate the applicability of the results, we show that dissipative Lotka-Volterra models generically satisfy our technical assumptions and computing their invasion graphs reduces to solving systems of linear equations. We also apply our results to models of competing species with pulsed resources or sharing a predator that exhibits switching behavior. Open problems for both deterministic and stochastic models are discussed. Our results highlight the importance of using concepts about community assembly to study coexistence.",

        "abstract": "Sexual dimorphism is a ubiquitous source of within-species variation, yet the community-level consequences of sex differences remain poorly understood. Here, we analyse a bitrophic model of two competing resource species and a sexually reproducing consumer species. We show that consumer sex differences in resource acquisition can have striking consequences for consumer-resource coexistence, abundance and dynamics. Under both direct interspecific competition and apparent competition between two resource species, sexual dimorphism in consumers' attack rates can mediate coexistence of the resource species, while in other cases can lead to exclusion when stable coexistence is typically expected. Slight sex differences in total resource acquisition also can reverse competitive outcomes and lead to density cycles. These effects are expected whenever both consumer sexes require different amounts or types of resources to reproduce. Our results suggest that consumer sexual dimorphism, which is common, has wide-reaching implications for the assembly and dynamics of natural communities.",

        "abstract": "AbstractRapid environmental change is affecting many organisms; some are coping well, but many species are in decline. A key mechanism for facilitating success following environmental change is phenotypic plasticity. Organisms use cues to respond phenotypically to environmental conditions; many incorporate recent information (within-generation plasticity) and information from previous generations (transgenerational plasticity). We extend an existing evolutionary model where organisms utilize within-generational plasticity, transgenerational plasticity, and bet hedging to include changes in environmental regime. We show how when rapid evolution of plasticity is not possible, the effect of environmental change (altering the environment mean, variance, or autocorrelation or cue reliability) on population growth rate depends on the population's evolutionary history and past evolutionary responses to historical environmental conditions. We then evaluate the predictions that populations adapted to highly variable environments or with greater within-generational plasticity are more likely to successfully respond to environmental change. We identify when these predictions fail and show that environmental change is most detrimental when previously reliable cues become unreliable. When multiple cues become unreliable, environmental change can cause deleterious effects regardless of the population's evolutionary history. Overall, this work provides a general framework for understanding the role of plasticity in population responses to rapid environmental change.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSpecies interact in landscapes where environmental conditions vary in time and space. This variability impacts how species select habitat patches. Under equilibrium conditions, evolution of this patch selection can result in ideal free distributions where per capita growth rates are zero in occupied patches and negative in unoccupied patches. These ideal free distributions, however, do not explain why species occupy sink patches, why competitors have overlapping spatial ranges, or why predators avoid highly productive patches. To understand these patterns, we solve for coevolutionarily stable strategies (coESSs) of patch selection for multispecies stochastic Lotka-Volterra models accounting for spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In occupied patches at the coESS, we show that the differences between the local contributions to the mean and the variance of the long-term population growth rate are equalized. Applying this characterization to models of antagonistic interactions reveals that environmental stochasticity can partially exorcize the ghost of competition past, select for new forms of enemy-free and victimless space, and generate hydra effects over evolutionary timescales. Viewing our results through the economic lens of modern portfolio theory highlights why the coESS for patch selection is often a bet-hedging strategy coupling stochastic sink populations. Our results highlight how environmental stochasticity can reverse or amplify evolutionary outcomes as a result of species interactions or spatial heterogeneity.",

        "abstract": "Targeted deletion of the bZIP transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta), was shown previously to result in aberrant ductal morphogenesis and decreased lobuloalveolar development, accompanied by an altered pattern of progesterone receptor (PR) expression. Here, similar changes in the level and pattern of prolactin receptor (PrlR) expression were observed while screening for differentially expressed genes in C/EBPbeta(null) mice. PR patterning was also altered in PrlR(null) mice, as well as in mammary tissue transplants from both PrlR(null) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 5a/b-deficient mice, with concomitant defects in hormone-induced proliferation. Down-regulation of PR and activation of Stat5 phosphorylation were seen after estrogen and progesterone treatment in both C/EBPbeta(null) and wild-type mice, indicating that these signaling pathways were functional, despite the failure of steroid hormones to induce proliferation. IGF binding protein-5, IGF-II, and insulin receptor substrate-1 all displayed altered patterns and levels of expression in C/EBPbeta(null) mice, suggestive of a change in the IGF signaling axis. In addition, small proline-rich protein (SPRR2A), a marker of epidermal differentiation, and keratin 6 were misexpressed in the mammary epithelium of C/EBPbeta(null) mice. Together, these data suggest that C/EBPbeta is a master regulator of mammary epithelial cell fate and that the correct spatial pattern of PR and PrlR expression is a critical determinant of hormone-regulated cell proliferation.",

        "abstract": "The causal relationship between atrazine exposure and the occurrence of breast cancer in women was evaluated using the framework developed by Adami et al. (2011) wherein biological plausibility and epidemiological evidence were combined to conclude that a causal relationship between atrazine exposure and breast cancer is \"unlikely\". Carcinogenicity studies in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) but not Fischer-344 rats indicate that high doses of atrazine caused a decreased latency and an increased incidence of combined adenocarcinoma and fibroadenoma mammary tumors. There were no effects of atrazine on any other tumor type in male or female SD or Fischer-344 rats or in three strains of mice. Seven key events that precede tumor expression in female SD rats were identified. Atrazine induces mammary tumors in aging female SD rats by suppressing the luteinizing hormone surge, thereby supporting a state of persistent estrus and prolonged exposure to endogenous estrogen and prolactin. This endocrine mode of action has low biological plausibility for women because women who undergo reproductive senescence have low rather than elevated levels of estrogen and prolactin. Four alternative modes of action (genotoxicity, estrogenicity, upregulation of aromatase gene expression or delayed mammary gland development) were considered and none could account for the tumor response in SD rats. Epidemiological studies provide no support for a causal relationship between atrazine exposure and breast cancer. This conclusion is consistent with International Agency for Research on Cancer's classification of atrazine as \"unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity\" and the United States Environmental Protection Agency's classification of atrazine as \"not likely to be carcinogenic.\"",

        "abstract": "Sertoli cell proliferation is prolonged in neonatal boars treated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, but porcine testicular aromatase synthesizes a potent, non-aromatizable androgen, 1-hydroxytestosterone, as well as estradiol. Therefore, experiments were conducted to determine whether the Sertoli cell proliferative response to letrozole is due to a loss of estrogen or a loss of androgen signaling. Littermate boars were treated with letrozole, the estrogen receptor blocker ICI 182,780, or vehicle, from 1 week of age and testes collected at 6.5 weeks. Sertoli cell number was increased 30% by letrozole or ICI 182,780 compared with vehicle. Neither treatment affected testosterone, gonadotropins or prolactin. We conclude that Sertoli cell proliferation in neonatal boars is restricted by the local activation of estrogen receptors. The response to letrozole is apparently not mediated by the novel capacity of the porcine gonadal aromatase for 1-hydroxytestosterone but by estradiol synthesis; therefore, aromatase inhibition may have similar effects on Sertoli cell proliferation in other species.",

        "abstract": "The mammary gland can no longer be simply viewed as an organ composed of epithelial cells within a passive stromal microenvironment. Many lines of evidence have evolved to reinforce the notion that mammary epithelial cell growth, differentiation, lactation and progression to cancer involves bidirectional interactions between the epithelial population and its surrounding stroma. Within this stroma are numerous systems that are all capable of modulating epithelial function. In this context, the mammary stroma is not simply a depot of adipose tissue in which mammary epithelial cells undertake a unique growth and differentiation process, although adipocytes can impart numerous modulatory signals to epithelial cells, and vice versa. Rather, the stromal environment constitutes and supports a critical vasculature that supplies nutrients and endocrine cues, a lymphatic system that not only removes metabolites but also provides an intimate interface with the immune system, and an extracellular matrix scaffold in which epithelial cells grow, differentiate and regress. Ultimately all of these components play a critical role in directing the epithelial phenotype during normal mammary gland growth and function. An increasing appreciation for these different systems demands a view of mammary epithelial cells in a much different light, and further necessitates the development of model systems that incorporate and integrate increasing complexity.",

        "abstract": "Prolactin (PRL) is required not only for maintenance of gestation in pigs but also for mammary gland development and subsequent lactogenesis. The actions of PRL are modulated by both long and short isoforms of the PRL receptor (PRLR), where short isoforms can interfere with the essential signaling function of the long isoform. Using 3' RACE we have isolated a unique splice variant of the porcine PRLR (pPRLR) that contains a short intracellular domain of 38 aa that is encoded by splicing from exon 9 to a novel exon 11 located 17.5 kb downstream of exon 10 on chromosome 16. The short pPRLR was detected as a 42 kDa protein in membranes from porcine mammary glands. Functional analyses indicated that the short pPRLR functions as a dominant negative against the differentiative function of the long pPRLR and does not transduce a signal to the rat β-casein promoter. Differential abundance of long pPRLR and short pPRLR mRNA was established in a range of porcine tissues. The binding affinity of the short pPRLR for pPRL was lower (K(d) = 3.7 nM) than the affinity of the long pPRLR (K(d) = 1.6 nM) despite a fourfold higher level of binding sites for the short pPRLR. Our data raise the possibility that the short pPRLR in pigs may function independently from the long pPRLR, where the splicing strategy used to generate the short pPRLR likely evolved under different selection pressures to those acting on the long pPRLR.",

This study characterized the association of phenotypic and genotypic AMR, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production, and virulence genes isolated from waterborne Escherichia coli (E. coli) (n = 84), Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) subsp. enterica (n = 12), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) (n = 249), and Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) (n = 39) from Thailand's coastal aquaculture regions. All Salmonella (100.0%) and half of V. cholerae (51.3%) isolates harbored their unique virulence gene, invA and ompW, respectively. The majority of isolates of V. parahaemolyticus and E. coli, ~25% of S. enterica subsp. enterica, and ~12% of V. cholerae, exhibited phenotypic AMR to multiple antimicrobials, with 8.9% of all coastal water isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). Taken together, we recommend that coastal water quality surveillance programs include monitoring for bacterial AMR for food safety and recreational water exposure to water for Thailand's coastal water resources.",

To determine the prevalence of Salmonella in pistachios, a total of 3,966 samples (1,032 floaters and 2,934 sinkers) were collected within 4 months of the 2010, 2011, and 2012 harvests from storage silos (12 samples from each silo, in most cases) and were stored at 4°C; 100-g subsamples were enriched for the presence of Salmonella. Twenty-one of the floater samples and 11 of the sinker samples were positive for Salmonella: 2.0% prevalence (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 3.1%) and 0.37% prevalence (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.67%), respectively, for a weighted average prevalence of 0.61%. Levels of Salmonella were determined for positive samples using a most-probable-number (MPN) method with multiple 50-g, three 5.6-g, and three 0.56-g subsamples. Geometric mean levels of Salmonella in floaters and sinkers were 0.66 MPN/100 g (0.14 to 5.3 MPN/100 g) and 0.18 MPN/100 g (0.10 to 0.62 MPN/100 g), respectively. Seven different serovars were identified among the isolates, with nine pulsed-field gel electrophoresis fingerprints; as many as four serovars were isolated from some samples. Salmonella serovars Montevideo (44%), Enteritidis (19%), Senftenberg (16%), Worthington (12%), and Liverpool (9.4%) were most commonly isolated from the initial 100-g samples. The prevalence and levels of Salmonella in pistachios are within those observed for other tree nuts, but the limited number of serovars isolated suggests a narrow and persistent contamination source.",

        "abstract": "In social animals, group living may impact the risk of infectious disease acquisition in two ways. On the one hand, social connectedness puts individuals at greater risk or susceptibility for acquiring enteric pathogens via contact-mediated transmission. Yet conversely, in strongly bonded societies like humans and some nonhuman primates, having close connections and strong social ties of support can also socially buffer individuals against susceptibility or transmissibility of infectious agents. Using social network analyses, we assessed the potentially competing roles of contact-mediated transmission and social buffering on the risk of infection from an enteric bacterial pathogen (Shigella flexneri) among captive groups of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Our results indicate that, within two macaque groups, individuals possessing more direct and especially indirect connections in their grooming and huddling social networks were less susceptible to infection. These results are in sharp contrast to several previous studies that indicate that increased (direct) contact-mediated transmission facilitates infectious disease transmission, including our own findings in a third macaque group in which individuals central in their huddling network and/or which initiated more fights were more likely to be infected. In summary, our findings reveal that an individual's social connections may increase or decrease its chances of acquiring infectious agents. They extend the applicability of the social buffering hypothesis, beyond just stress and immune-function-related health benefits, to the additional health outcome of infectious disease resistance. Finally, we speculate that the circumstances under which social buffering versus contact-mediated transmission may occur could depend on multiple factors, such as living condition, pathogen-specific transmission routes, and/or an overall social context such as a group's social stability.",

        "abstract": "In group-living animals, heterogeneity in individuals' social connections may mediate the sharing of microbial infectious agents. In this regard, the genetic relatedness of individuals' commensal gut bacterium Escherichia coli may be ideal to assess the potential for pathogen transmission through animal social networks. Here we use microbial phylogenetics and population genetics approaches, as well as host social network reconstruction, to assess evidence for the contact-mediated sharing of E. coli among three groups of captively housed rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), at multiple organizational scales. For each group, behavioral data on grooming, huddling, and aggressive interactions collected for a six-week period were used to reconstruct social network communities via the Data Cloud Geometry (DCG) clustering algorithm. Further, an E. coli isolate was biochemically confirmed and genotypically fingerprinted from fecal swabs collected from each macaque. Population genetics approaches revealed that Group Membership, in comparison to intrinsic attributes like age, sex, and/or matriline membership of individuals, accounted for the highest proportion of variance in E. coli genotypic similarity. Social network approaches revealed that such sharing was evident at the community-level rather than the dyadic level. Specifically, although we found no links between dyadic E. coli similarity and social contact frequencies, similarity was significantly greater among macaques within the same social network communities compared to those across different communities. Moreover, tests for one of our study-groups confirmed that E. coli isolated from macaque rectal swabs were more genotypically similar to each other than they were to isolates from environmentally deposited feces. In summary, our results suggest that among frequently interacting, spatially constrained macaques with complex social relationships, microbial sharing via fecal-oral, social contact-mediated routes may depend on both individuals' direct connections and on secondary network pathways that define community structure. They lend support to the hypothesis that social network communities may act as bottlenecks to contain the spread of infectious agents, thereby encouraging disease control strategies to focus on multiple organizational scales. Future directions includeincreasing microbial sampling effort per individual to better-detect dyadic transmission events, and assessments of the co-evolutionary links between sociality, infectious agent risk, and host immune function.",

Specifically, the relative effects of human-wildlife and wildlife-wildlife interactions on disease outbreaks among wildlife populations in urban and peri-urban environments remain unclear. We used social network analysis and epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models to simulate zooanthroponotic outbreaks, through wild animals' joint propensities to co-interact with humans, and their social grooming of conspecifics. On 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.) in peri-urban environments in Asia, we collected behavioral data using event sampling of human-macaque interactions within the same time and space, and focal sampling of macaques' social interactions with conspecifics and overall anthropogenic exposure. Model-predicted outbreak sizes were related to structural features of macaques' networks. For all three species, and for both anthropogenic (co-interactions) and social (grooming) contexts, outbreak sizes were positively correlated to the network centrality of first-infected macaques. Across host species and contexts, the above effects were stronger through macaques' human co-interaction networks than through their grooming networks, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques. Long-tailed macaques appeared to show intraspecific variation in these effects. Our findings suggest that among wildlife in anthropogenically-impacted environments, the structure of their aggregations around anthropogenic factors makes them more vulnerable to zooanthroponotic outbreaks than their social structure. The global features of these networks that influence disease outbreaks, and their underlying socio-ecological covariates, need further investigation. Animals that consistently interact with both humans and their conspecifics are important targets for disease control.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are a growing number of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for autistic individuals, but few are successfully implemented with fidelity in under-resourced communities and with families from traditionally disenfranchised groups. Implementation science offers tools to increase EBI use in communities, but most implementation strategies are designed specific to a single EBI. It is not feasible to develop a new implementation strategy each time a new EBI is introduced in the community. Therefore, to test the effectiveness and generalizability of implementation strategies we are developing and testing a multifaceted implementation strategy with three EBIs concurrently. The goal of this protocol paper is to describe the randomized field trial of an implementation strategy for use across autism EBIs, diverse settings and participants, with the goal of increasing rapid uptake of effective practices to reach our most vulnerable children. METHODS: We developed a multifaceted implementation strategy called Using Novel Implementation Tools for Evidence-based intervention Delivery (UNITED) to facilitate the implementation and sustainment of three EBIs in under-resourced settings. We will compare fidelity to, and effectiveness of, each intervention [Mind the Gap (MTG), Remaking Recess (RR), Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI)] with and without UNITED in a randomized field trial. Randomization will be stratified using a minimization allocation method. We will train community practitioners using remote delivery of modules specific to the intervention, and active coaching via Zoom for at least 6 sessions and up to 12 as dictated by each EBI. Our primary outcome is fidelity to each EBI, and our secondary outcome is at the child or family level (family empowerment for MTG, child peer social engagement for RR, and adolescent self-determination for SDLMI, respectively). We will measure progress through the implementation phases using the Stages of Implementation Completion and cost-effectiveness of UNITED. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide rigorous data on the effectiveness and generalizability of one relatively light-touch implementation strategy in increasing use of autism EBIs and associated outcomes in diverse under resourced public service settings for underrepresented autistic youth.

        "abstract": "Early Intervention systems provide therapeutic services to families of young children birth to 3 years with developmental delays and are considered a natural access point to services for young children and their families. Research studies in the autism field have been interested in training providers to deliver evidence-based practices in Early Intervention systems to increase access to services for young children with an increased likelihood of being autistic. However, research has often overlooked that Early Intervention systems prioritize family-centered care, an approach to working with families that honors and respects their values and choices and that provides supports to strengthen family functioning. This commentary points out that family-centered care deserves greater attention in research being done in Early Intervention systems. We describe how family-centered care may shape how interventions are delivered, and discuss directions for future research to evaluate the impact of family-centered care alongside intervention delivery.",

        "abstract": "Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching (CPRT) is a community-partnered adaptation of a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention identified as an evidence-based practice for autistic children. The current study evaluated student outcomes in a randomized, wait-list controlled implementation trial across classrooms. Participants included teachers (n = 126) and students with autism (n = 308). Teachers participated in 12 hours of didactic, interactive training and additional in-classroom coaching. Generalized Estimating Equations accounted for clustering. Adjusted models evaluated the relative effects of training group, CPRT fidelity, and classroom quality on student outcomes. Results indicate higher CPRT fidelity was associated with greater increases in student learning. Having received CPRT training predicted increased student engagement and greater decreases in reported approach/withdrawal problems. These differences may be linked to the theoretical foundations of CPRT of increasing student motivation and engagement and collaborative adaptation to increase feasibility in schools. Overall, results suggest CPRT may be a beneficial approach for supporting autistic students.",

This study identifies perceived variables linked to effective statewide scale-up of EBPs in special education by exploring implementation climate and leadership across special education organization types (e.g., schools, districts, and regional consortiums). A simultaneous QUAL + QUAN mixed methods design was employed with the primary function of convergence and triangulation. Data included focus groups with 30 special educators and a statewide survey completed by 656 school personnel. In general, perceptions of implementation climate and leadership are weak in special education organizations with strengths at regional levels focused on special education and increased challenges at the school and district levels. Implications for practice and future research are identified.",

However, discerning the underlying mechanistic pathways has proved to be challenging. Using data from 506 mother-child dyads from the prospective longitudinal birth-cohort of the INMA—INfancia y Medio Ambiente—(Environment and Childhood) Project, this study aimed to test how maternal SES influences early cognitive development, examining potential mediating factors, including maternal mental health, family context, and first nursery school attendance. Results indicate that the association of maternal mental health and SES on early cognitive development is fully mediated by the quality of the family context. Nursery attendance early in life also had a full mediation effect on maternal SES. These findings suggest that epidemiological studies should consider more than SES variables when studying environmental influences on early cognitive development. Policy implications are discussed in the current context of a global likelihood of economic crises and mental health challenges.",

Photons from identified stretched E2 collective transitions in even-even fission product nuclei are particularly suitable because they do not affect the orientation of the nuclear spin. Their angular distribution relative to the direction of a fission fragment may reveal the orientation of the fragment spins relative to the fission axis. A novel means of probing the correlated fission fragment spins is the distribution of the opening angle between E2 photons from even-even partner fragments which reveals the mutual correlation of the fragment spins, if the photon helicities can be determined, demonstrating the potential power of helicity measurements in fission.",

        "abstract": "We differentiate the event-by-event n-γ multiplicity data from Cf252(sf) with respect to the energies of the emitted particles as well as their relative angles of emission. We determine that neutron emission enhances γ-ray emission around 0.7 and 1.2 MeV, but the only directional alignment was observed for Eγ≤0.7 MeV and tended to be parallel and antiparallel to neutrons emitted in the same event. The emission of γ rays at other energies was determined to be nearly isotropic. The presence of the emission and alignment enhancements is explained by positive correlations between neutron emission and quadrupole γ-ray emission along rotational bands in the de-exciting fragments. This observation corroborates the hypothesis of positive correlations between the angular momentum of a fragment and its intrinsic excitation energy. The results of this work are especially relevant in view of the recent theoretical and experimental interest in the generation of angular momentum in fission. Specifically, we have determined an alignment of the fragment's angular momenta in a direction perpendicular to the direction of motion. We interpret the lack of n-γ angular correlations for fission fragments near closed shells as a weakening of the alignment process for spherical nuclei. Lastly, we have observed that statistical γ rays are emitted isotropically, indicating that the average angular momentum removed by this radiation is small. These results, and the analysis tools presented in this work, represent a stepping stone for future analysis of n-γ emission correlations and their connection to angular momentum properties.",

Similar nuclear data needs are shared by many applications, thus prioritizing these needs is especially important and urgently needed. Many levels of analysis are required to prepare nuclear measurements for employment in end-user applications.

        "abstract": "The emission of neutrons and γ rays by fission fragments reveal important information about the properties of fragments immediately following scission. The initial fragment properties, correlations between fragments, and emission competition give rise to correlations in neutron-γ emission. Recent theoretical and experimental advances have been proposed to explain the mechanism of angular momentum generation in fission, which would result in observable signature in neutron-γ emission correlations. In this paper, we present a novel analysis method of neutrons and γ rays emitted by fission fragments that allows us to discern structure in the observed correlations. We have analyzed data collected on Cf252(sf) at the Chi-Nu array at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. Through our analysis of the energy-differential neutron-γ multiplicity covariance, we have observed enhanced neutron-γ correlations, corresponding to rotational band γ-ray transitions, at γ-ray energies of 0.7 and 1.2 MeV. To shed light on the origin of this structure, we compare the experimental data with the predictions of three model calculations. The origin of the observed correlation structure is understood in terms of a positive spin-energy correlation in the generation of angular momentum in fission.",

Based on this finding, the authors concluded that the spins are therefore determined only after scission has occurred. We show here that the nucleon-exchange mechanism, as implemented in the well-established event-by-event fission model freya, while agitating collective rotational modes in which the two spins are highly correlated, nevertheless leads to fragment spins that are largely uncorrelated. This counterexample invalidates the conclusion in [J. Wilson et al.] that uncorrelated spins must necessarily have been generated after scission (a potentious conclusion that would rule out all models that generate the fragment spins prior to scission). Furthermore, it was reported [J. Wilson et al.] that the mass dependence of the average fragment spin has a sawtooth structure. We demonstrate that such a behavior naturally emerges when shell and deformation effects are included in the moments of inertia of the fragments at scission.",

To assist with the characterization of these OH-PCBs (as methylated derivatives), we developed machine learning-based models with multiple linear regression (MLR) or random forest regression (RFR) to predict the relative retention times (RRT) and MS/MS responses of methoxylated (MeO-)PCBs on a gas chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry system. The final MLR model estimated the retention times of MeO-PCBs with a mean absolute error of 0.55 min (n = 121). The similarity coefficients cos θ between the predicted (by RFR model) and experimental MS/MS data of MeO-PCBs were >0.95 for 92% of observations (n = 96). The levels of MeO-PCBs quantified with the predicted MS/MS response factors approximated the experimental values within a 2-fold difference for 85% of observations and 3-fold differences for all observations (n = 89). Subsequently, these model predictions were used to assist with the identification of OH-PCB 95 or OH-PCB 28 metabolites in mouse feces or liver by suggesting candidate ranking information for identifying the metabolite isomers. Thus, predicted retention and MS/MS response data can assist in identifying unknown OH-PCBs.",

While each study has different experimental needs, the fundamental design of these devices has largely remained unchanged and a systematic study to establish long-term neural cultures in this format is lacking. Here, we investigate the influence of microchannel geometry and cell seeding density on device performance particularly in the context of long-term studies of synaptically-connected, yet fluidically-isolated neural populations of neurons and glia. Of the different experimental parameters, the microchannel height was the principal determinant of device performance, where the other parameters offer additional degrees of freedom in customizing such devices for specific applications. We condense the effects of these parameters into design rules and demonstrate their utility in engineering a microfluidic neural culture platform with integrated microelectrode arrays. The engineered device successfully recorded from primary rat cortical cells for 59 days in vitro with more than on order of magnitude enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio in the microchannels.",

        "abstract": "Although their production was banned in the United States in 1977, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) continue to pose significant risks to the developing nervous system. Perinatal exposure to PCBs is associated with increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, perhaps due to altered patterns of dendritic arborization of central neurons. Non-dioxin-like (NDL) PCB congeners enhance dendritic arborization of developing mammalian neurons via sensitization of ryanodine receptors (RYR). Structure-activity relationships (SAR) of RYR sensitization by PCBs have been demonstrated using mammalian and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) tissue homogenates. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this SAR translates to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) of PCBs in vivo, a question that has yet to be tested. To address this gap, we leveraged a zebrafish model to evaluate the developmental neurotoxicity potential of PCBs 28, 66, 84, 95, 138, and 153, congeners previously shown to have broadly different potencies towards sensitizing RYR. We first confirmed that these PCB congeners exhibited differing potency in sensitizing RYR in zebrafish muscle ranging from negligible (PCB 66) to moderate (PCB 153) to high (PCB 95) RYR activity. Next, enzymatically dechorionated embryos were statically exposed to varying concentrations (0.1-10 μM) of each PCB congener from 6 h post-fertilization to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Embryos were observed daily using stereomicroscopy to assess mortality and gross malformations and photomotor behavior was assessed in larval zebrafish at 3, 4, and 5 dpf. The body burden of each PCB was measured by gas chromatography. The key findings are: 1) None of these PCBs caused death or overt teratology at the concentrations tested; 2) A subset of these PCB congeners altered photomotor behavior in larval zebrafish and the SAR for PCB behavioral effects mirrored the SAR for RYR sensitization; and 3) Quantification of PCB levels in larval zebrafish ruled out the possibility that congener-specific effects on behavior were due to differential uptake of PCB congeners. Collectively, the findings from this study provide in vivo evidence in support of the hypothesis that RYR sensitization contributes to the DNT of PCBs.",

        "abstract": "Despite known pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) including neuronal loss, gliosis (inflammation), beta-amyloid plaque deposition and neurofibrillary tangle accumulation in the brain, little is known about inflammation resolution in early AD pathogenesis. In the brain, inflammation and resolution pathways are mediated by free oxylipins which are mostly bound (i.e. esterified), and therefore must be released (i.e. become free) to exert bioactivity. Recently, we showed reductions in brain esterified pro-resolving oxylipins in a transgenic rat model of AD (TgF344-AD rat) at 15 months of age, suggesting deficits in the source and availability of free pro-resolving oxylipins. In the present study, we tested whether these changes are discernable earlier in the disease process, i.e., at age of 10 months. We observed significant reductions in esterified pro-resolving 8(9)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (8(9)-EpETrE), 13-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid (13-HOTrE) and 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE) oxylipins, and in pro-inflammatory 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 20-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), 15-deoxy-prostaglandin J2 (15-deoxy-PGJ2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) oxylipins in male and/or female transgenic AD rats compared to wildtype controls. These findings point to a deficit in esterified pro-resolving lipid mediators in the early stages of AD, concident with. changes in esterified lipid mediators involved in promoting inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Assessing health outcomes associated with exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is important given their persistent and ubiquitous nature. PCBs are classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, but the full range of potential noncancer health effects from exposure to PCBs has not been systematically summarized and evaluated. We used systematic review methods to identify and screen the literature using combined manual review and machine learning approaches. A protocol was developed that describes the literature search strategy and Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria used to facilitate subsequent screening and categorization of literature into a systematic evidence map of PCB exposure and noncancer health endpoints across 15 organs/systems. A comprehensive literature search yielded 62,599 records. After electronic prioritization steps, 17,037 studies were manually screened at the title and abstract level. An additional 900 studies identified by experts or supplemental searches were also included. After full-text screening of 3889 references, 1586 studies met the PECO criteria. Relevant study details such as the endpoints assessed, exposure duration, and species were extracted into literature summary tables. This review compiles and organizes the human and mammalian studies from these tables into an evidence map for noncancer health endpoints and PCB mixture exposure to identify areas of robust research as well as areas of uncertainty that would benefit from future investigation. Summary data are available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. Sufficient research is available to inform PCB hazard assessments for most organs/systems, but the amount of data to inform associations with specific endpoints differs. Furthermore, despite many years of research, sparse data exist for inhalation and dermal exposures, which are highly relevant human exposure routes. This evidence map provides a foundation for future systematic reviews and noncancer hazard assessments of PCB mixtures and for strategic planning of research to inform areas of greater uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Pathological blood clotting, or thrombosis, limits vital blood flow to organs; such deprivation can lead to catastrophic events including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and ischemic stroke. Prompt restoration of blood flow greatly improves outcomes. We explored whether aptamers could serve as molecular imaging probes to rapidly detect thrombi. An aptamer targeting thrombin, Tog25t, was found to rapidly localize to and visualize pre-existing clots in the femoral and jugular veins of mice using fluorescence imaging and, when circulating, was able to image clots as they form. Since free aptamer is quickly cleared from circulation, contrast is rapidly developed, allowing clot visualization within minutes. Moreover, administration of an antidote oligonucleotide further enhanced contrast development, causing the unbound aptamer to clear within 5min while impacting the clot-bound aptamer more slowly. These findings suggest that aptamers can serve as imaging agents for rapid detection of thrombi in acute care and perioperative settings.",

        "abstract": "Rhesus cytomegalovirus-based (RhCMV-based) vaccine vectors induce immune responses that protect ~60% of rhesus macaques (RMs) from SIVmac239 challenge. This efficacy depends on induction of effector memory-based (EM-biased) CD8+ T cells recognizing SIV peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex-E (MHC-E) instead of MHC-Ia. The phenotype, durability, and efficacy of RhCMV/SIV-elicited cellular immune responses were maintained when vector spread was severely reduced by deleting the antihost intrinsic immunity factor phosphoprotein 71 (pp71). Here, we examined the impact of an even more stringent attenuation strategy on vector-induced immune protection against SIV. Fusion of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) degradation domain to Rh108, the orthologue of the essential human CMV (HCMV) late gene transcription factor UL79, generated RhCMV/SIV vectors that conditionally replicate only when the FK506 analog Shield-1 is present. Despite lacking in vivo dissemination and reduced innate and B cell responses to vaccination, Rh108-deficient 68-1 RhCMV/SIV vectors elicited high-frequency, durable, EM-biased, SIV-specific T cell responses in RhCMV-seropositive RMs at doses of ≥ 1 × 106 PFU. Strikingly, elicited CD8+ T cells exclusively targeted MHC-Ia-restricted epitopes and failed to protect against SIVmac239 challenge. Thus, Rh108-dependent late gene expression is required for both induction of MHC-E-restricted T cells and protection against SIV.",

        "abstract": "Transplantation of allogeneic donor ovarian tissue holds great potential for female cancer survivors who often experience premature ovarian insufficiency. To avoid complications associated with immune suppression and to protect transplanted ovarian allografts from immune-mediated injury, we have developed an immunoisolating hydrogel-based capsule that supports the function of ovarian allografts without triggering an immune response. Encapsulated ovarian allografts implanted in naïve ovariectomized BALB/c mice responded to the circulating gonadotropins and maintained function for 4 months, as evident by regular estrous cycles and the presence of antral follicles in the retrieved grafts. In contrast to non-encapsulated controls, repeated implantations of encapsulated mouse ovarian allografts did not sensitize naïve BALB/c mice, which was confirmed with undetectable levels of alloantibodies. Further, encapsulated allografts implanted in hosts previously sensitized by the implantation of non-encapsulated allografts restored estrous cycles similarly to our results in naïve recipients. Next, we tested the translational potential and efficiency of the immune-isolating capsule in a rhesus monkey model by implanting encapsulated ovarian auto- and allografts in young ovariectomized animals. The encapsulated ovarian grafts survived and restored basal levels of urinary estrone conjugate and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide during the 4- and 5-month observation periods. We demonstrate, for the first time, that encapsulated ovarian allografts functioned for months in young rhesus monkeys and sensitized mice, while the immunoisolating capsule prevented sensitization and protected the allograft from rejection.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the leading infectious cause of neonatal neurological impairment but essential virological determinants of transplacental CMV transmission remain unclear. The pentameric complex (PC), composed of five subunits, glycoproteins H (gH), gL, UL128, UL130, and UL131A, is essential for efficient entry into non-fibroblast cells in vitro . Based on this role in cell tropism, the PC is considered a possible target for CMV vaccines and immunotherapies to prevent cCMV. To determine the role of the PC in transplacental CMV transmission in a non-human primate model of cCMV, we constructed a PC-deficient rhesus CMV (RhCMV) by deleting the homologues of the HCMV PC subunits UL128 and UL130 and compared congenital transmission to PC-intact RhCMV in CD4+ T cell-depleted or immunocompetent RhCMV-seronegative, pregnant rhesus macaques (RM). Surprisingly, we found that the transplacental transmission rate was similar for PC-intact and PC-deleted RhCMV based on viral genomic DNA detection in amniotic fluid. Moreover, PC-deleted and PC-intact RhCMV acute infection led to similar peak maternal plasma viremia. However, there was less viral shedding in maternal urine and saliva and less viral dissemination in fetal tissues in the PC-deleted group. As expected, dams inoculated with PC-deleted RhCMV demonstrated lower plasma IgG binding to PC-intact RhCMV virions and soluble PC, as well as reduced neutralization of PC-dependent entry of the PC-intact RhCMV isolate UCD52 into epithelial cells. In contrast, binding to gH expressed on the cell surface and neutralization of entry into fibroblasts by the PC-intact RhCMV was higher for dams infected with PC-deleted RhCMV compared to those infected with PC-intact RhCMV. Our data demonstrates that the PC is dispensable for transplacental CMV infection in our non-human primate model. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: Congenital CMV transmission frequency in seronegative rhesus macaques is not affected by the deletion of the viral pentameric complex.",

        "abstract": "Lateral spreading of an interlayered deposit adjacent to a meandering stream channel in Wufeng, Taiwan, during the 1999 Chi-Chi Earthquake is evaluated using two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear dynamic analyses (NDAs) with geostatistical modeling of the subsurface to assess their ability to approximate the observed magnitude and spatial extent of ground deformations, as well as identify the key factors and mechanisms that most contributed to the overall system response. In-situ data from borings and cone penetration tests (CPTs) depict thinly stratified overbank deposits of low-plasticity silty sands, silts, and clays, interlayered with laterally discontinuous channel-deposited sands. The three-dimensional (3D) subsurface is simulated using transition probability-based indicator geostatistics, conditioned on available CPT data and geological inferences. The NDAs are performed using the PM4Sand and PM4Silt constitutive models, within the FLAC finite difference program. Sensitivity analyses are performed to understand the influence of uncertainties in the stratigraphy, channel conditions, soil properties, input ground motions, constitutive model calibration protocols, and numerical boundary conditions, as well as the performance of alternate channel transects. Most analysis cases generally matched the maximum displacements observed near the channel but overestimated the extent of displacements away from the channel. The most favorable results were largely influenced by nonstationary stratigraphic trends and cyclic softening of fine-grained soils, in addition to the liquefaction of coarse-grained soils. This case history demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current subsurface and NDA modeling procedures for predicting ground deformation patterns.",

        "abstract": "Soil penetration is a ubiquitous energy-intensive process in geotechnical engineering that is typically accomplished by quasi-static pushing, impact driving, or excavating. In contrast, organisms such as marine and earthworms, razor clams, and plants have developed efficient penetration strategies. Using motion sequences inspired by these organisms, a probe that uses a self-contained anchor to generate the reaction force required to advance its tip to greater depths has been conceptualized. This study explores the interactions between this probe and coarse-grained soil using 3D discrete element modeling. Spatial distributions of soil effective stresses indicate that expansion of the anchor produces arching and rotation of principal effective stresses that facilitate penetration by inducing stress relaxation around the probe’s tip and stress increase around the anchor. Spatial strain maps highlight the volumetric deformations around the probe, while measurements of both stresses and strains show that the state of the soil around the anchor and tip evolves toward the critical state line. During subsequent tip advancement, the stresses and strains are similar to those during initial insertion, leading to the remobilization of the tip resistance. Longer anchor and shorter anchor-to-tip distance better facilitate tip advancement by producing greater stress relaxation ahead of the tip.",

        "abstract": "Insufficient reaction force generated by installation equipment is one of the main challenges in soil penetration processes, which can lead to refusal conditions or pullout failures during in situ testing, soil sampling, and pile driving. Recent research has focused on developing probes for site characterization that can generate the reaction force required for probe insertion without external equipment. This study presents the results of 3D discrete element modeling (DEM) simulations of probes with single or dual anchors performed in a virtual calibration chamber (VCC) that applies a constant overburden pressure of 100 kPa. Following penetration of the probe to the desired depth, the anchors are expanded and then a single tip advancement stage is simulated using either displacement-controlled or force-limited motion. The simulation results indicate that dual-anchor probes generate greater capacities than single-anchor probes due to the mobilization of additional bearing forces. However, the capacity per anchor increases with increasing inter-anchor spacing due to the development of an active zone below the leading anchor which produces a decrease in effective stresses around the trailing anchor. During expansion of the anchors, the penetration resistances decrease due to the alteration of stresses around the probe tip. The simulation results are used to define a dimensionless 3D space to determine the combination of probe configurations that enable self-penetration; these configurations include greater inter-anchor spacings, smaller anchor-tip distances, and greater anchor expansion magnitudes.",

Stimulating the growth of indigenous bacteria could clog the pore space and result in a substantial permeability reduction. This study investigated the spatial distribution of permeability reduction under different nutrient stimulation treatments of indigenous bacteria across 16 cm columns of Ottawa 50-70 sand. Spatially uniform permeability reductions of up to an order of magnitude were achieved using both a high glucose (50 mg/l) and a low glucose (10 mg/l) nutrient formulation. The overall permeability began to decrease by day 2 and approached a minimum permeability by day 14. There was no noticeable difference in the final permeability nor the rate of permeability reduction between high and low glucose formulations. Upscaling of experiments is highly recommended for future studies on the spatial uniformity of microbial growth and biologically induced permeability reductions.",

        "abstract": "Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) involves a series of bio-geochemical reactions whereby microbes alter the surrounding aqueous environment and induce calcium carbonate precipitation. MICP has a broad range of applications, including in situ soil stabilization. However, the reliability of this process is dependent on a number of environmental conditions. In particular, bacterial growth, urease activity and precipitation kinetics all depend on temperature. Batch test and microfluidic chip experiments were performed in this study to investigate the effects of temperature on bacterial density and activity and the MICP processes occurring at different temperatures (4–50 °C). Spatial and temporal variations in the formation and development of calcium carbonate precipitates, including their amount, type, growth rate, formation and deformation characteristics, were monitored. Results show that different types of calcium carbonate precipitates with varying sizes and quantities were produced by varying the temperature. Low temperature (4 °C) did not reduce urease activity, but limited the final amount of cementation; low temperature reduced bacterial growth and attachment ratio, as well as calcium carbonate precipitation rate. High-temperature (50 °C) conditions significantly reduced urease activity within a short period of time, while a repeated injection of bacteria before every two injections of cementation solution increased the final amount of cementation. The findings made from this paper provide insight into how MICP processes vary across a range of temperatures and could be valuable for optimizing the MICP process for different applications.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral anticoagulants (OACs) mitigate stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The study aim was to analyze prevalence and predictors of OAC underutilization. METHODS: Newly diagnosed AF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 were identified from the US CMS Database (January 1, 2013-December 31, 2017). Patients were stratified based on having an OAC prescription versus not and the OAC prescription group was stratified by direct OAC (DOACs) versus warfarin. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of OAC underutilization. RESULTS: Among 1,204,507 identified AF patients, 617,611 patients (51.3%) were not prescribed an OAC during follow-up (mean: 2.4 years), and 586,896 patients (48.7%) were prescribed an OAC during this period (DOAC: 388,629 [66.2%]; warfarin: 198,267 [33.8%]). Age ≥ 85 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.56), female sex (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.96), Black race (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.77-0.79) and comorbidities such as gastrointestinal (GI; OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.41-0.44) and intracranial bleeding (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.28-0.31) were associated with lower utilization of OACs. Furthermore, age ≥ 85 years (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.91-0.94), Black race (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76-0.80), ischemic stroke (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.75-0.80), GI bleeding (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.77), and intracranial bleeding (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.65-0.80) predicted lower use of DOACs versus warfarin. CONCLUSIONS: Although OAC therapy prescription is the standard of care for stroke prevention in AF patients, its overall utilization is still low among Medicare patients ≥ 65 years old, with specific patient characteristics that predict underutilization.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Early recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia (ER) is predictive of late recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia (LR) after first-time atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, but the association in patients undergoing repeat AF ablation is unknown. We aim to determine the incidence and prognostic significance of ER after repeat ablation. METHODS: A total of 259 consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, 75.3% male) undergoing repeat AF ablation with complete follow-up data were included at a single institution from 2010 to 2015. ER and LR were defined as atrial tachyarrhythmia (AF, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia) > 30 s within the 3-month blanking period (BP) and after the 3-month BP, respectively. RESULTS: ER occurred in 79/259 (30.5%), and LR occurred in 138/259 (53%) at a median follow-up of 1221 (IQR: 523-1712) days. Four-year freedom from LR was 22% and 56% in patients with and without ER, respectively (p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, ER was strongly associated with LR, cardioversion post BP, and repeat ablation, but not associated with hospitalization. Compared to those with no ER, there was a higher risk of LR when ER occurred within the first month of the BP [month 1: hazard ratio (HR) 2.32, confidence interval (CI) 1.57-3.74, p < 0.001; month 2: HR 2.01, CI 1.13-3.83, p = 0.02; month 3: HR 1.46, CI 0.5-3.36, p = 0.37], however the prediction of LR based on timing within the BP was poor (area under curve 0.64). CONCLUSION: Following repeat AF ablation, ER is strongly associated with LR, cardioversion post BP, and repeat ablation.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: To determine outcomes in atrial fibrillation patients undergoing percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) based on the underlying stroke risk (defined by the CHA2DS2-VASc score). METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were extracted from the National Inpatient Sample for calendar years 2016-20. Left atrial appendage occlusion implantations were identified on the basis of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification code of 02L73DK. The study sample was stratified on the basis of the CHA2DS2-VASc score into three groups (scores of 3, 4, and ≥5). The outcomes assessed in our study included complications and resource utilization. A total of 73 795 LAAO device implantations were studied. Approximately 63% of LAAO device implantations occurred in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 4 and ≥5. The crude prevalence of pericardial effusion requiring intervention was higher with increased CHA2DS2-VASc score (1.4% in patients with a score of ≥5 vs. 1.1% in patients with a score of 4 vs. 0.8% in patients with a score of 3, P < 0.01). In the multivariable model adjusted for potential confounders, CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 4 and ≥5 were found to be independently associated with overall complications [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.35, and aOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.73-2.04, respectively] and prolonged length of stay (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.25, and aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.66, respectively). CONCLUSION: A higher CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with an increased risk of peri-procedural complications and resource utilization after LAAO. These findings highlight the importance of patient selection for the LAAO procedure and need validation in future studies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in real-world utilization and in-hospital adverse events from Watchman implantation since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015. BACKGROUND: The risk of embolic stroke caused by atrial fibrillation is reduced by oral anticoagulants, but not all patients can tolerate long-term anticoagulation. Left atrial appendage occlusion with the Watchman device has emerged as an alternative therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing data from National Inpatient Sample for calendar years 2015-2017. The outcomes assessed in this study were associated complications, in-hospital mortality, and resource utilization trends after Watchman implantation. Trends analysis were performed using analysis of variance. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 17 700 patients underwent Watchman implantation during the study period. There was a significantly increased trend in the number of Watchman procedures performed over the study years (from 1195 in 2015 to 11 165 devices in 2017, p < .01). A significant decline in the rate of complications (from 26.4% in 2015% to 7.9% in 2017, p < .01) and inpatient mortality (from 1.3% in 2015% to 0.1% in 2017, p < .01) were noted. Predictors of in-hospital mortality included a higher CHA2 DS2 -VASc score (odds ratio [OR]: 2.61 per 1-point increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.91-3.57), chronic blood loss anemia (OR: 3.63, 95% CI: 1.37-9.61) and coagulopathy (OR: 4.90, 95% CI: 2.32-10.35). CONCLUSION: In contemporary United States clinical practice, Watchman utilization has increased significantly since approval in 2015, while complications and in-patient mortality have declined.",

ANIMALS: Dogs (n=22) with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture and 12 control dogs. METHODS: Concentrations of collagenase-generated cleavage epitope of type II collagen (Col2-3/4C(long mono), or C2C) in serum, urine, and joint fluid were compared between a group of dogs with CCL rupture and a control group. Correlation of C2C concentrations to the clinical stage of stifle OA was also evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in C2C concentrations in serum, urine, and joint fluid between groups (P>.05). Subjective scores of lameness, joint effusion, osteophytosis were significantly more severe in the CCL rupture group compared with the control group (P<.05). There was no significant correlation of C2C concentrations with clinical stage of stifle OA (P>.05). CONCLUSION: This OA biomarker did not detect pathology associated with CCL rupture. Our results suggest that collagenase-specific degradation of type II collagen in articular cartilage may not be involved in the early stage of naturally occurring canine cruciate disease, and that pathology associated with naturally occurring CCL rupture is different from that of experimental OA model. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: C2C is not clinically useful in detecting CCL rupture in dogs.",

The macaque presented to the veterinary clinic with grossly contaminated bite wounds in the left ankle secondary to conspecific trauma. Radiographic findings were highly suggestive of osteomyelitis. Additional differential diagnoses included bony infarct, fracture, and cellulitis. In light of the location of the lesion and extensive tissue trauma, the animal had a poor prognosis. Systemic, broad-spectrum antibiotics were instituted. After 2 wk of care, lesions did not respond to empirical therapies. On consultation, a veterinary orthopedic surgeon at another facility recommended placement of antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads at the sites of osteomyelitis. The animal underwent minor surgery in which beads were introduced into the wound. The monkey had a positive response to therapy. The animal regained full function and was returned to outdoor social housing. Veterinarians are encouraged to consider using antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads when treating osteomyelitis in other nonhuman primates and in other traditional laboratory animal species.",

STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional clinical study. ANIMALS: Dogs (n=19; 35 elbows) with MCD and dogs (8; 16 elbows) with unaffected elbows. METHODS: Concentrations of a collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitope of type II collagen (Col2-3/4C(long mono), or C2C) in joint fluid from elbows were analyzed and compared between dogs with MCD and unaffected dogs. Correlation of C2C concentration with subjective grading of articular cartilage surface damage was also evaluated. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) C2C concentration from MCD dogs was significantly higher (112.3+/-24.8 ng/mL) than in unaffected dogs (76.1+/-16.9 ng/mL; P<.05). There was a moderate correlation between cartilage damage grade and increasing C2C concentrations (P<.05, r=0.62) CONCLUSION: C2C concentrations are elevated in the synovial fluid of dogs with MCD compared with unaffected elbows, and a moderate, significant correlation was identified between these concentrations and subjective grading of articular cartilage damage. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This preliminary data suggest that C2C concentrations in synovial fluid may have potential as a biomarker for diagnosis of articular cartilage damage associated with MCD and as a means of objectively determining the degree of articular cartilage damage.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To perform in vivo evaluation of the structural morphology and vascular plexuses of the neurosensory retina and choroid across vertebrate species using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) and SS-OCT angiography (SS-OCTA) imaging. METHODS: A custom-built SS-OCT system with an incorporated flexible imaging arm was used to acquire the three-dimensional (3D) retinal OCT and vascular OCTA data of five different vertebrates: a mouse (C57BL/6J), a rat (Long Evans), a gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica), a white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and a great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). RESULTS: In vivo structural morphology of the retina and choroid, as well as en face OCTA images of retinal and choroidal vasculature of all species were generated. The retinal morphology and vascular plexuses were similar between rat and mouse, whereas distinct choroidal and paired superficial vessels were observed in the opossum retina. The retinal and vascular structure of the sturgeon, as well as the pecten oculi and overlying the avascular and choroidal vasculature in the owl retina are reported in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: A high-quality two-dimensional and 3D in vivo visualization of the retinal structures and en face visualization of the retina and choroidal vascular plexus of vertebrates was possible. Our studies affirm that SS-OCT and SS-OCTA are viable methods for evaluating the in vivo retinal and choroidal structure across terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial vertebrates. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: In vivo characterization of retinal morphology and vasculature plexus of multiple species using SS-OCT and SS-OCTA imaging can increase the pool of species available as models of human retinal diseases.",

        "abstract": "The scarcity of high quality irrigation water is a global issue facing rice growers, forcing many to adopt water management systems that may result in increased salinity and yield reductions. While salt concentrations in field water have been shown to vary depending on water management, the distribution and build-up patterns of dissolved salts are unclear. This study was conducted to elucidate the within field spatial and temporal salinity dynamics in water-seeded rice cropping systems, and to assess current salinity thresholds for rice yield reduction. In this two-year study, water and soil salinity concentrations of eleven field sites were monitored weekly, with three sampling points being established in the top, middle and bottom basins of each field. There was a consistent spatio-temporal water salinity pattern among all fields: the maximum water salinity within a field occurred during week 2 to week 7 after planting, and was greatest farther from the irrigation inlet and where soil salinity was high. A model developed to predict water salinity within a field indicates that, averaged over an entire growing season, the position within a field contributed to 82% of the variation explained by the model, while preseason soil salinity contributed to 18%. Importantly, field water salinity was determined to be the most sensitive salinity metric for rice yield, as preseason soil salinity was a poor predictor of yield loss. The threshold field water salinity concentration was estimated at 0.88 dS m−1, lower than the previous report of 1.9 dS m−1. These results illustrate the ability to predict water salinity in a rice field with few parameters, while highlighting the importance of field water salinity as the main salinity metric for rice cropping systems.",

        "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation is an important part of global food security, yet it is also responsible for a significant portion of agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly methane (CH4). Midseason drainage of flooded rice fields can decrease CH4 emissions, but the magnitude of CH4 reduction and its effect on grain yield are variable due to variation in the timing and soil-drying severity of drainage across studies. Therefore, in this two-year study, we aimed to quantify the effect of timing and severity of a single midseason drainage event on seasonal GHG emissions and grain yields, compared to a continuously flooded (CF) control. Treatments varied in terms of soil-drying severity (low, medium, and high, corresponding to approximately 5, 8, and 12 days of drying, respectively) and the timing of when drainage events occurred (between 34–49 and 45–59 days after seeding, or roughly between tillering and panicle initiation). Soil moisture parameters (perched water table, volumetric water content, gravimetric water content (GWC), and soil water potential), soil mineral nitrogen, CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, grain yield, and yield components were all quantified. Midseason drainage reduced seasonal CH4 emissions by 38–66%, compared to the CF control. Seasonal CH4 emissions decreased with increasing drain severity, and for every 1% reduction in soil GWC during the drainage period, seasonal CH4 emissions were reduced by 2.5%. The timing of drainage had no significant impact on CH4 emissions. Emissions of N2O were low (average = 0.035 kg N2O-N ha−1) and accounted for only 0.5% of the seasonal global warming potential (GWP) across all drainage treatments. Within each year, drainage did not significantly affect grain yield compared to the CF control. Additionally, midseason drainage reduced both GWP and yield-scaled GWP by approximately the same amount as seasonal CH4 emissions, as N2O emissions were minimal and yields were similar across treatments. These results indicate that midseason drainage may be a viable GHG mitigation practice in flooded rice systems with limited risk for yield reduction, however, this practice should also be further tested under a broad range of soil types and different environments to determine its widespread adoptability.",

        "abstract": "Nutrient losses from rice fields can have economic and environmental consequences. Little is known about nutrient losses in surface runoff waters from direct-seeded rice systems, which are common in the United States and increasingly more so in Asia. The objectives of this research were to quantify nutrient losses from California rice fields in surface runoff waters and to determine when and under what conditions losses are greatest. Research was conducted in 10 rice fields varying in residue (burned or incorporated) and water management over a 2-yr period. Concentrations of NH-N and NO-N in runoff water across sites, seasons, and management practices averaged <0.1 mg N L. Runoff water PO-P concentration averaged 0.14 mg L and was not affected by season or straw management practices. However, P fluxes were higher in the winter when rice straw was burned (2.59 kg ha) as opposed to incorporated (0.44 kg ha). Average seasonal runoff water K concentrations did not vary with season and straw management, although they were highest at the onset of the winter season. Average total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations did not vary by season but were highest during the winter in the straw-incorporated fields (46 mg L). Rice fields were sinks for K (4.9 kg K ha) during the growing season. Fields were not significant sources of nutrients or TSS during the growing season; however, during the winter fallow they could be sources of NH-N, P, K, and TSS, especially as water fluxes from fields increased.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus, an essential element for plant and animal growth, can also impair water quality. Understanding management effects on P dynamics can aid in the management of these systems to reduce nonpoint source pollution and improve fertilizer use efficiency. A sequential P fractionation procedure was used to evaluate labile to recalcitrant inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) fractions in wetland rice soils. In this study we evaluated 71 wetland soils in the Sacramento Valley, California, consisting of different soil orders (Alfisols, Entisols, Mollisols and Vertisols) and different management systems (conventional rice, organic rice and natural wetlands). Total soil P ranged from 165 to 784 μg g-1 and averaged 415 μg g-1. Mollisols contained significantly more Pi and Po than all other soils; especially more HCl-Pi and Po. Although most studies ignore Po in the HCl fraction, 9% of total P was recovered in this fraction, suggesting that this fraction should not be ignored in studies aimed at quantifying and understanding organic P. The HCl-Po fraction was closely correlated with HCl-Pi, suggesting that it may be Ca bound P. Soils managed under organic rice production had higher NaHCO3-Pi and NaOH-Pi levels than conventional rice systems; while the natural wetland systems showed intermediate amounts. Organic or synthetic P fertilizers applied in excess of the amount of P that is removed during harvest was recovered as NaHCO3-Pi and NaOH-Pi. © 2010 The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "This study examines the effects of straw management and winter flooding on soil N dynamics and crop N uptake in California rice (Oryza sativa L.) systems. Experiments were established in two locations in northern California with main plot treatments being winter flooding or no flooding; and four straw management practices (burn, remove, incorporate, and roll) as subplot treatments. Fertilizer was applied to the plots at the recommended levels for each site, but within each plot a zero N microplot was established. Total straw inputs before winter flooding averaged 7000 kg ha-1 for the incorporate and roll treatments, 4200 kg ha-1 for the remove, and 1600 kg ha-1 for the burn treatment (straw N ranged from 11 to 66 kg ha-1). Before flooding the field for planting, there was 9% less straw in winter flooded plots compared to nonflooded plots. Straw incorporation resulted in more rapid straw decomposition compared to other treatments where the straw was not incorporated. Furthermore, potentially mineralizable N and soil extractable N was higher in the winter flooded treatments and where rice straw was retained. Crop response varied between sites but our results suggest that N fertilizer recommendations could potentially be reduced by 20 kg ha-1 if straw is incorporated and winter flooded. © American Society of Agronomy.",

        "issued": "2022-10",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidural injections are among the most commonly performed procedures for managing low back and lower extremity pain. Pinto et al and Chou et al previously performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which, along with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing the lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and radiculopathy. In contrast to these papers, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the effectiveness and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopically guided techniques. A major flaw in the review can be related to attributing active-controlled trials to placebo-controlled trials. The assumption that local anesthetics do not provide sustained benefit, despite extensive evidence that local anesthetics provide long-term relief, similar to a combination of local anesthetic with steroids is flawed. STUDY DESIGN: The Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy were reanalyzed using systematic methodology and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To re-evaluate Cochrane data on RCTs of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy utilizing qualitative and quantitative techniques with dual-arm and single-arm analysis. METHODS: In this systematic review, we have used the same RCTs from the Cochrane Review of a minimum of 20% change in pain scale or significant pain relief of >= 50%. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Our review was performed utilizing the Cochrane Review methodologic quality assessment and the Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB). Evidence was summarized utilizing the principles of best evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system. Clinical relevance of the pragmatic nature of each study was assessed. RESULTS: In evaluating the RCTs in the Cochrane Review, 10 trials were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. Utilizing conventional dual-arm and single-arm meta-analysis, the evidence is vastly different from the interpretation of the data within the Cochrane Review. The overall combined evidence is Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months, and Level II, or moderate evidence, at 6 and 12 months. LIMITATIONS: The limitation of this study is that only data contained in the Cochrane Review were analyzed. CONCLUSION: A comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of the Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy yielded different results. This review, based on the evidence derived from placebo-controlled trials and active-controlled trials showed Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months and Level II at 6 and 12 months. This review once again emphasizes the importance of the allocation of studies to placebo-control and active-control groups, utilizing standards of practice with inclusion of only the studies performed under fluoroscopic guidance.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major disruptions in all aspects of human life including a decline of medical services utilized during 2020. An analysis of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic showed an 18.7% reduction in utilization patterns of interventional techniques in managing chronic pain in the Medicare population from 2019 to 2020. However, specific changes in utilization patterns of facet joint interventions have not been studied. Thus, we sought to assess the utilization patterns including an update of facet joint interventions from 2018 to 2020, with analysis of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in managing chronic spinal pain utilizing facet joint interventions in the fee-for-service Medicare population of the United States. METHODS: The present investigation was designed to assess utilization patterns and variables of facet joint interventions, in managing chronic spinal pain from 2010 to 2020 in the fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare population in the United States (US), and how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted these utilization patterns. Data for the analysis were obtained from the master database from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) physician/supplier procedure summary from 2000 to 2020. RESULTS: Results of this analysis showed significant impact of COVID-19 with overall decrease of 18.5% of all facet joint interventions per 100,000 Medicare population compared to 20.2 and 20.5% decrease for lumbar and cervical facet joint injections, 15 and 13.1% decrease per 100,000 Medicare population of lumbosacral and cervicothoracic facet joint neurolysis procedures. The results are significant in that comparative analysis from 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2019 showing an annual increase of 14.4 vs. 2.2%, illustrating a decelerating pattern. There were also significant growth patterns noted with decreases in facet joint injections and nerve blocks compared to facet joint neurolytic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows a significant effect of COVID-19 producing an overall decrease in utilization of facet joint interventions relative to pre-COVID data. Further, the analysis demonstrates continued deceleration of utilization patterns of facet joint interventions compared to the periods of 2000-2010 and 2010-2019.",

        "abstract": "<jats:p>BACKGROUND: Chronic spinal pain is the most prevalent chronic disease with employment of multiple modes of interventional techniques including epidural interventions. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, systematic reviews, and guidelines have been published. The recent review of the utilization patterns and expenditures show that there has been a decline in utilization of epidural injections with decrease in inflation adjusted costs from 2009 to 2018. The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) published guidelines for interventional techniques in 2013, and guidelines for facet joint interventions in 2020. Consequently, these guidelines have been prepared to update previously existing guidelines. \n\nOBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based guidance in performing therapeutic epidural procedures, including caudal, interlaminar in lumbar, cervical, and thoracic spinal regions, transforaminal in lumbar spine, and percutaneous adhesiolysis in the lumbar spine. \n\nMETHODS: The methodology utilized included the development of objective and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards. The literature pertaining to all aspects of epidural interventions was viewed with best evidence synthesis of available literature and  recommendations were provided. \n\nRESULTS: In preparation of the guidelines, extensive literature review was performed. In addition to review of multiple manuscripts in reference to utilization, expenditures, anatomical and pathophysiological considerations, pharmacological and harmful effects of drugs and procedures, for evidence synthesis we have included 47 systematic reviews and 43 RCTs covering all epidural interventions to meet the objectives.\n\nThe evidence recommendations are as follows: \nDisc herniation: Based on relevant, high-quality fluoroscopically guided epidural injections, with or without steroids, and results of previous systematic reviews, the evidence is Level I for caudal epidural injections, lumbar interlaminar epidural injections, lumbar transforaminal epidural injections, and cervical interlaminar epidural injections with strong recommendation for long-term effectiveness.\n\nThe evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing disc herniation based on one high-quality, placebo-controlled RCT is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term improvement in patients nonresponsive to conservative management and fluoroscopically guided epidural injections. \n\nFor thoracic disc herniation, based on one relevant, high-quality RCT of thoracic epidural with fluoroscopic guidance, with or without steroids, the evidence is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term effectiveness.\n\nSpinal stenosis: The evidence based on one high-quality RCT in each category the evidence is Level III to II for fluoroscopically guided caudal epidural injections with moderate to strong recommendation and Level II for fluoroscopically guided lumbar and cervical interlaminar epidural injections with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term effectiveness.\n\nThe evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural injections is Level IV to III with moderate recommendation with fluoroscopically guided lumbar transforaminal epidural injections for long-term improvement. \n\nThe evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis in lumbar stenosis based on relevant, moderate to high quality RCTs, observational studies, and systematic reviews is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term improvement after failure of conservative management and fluoroscopically guided epidural injections. \n\nAxial discogenic pain: The evidence for axial discogenic pain without facet joint pain or sacroiliac joint pain in the lumbar and cervical spine with fluoroscopically guided caudal, lumbar and cervical interlaminar epidural injections, based on one relevant high quality RCT in each category is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term improvement, with or without steroids. \n\nPost-surgery syndrome: The evidence for lumbar and cervical post-surgery syndrome based on one relevant, high-quality RCT with fluoroscopic guidance for caudal and cervical interlaminar epidural injections, with or without steroids, is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term improvement. \n\nFor percutaneous adhesiolysis, based on multiple moderate to high-quality RCTs and systematic reviews, the evidence is Level I with strong recommendation for long-term improvement after failure of conservative management and fluoroscopically guided epidural injections.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The limitations of these guidelines include a continued paucity of high-quality studies for some techniques and various conditions including spinal stenosis, post-surgery syndrome, and discogenic pain.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These epidural intervention guidelines including percutaneous adhesiolysis were prepared with a comprehensive review of the literature with methodologic quality assessment and determination of level of evidence with strength of recommendations. \n\nKEY WORDS: Chronic spinal pain, interventional techniques, epidural procedures, caudal epidural, lumbar interlaminar epidural, cervical interlaminar epidural, thoracic interlaminar epidural, lumbar transforaminal epidural, percutaneous adhesiolysis\n\nDISCLAIMER: These guidelines are based on the best available evidence and do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of three doses of gadobutrol and determine the minimum effective dose for contrast-enhanced MRI of the central nervous system (CNS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a Phase II, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group controlled study in subjects referred for contrast-enhanced MRI of the CNS. Subjects were randomized to receive gadobutrol 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mmol/kg body weight, and underwent unenhanced, gadobutrol-enhanced, and comparator-enhanced MRI scans. Three blinded readers assessed the images. Primary efficacy variables were number of lesions detected, border delineation, contrast enhancement, and internal morphology. RESULTS: Of the 229 randomized subjects, 173 were evaluated for efficacy. Clinically meaningful improvements in lesion border delineation, contrast enhancement, and internal morphology were observed for 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol. Pair-wise comparisons of a composite score of the four primary variables showed the 0.1 mmol/kg dose to be statistically superior to the 0.03 mmol/kg dose (P = 0.003). The 0.3 mmol/kg dose showed no statistically significant difference with the 0.1 mmol/kg dose. Twenty-two (9.8%) subjects reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). No TEAE was reported at an incidence >3.5%. CONCLUSION: The 0.1 mmol/kg dose of gadobutrol was effective and well tolerated for contrast-enhanced MRI of the CNS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with dysregulated inflammation. The effects of combination treatment with baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, plus remdesivir are not known. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating baricitinib plus remdesivir in hospitalized adults with Covid-19. All the patients received remdesivir (≤10 days) and either baricitinib (≤14 days) or placebo (control). The primary outcome was the time to recovery. The key secondary outcome was clinical status at day 15. RESULTS: A total of 1033 patients underwent randomization (with 515 assigned to combination treatment and 518 to control). Patients receiving baricitinib had a median time to recovery of 7 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 8), as compared with 8 days (95% CI, 7 to 9) with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.32; P = 0.03), and a 30% higher odds of improvement in clinical status at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.6). Patients receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation at enrollment had a time to recovery of 10 days with combination treatment and 18 days with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.08). The 28-day mortality was 5.1% in the combination group and 7.8% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.09). Serious adverse events were less frequent in the combination group than in the control group (16.0% vs. 21.0%; difference, -5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.8 to -0.3; P = 0.03), as were new infections (5.9% vs. 11.2%; difference, -5.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.7 to -1.9; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Baricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status among patients with Covid-19, notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation. The combination was associated with fewer serious adverse events. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04401579.).",

        "abstract": "This report describes experiments assessing the effectiveness against HIV of potential disinfecting agents that are commonly available to IDU when they are sharing syringes. We exposed cell-free HIV, HIV-infected cells, and HIV-infected blood containing known quantities of HIV to household cleaning agents, alcohols, peroxide, and highly acidic materials for 1 min, in order to examine the effects of these materials on the infectivity of the HIV. Undiluted liquid laundry bleach and dilute liquid dish detergent reduced the number of culturable HIV to an undetectable level under the experimental conditions used. Diluted bleach was not completely effective. Other potential disinfecting agents, including ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide, were unable to disinfect high numbers of HIV-infected cells or infected blood. Liquid dish detergent warrants further study as a possible acceptable alternative to bleach. Our data provide support for recommendations to IDU that they disinfect shared syringes every time between users with full-strength liquid laundry bleach to reduce their risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. When bleach is not available, liquid dish detergent or other available disinfecting agents such as rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or high alcohol content beverages are more effective than water at disinfecting HIV, recognizing that these materials are less effective than bleach. Although these materials are effective, they should not be viewed as a substitute for decreased sharing of injection equipment by IDU, or increased availability of sterile needles and syringes.",

Toxins A and B are among the largest known bacterial toxins expressing potent cytotoxicity and enterotoxicity, and thus the major virulence factors in C. difficile associated diarrhea. Cloning and sequencing of toxin genes is of interest for studies of molecular pathogenesis. We report the amplification and cloning of the complete toxin A gene into an Escherichia coli expression vector. Ten clones analyzed contained the complete toxin A gene. Four of these clones showed cytotoxic activity in cell culture, and were positive for toxin A as determined by ELISA. Toxin A expression was confirmed by Western immunoblot analysis. The presence of cytotoxic activity in cell culture suggests that toxin A activity is independent of other genes in the pathogenicity locus.",

        "issued": "2012-12",
        "abstract": "Direct tests for Clostridium difficile are 30-50 % more sensitive than tests for C. difficile toxins but the reasons for this discrepancy are incompletely understood. In addition to toxin degradation and strain differences, we hypothesized that C. difficile concentration could be important in determining whether toxins are detected in fecal samples. We performed standard curves on an FDA-approved real-time PCR test for the C. difficile tcdB gene (Xpert C. difficile/Epi, Cepheid) during a prospective comparison of a toxin immunoassay (Meridian Premier), PCR and toxigenic culture. Immunoassay-negative, PCR-positive samples were retested with a cell cytotoxin assay (TechLab). Among 107 PCR-positive samples, 46 (43.0 %) had toxins detected by immunoassay and an additional 18 (16.8 %) had toxin detected by the cytotoxin assay yielding 64 (59.8 %) toxin-positive and 43 (40.2 %) toxin-negative samples. Overall, toxin-negative samples with C. difficile had 10(1)-10(4) fewer DNA copies than toxin-positive samples and most discrepancies between toxin tests and PCR were associated with a significant difference in C. difficile quantity. Of the toxin-positive samples, 95 % had ≥ 4.1 log(10) C. difficile tcdB DNA copies/mL; 52 % of immunoassay-negative samples and 70 % of immunoassay and cytotoxin negative samples had <4.1 log(10) C. difficile tcdB DNA copies/mL. These findings suggest that fecal C. difficile concentration is a major determinant of toxin detection and C. difficile quantitation may add to the diagnostic value of existing test methods. Future studies are needed to validate the utility of quantitation and determine the significance of low concentrations of C. difficile in the absence of detectable toxin.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical presentation of emergency department (ED) patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: This was a retrospective medical record review of adult patients, identified through infection control records, diagnosed as having active pulmonary TB by sputum culture over a 30-month period at an urban teaching hospital. The ED visits by these patients from one year before to one year after the initial positive sputum culture were categorized as contagious or noncontagious, using defined clinical and radiographic criteria. The medical records of patients with contagious visits to the ED were reviewed to determine chief complaint, presence of TB risk factors and symptoms, and physical examination and chest radiograph findings. RESULTS: During the study period, 44 patients with active pulmonary TB made 66 contagious ED visits. Multiple contagious ED visits were made by 12 patients (27%; 95% CI = 15% to 43%). Chief complaints were pulmonary 33% (95% CI = 22% to 46%), medical but nonpulmonary 41% (95% CI = 29% to 54%), infectious but nonpulmonary 14% (95% CI = 6% to 24%), and traumatic/orthopedic 12% (95% CI = 5% to 22%). At least one TB risk factor was identified in 57 (86%; 95% CI% = 76 to 94%) patient visits and at least one TB symptom in 51 (77%; 95% CI = 65% to 87%) patient visits. Cough was present during only 64% (95% CI = 51% to 75%) of the patient visits and hemoptysis during 8% (95% CI = 3% to 17%). Risk factors and symptoms that, if present, were likely to be detected at triage were foreign birth, homelessness, HIV positivity, hemoptysis, and chest pain. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active pulmonary TB may have multiple ED visits, and often have nonpulmonary complaints. Tuberculosis risk factors and symptoms are usually present in these patients but often missed at ED triage. The diversity of clinical presentations among ED patients with pulmonary TB will likely make it difficult to develop and implement high-yield triage screening criteria.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe the first series of six young uveal melanoma (UM) patients with oral isotretinoin and/or topical retinoid therapy prior to diagnosis. OBSERVATIONS: The case series is based on clinical observations at our UM quaternary referral center. Six UM patient cases are reported, ages 16-44 years old. All had been using either oral (isotretinoin) and/or topical (tretinoin or tazarotene) retinoid treatment (3 months-~10 years) prior to or at the time of diagnosis (3 of 6 cases). All patients had ocular complaints on presentation, and the onset of certain symptoms corresponded with the course of retinoids. Other potential risk factors or relevant history included Caucasian background, cone-rod dystrophy and active smoker status (Case 2), family history of UM and pregnancy at time of diagnosis (Case 3), past smoking and possible secondary Chernobyl exposure as a baby (Case 5). All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy and currently have no sign of recurrent or metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Retinoid therapy has been linked to various benign and/or reversible effects on the anterior and posterior eye, though pathophysiology remains not well understood. Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare cancer diagnosis in young adults. We report here the first case series of young UM patients with a history of retinoid use and ocular complaints. No causal link is claimed and further systematic epidemiologic and biologic study of retinoid therapy and ocular impact may provide additional relevant data, particularly in young ocular melanoma patients.",

        "abstract": "Human CD34 + stem cells are mobilized from bone marrow to sites of tissue ischemia and play an important role in tissue revascularization. This study used a murine model to test the hypothesis that intravitreal injection of human CD34 + stem cells harvested from bone marrow (BMSCs) can have protective effects in eyes with diabetic retinopathy. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (C57BL/6J) were used as a model for diabetic retinopathy. Subcutaneous implantation of Alzet pump, loaded with Tacrolimus and Rapamycin, 5 days prior to intravitreal injection provided continuous systemic immunosuppression for the study duration to avoid rejection of human cells. Human CD34 + BMSCs were harvested from the mononuclear cell fraction of bone marrow from a healthy donor using magnetic beads. The CD34 + cells were labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) using a lentiviral vector. The right eye of each mouse received an intravitreal injection of 50,000 EGFP-labeled CD34 + BMSCs or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Simultaneous multimodal in vivo retinal imaging system consisting of fluorescent scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (enabling fluorescein angiography), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography was used to confirm the development of diabetic retinopathy and study the in vivo migration of the EGFP-labeled CD34 + BMSCs in the vitreous and retina following intravitreal injection. After imaging, the mice were euthanized, and the eyes were removed for immunohistochemistry. In addition, microarray analysis of the retina and retinal flat mount analysis of retinal vasculature were performed. The development of retinal microvascular changes consistent with diabetic retinopathy was visualized using fluorescein angiography and OCT angiography between 5 and 6 months after induction of diabetes in all diabetic mice. These retinal microvascular changes include areas of capillary nonperfusion and late leakage of fluorescein dye. Multimodal in vivo imaging and immunohistochemistry identified EGFP-labeled cells in the superficial retina and along retinal vasculature at 1 and 4 weeks following intravitreal cell injection. Microarray analysis showed changes in expression of 162 murine retinal genes following intravitreal CD34 + BMSC injection when compared to PBS-injected control. The major molecular pathways affected by intravitreal CD34 + BMSC injection in the murine retina included pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy including Toll-like receptor, MAP kinase, oxidative stress, cellular development, assembly and organization pathways. At 4 weeks following intravitreal injection, retinal flat mount analysis showed preservation of the retinal vasculature in eyes injected with CD34 + BMSCs when compared to PBS-injected control. The study findings support the hypothesis that intravitreal injection of human CD34 + BMSCs results in retinal homing and integration of these human cells with preservation of the retinal vasculature in murine eyes with diabetic retinopathy.",

METHOD: Acute ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced in the right eye of adult NOD-SCID mice (n = 23) by transient elevation of intraocular pressure. Seven days later, 12 injured eyes and 5 normal contralateral eyes were injected each intravitreally with 5 × 10(4) CD34(+) cells isolated under GMP conditions from a healthy human donor bone marrow using an immunomagnetic cell isolation system. The remaining 11 injured eyes were not treated and served as controls. Mice were euthanized 1 day, 4 months, and 8 months later. Both eyes were enucleated and examined by immunohistochemical analysis and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Among mice followed for 8 months, electroretinography (ERG) was performed on both eyes before euthanization. All major organs were examined grossly and histologically after serial sectioning. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining 4 months after injection showed detectable CD34(+) cells in the retinal vasculature. ERG at 8 months after CD34(+) cell injection showed signals that were similar in untreated eyes. Histology of the enucleated eyes injected with CD34(+) cells showed no intraocular tumor or abnormal tissue growth after 8 months. Histologic analysis of all major organs showed no abnormal proliferation of human cells. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal administration of GMP-grade human bone-marrow-derived CD34(+) cells appears to be well tolerated long-term in eyes with acute retinal ischemic injury. A clinical trial will start to further explore this therapy.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although the choroid contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the role of retinal perfusion is unclear. We sought to compare retinal vascular measurements between eyes with nonexudative and exudative AMD using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study. METHODS: OCT-A images were analyzed from 310 eyes of 182 patients (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 78.8 ± 8.8 years) with nonexudative (54.2%) and exudative (45.8%) AMD to measure retinal vessel density (VD) from the superficial capillary plexus in the foveal, parafoveal, and full macular regions and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, perimeter, and circularity. Multivariate regressions were used to compare nonexudative and exudative AMD eyes and the impact of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatments or geographic atrophy (GA). RESULTS: In eyes with AMD, VD decreases with age in the foveal (β = -0.211, P < .001), parafoveal (β = -0.305, P < .001), and full macular regions (β = -0.295, P < .001). Eyes with exudative AMD demonstrated lower VD, especially in the parafoveal (29.8% ± 6.3% vs 33.0% ± 5.7%, P < .001) and full regions (27.9% ± 6.2% vs 31.2% ± 5.5%, P < .001) compared with nonexudative AMD. There were no differences in FAZ area, perimeter, or circularity between the 2 groups (P = .503-.907). In eyes with exudative AMD, previous anti-VEGF treatments did not impact retinal vascular measurements (P = .324-.986). Nonexudative AMD severity and presence of central GA also impacted retinal VD and FAZ morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal VD is decreased in eyes with exudative AMD compared with nonexudative AMD but is unaffected by anti-VEGF treatments, suggesting a retinal vascular contribution to the pathogenesis of AMD.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the spectrum of retinal complications (RCs) in a cohort of eyes with a type 1 Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro). METHODS: All patients (36 eyes of 31 patients) who received a type 1 Boston KPro from January 2004 to December 2015 at the University of California, Davis, were included. Electronic medical records were reviewed for relevant clinical data. Demographic information, initial corneal diagnosis, postoperative course, posterior segment complications, preoperative and final visual acuity were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: Posterior segment complications after type 1 Boston KPro were identified in 56% of eyes (n = 20). They included retinal detachment (n = 11; 31%), retroprosthetic membrane (n = 10; 28%), endophthalmitis (n = 7; 19%), cystoid macular edema (n = 5; 14%), epiretinal membrane (n = 4; 11%), vitreous hemorrhage (n = 2; 6%), choroidal detachment (n = 2; 6%), retinal vein occlusion (n = 1; 3%), and macular hole (n = 1; 3%). During the average follow-up period of 53.8 months (median, 57.1 months; range, 1.8-108.7 months) after type 1 Boston KPro, final best-corrected visual acuity improved by a mean of 0.12 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) units (range, -2.26 to +2.26) overall. The proportion of eyes with final best-corrected visual acuity better than 20/200 was 2 of 20 (10%) in the group with RCs, in contrast to 7 of 16 eyes (44%) noted among eyes without RCs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term visual outcomes in eyes after type 1 Boston KPro may depend, in part, on maintaining a healthy posterior pole. Retinal detachment, in particular, may represent a threat to ultimate visual functioning. Regular examination of the peripheral fundus is recommended.",

Recent developments in X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM microscopy have revealed what these proteins look like in atomic detail but do not tell us how they function. Molecular dynamics simulations have progressed to the point that we can now simulate realistic molecular assemblies to produce quantitative calculations of the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities that control function. In this review, we summarize the state of atomistic simulation methods for ion channels to understand their conduction, activation, and drug modulation mechanisms. We are at a crossroads in atomistic simulation, where long time scale observation can provide unbiased exploration of mechanisms, supplemented by biased free energy methodologies. We illustrate the use of these approaches to describe ion conduction and selectivity in voltage-gated sodium and acid-sensing ion channels. Studies of channel gating present a significant challenge, as activation occurs on longer time scales. Enhanced sampling approaches can ensure convergence on minimum free energy pathways for activation, as illustrated here for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are principal to nervous system function and the actions of general anesthetics. We also examine recent studies of local anesthetic and antiepileptic drug binding to a sodium channel, revealing sites and pathways that may offer new targets for drug development. Modern simulations thus offer a range of molecular-level insights into ion channel function and modulation as a learning platform for mechanistic discovery and drug development.",

The advent of K+ and Na+ ion channel structure determination has facilitated numerous investigations of molecular determinants of their behaviour. At the same time, rapid development of computer hardware and molecular simulation methodologies has made computational studies of large biological molecules in all-atom representation tractable. The concurrent evolution of experimental structural biology with biomolecular computer modelling has yielded mechanistic details of fundamental processes unavailable through experiments alone, such as ion conduction and ion channel gating. This review is a short survey of the atomistic computational investigations of K+ and Na+ ion channels, focusing on KcsA and several voltage-gated channels from the KV and NaV families, which have garnered many successes and engendered several long-standing controversies regarding the nature of their structure-function relationship. We review the latest advancements and challenges facing the field of molecular modelling and simulation regarding the structural and energetic determinants of ion channel function and their agreement with experimental observations.",

In mammals, and particularly in humans, GPCRs are involved in many signal transduction pathways and, as such, are heavily studied for their immense pharmaceutical potential. Indeed, a large fraction of drugs target various GPCRs, and drug-development is often aimed at GPCRs. Therefore, understanding the activation of GPCRs is a challenge of major importance both from fundamental and practical considerations. And yet, despite the remarkable progress in structural understanding, we still do not have a translation of the structural information to an energy-based picture. Here we use coarse-grained (CG) modeling to chart the free-energy landscape of the activation process of the β-2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) as a representative GPCR. The landscape provides the needed tool for analyzing the processes that lead to activation of the receptor upon binding of the ligand (adrenaline) while limiting constitutive activation. Our results pave the way to better understand the biological mechanisms of action of the β2AR and GPCRs, from a physical chemistry point of view rather than simply by observing the receptor's behavior physiologically.",

However the advance in this direction has remained a major challenge for both experimental studies and molecular modeling. One of the possible directions is the use of coarse-grained models but such models must be carefully calibrated and validated. Here we use a recent progress in benchmark studies on the energetics of amino acid residue and peptide membrane insertion and membrane protein stability in refining our previously developed coarse-grained model (Vicatos et al., Proteins 2014;82:1168). Our refined model parameters were fitted and/or tested to reproduce water/membrane partitioning energetics of amino acid side chains and a couple of model peptides. This new model provides a reasonable agreement with experiment for absolute folding free energies of several β-barrel membrane proteins as well as effects of point mutations on a relative stability for one of those proteins, OmpLA. The consideration and ranking of different rotameric states for a mutated residue was found to be essential to achieve satisfactory agreement with the reference data.",

The recent solution of X-ray structures for the bacterial channel NavAb has provided an opportunity to study functional mechanisms at the atomic level. This channel's selectivity filter exhibits an EEEE ring sequence, characteristic of mammalian Ca(2+), not Na(+), channels. This raises the fundamentally important question: just what makes a Na(+) channel conduct Na(+) ions? Here we explore ion permeation on multimicrosecond timescales using the purpose-built Anton supercomputer. We isolate the likely protonation states of the EEEE ring and observe a striking flexibility of the filter that demonstrates the necessity for extended simulations to study conduction in this channel. We construct free energy maps to reveal complex multi-ion conduction via knock-on and \"pass-by\" mechanisms, involving concerted ion and glutamate side chain movements. Simulations in mixed ionic solutions reveal relative energetics for Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+) within the pore that are consistent with the modest selectivity seen experimentally. We have observed conformational changes in the pore domain leading to asymmetrical collapses of the activation gate, similar to proposed inactivated structures of NavAb, with helix bending involving conserved residues that are critical for slow inactivation. These structural changes are shown to regulate access to fenestrations suggested to be pathways for lipophilic drugs and provide deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms connecting drug activity and slow inactivation.",

        "abstract": "Data centers provide a volume of computation and storage resources for cloud-based services, and generate very huge traffic in data center networks. Usually, data centers are connected by ultra-long-haul WDM optical transport networks due to its advantages, such as high bandwidth, low latency, and low energy consumption. However, since the rigid bandwidth and coarse granularity, it shows inefficient spectrum utilization and inflexible accommodation of various types of traffic. Based on OFDM, a novel architecture named flexible grid optical network has been proposed, and becomes a promising technology in data center interconnections. In flexible grid optical networks, the assignment and management of spectrum resources are more flexible, and agile spectrum control and management strategies are needed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Spectrum Engineering, which could be used to maximize spectral efficiency in flexible grid optical networks. Spectrum Defragmentation, as one of the most important aspect in Spectrum Engineering, is demonstrated by OpenFlow in flexible grid optical networks. Experimental results are reported and verify the feasibility of Spectrum Engineering. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Elevated plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is often used to diagnose pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) in horses. The hormone naturally increases in the fall in horses, and donkeys have been found to have higher ACTH concentrations than horses. However, circannual variation of ACTH has not been assessed in donkeys. The objective of the study was to establish seasonal variation of basal plasma ACTH concentrations over the course of a year in clinically healthy, non-geriatric donkeys. It was hypothesized that donkey ACTH concentrations would be higher than those reported in horses without PPID in all seasons, and that, similarly to horses, ACTH concentrations would further increase in the fall months. Twenty-six healthy adult donkeys (10 standards, 16 miniatures), a median (range) of 6 (2-13) years of age, were included. Donkeys were housed at a single location. Serial plasma samples were obtained monthly for 12 months. Plasma ACTH concentrations were determined by immunoassay. Data are presented as median (range), with a P-value < 0.05 considered significant. ACTH concentrations were lowest in the winter and spring [12.8 (5.0-73.6) pg/ml and 12.5 (2.8-62.6) pg/ml, respectively], with an increase in the summer [53.2 (29.7-305.0) pg/ml], and peak in the fall [77.1 (12.4-319.0) pg/ml]. ACTH concentrations were highest in the month of September [122.0 (41.7-319.0) pg/ml]. Donkey ACTH concentrations were higher than equine reference ranges from May through November but showed similar circannual variation with dramatic increases in the fall months. Species-specific reference ranges are necessary for accurate interpretation of endocrinopathy screenings in donkeys.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lymphoma is the most common hemopoietic neoplasia in horses. Common clinicopathologic abnormalities in equine lymphoma include hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperfibrinogenemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and lymphocytosis. Hypoglobulinemia has been reported in other species with lymphoma, however it has not been well-described in horses. The objectives of this study were to examine the prevalence of hypoglobulinemia in equine lymphoma, and to identify prognosis and clinicopathological abnormalities associated with serum globulin concentrations. METHODS: Ninety-six horses with lymphoma were investigated in this retrospective study. Patients were allocated into groups based on serum globulin concentration. Survival analysis was performed to determine risk factors associated with globulin concentration and outcome. RESULTS: Nineteen horses were hypoglobulinemic (≤2.1 g/dL), 63/98 were normoglobulinemic (2.2-4.3 g/dL), and 16/98 were hyperglobulinemic (≥4.4 g/dL). Hyperglobulinemia was associated with a higher anion gap (P = 0.0005), lower bicarbonate (P = 0.006), sodium (P = 0.03) and chloride concentrations (P = 0.002), and higher total protein than hypoglobulinemic horses (P < 0.0001). For location, 37% of horses with mucocutaneous lymphoma were hypoglobulinemic, compared to none in the hyperglobulinemic group (P = 0.02). Survival times were significantly different between low, normal and high globulin groups (P = 0.0002, median [range] survival times: 333 [1-3792], 43 [1-4,001] and 4 [1-129] days, respectively). Significant risk factors for shortened time to death were hyperglobulinemia (HR 2.4, P = 0.02), T cell lymphoma (HR 3.5, P < 0.0001), and multicentric (HR 3.1, P = 0.0008) and mediastinal (HR 6.4, P = 0.006) forms of lymphoma. Lack of chemotherapy was associated with shortened survival time (HR 4.5, P < 0.0001). B cell lymphomas (P < 0.0001) and mucocutaneous lymphoma location (P < 0.0001) were associated with longer survival times. DISCUSSION: Serum globulin concentrations are associated with location of lymphoma, clinicopathologic abnormalities, and survival times in equine lymphoma.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The addition of calcium to resuscitation fluids is a common practice in horses, but studies evaluating the effects of calcium supplementation are limited. In healthy horses, decreases in heart rate and changes in serum electrolyte concentrations have been reported. HYPOTHESIS: Calcium gluconate administration at a rate of 0.4 mg/kg/min to eliminated endurance horses with metabolic problems will affect heart rate, gastrointestinal sounds, and serum electrolyte concentrations. ANIMALS: Endurance horses eliminated from the Tevis Cup 100-mile (160 km) endurance ride for metabolic problems and requiring IV fluid therapy were eligible. METHODS: Sixteen horses were randomly assigned to receive 0.4 mg/kg/min of calcium (23% calcium gluconate solution) over 1 hour diluted in 10 L of a non-calcium containing isotonic crystalloid (CAL group) or 10 L of a non-calcium containing isotonic crystalloid (CON group). Staff members administering the fluids were blinded to treatment group. Blood samples were collected and physical examinations performed before and after treatment. Heart rates were recorded every 15 min during fluid administration. Data were compared using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Calcium was associated with lower heart rates 45 min after starting the infusion (P = .002). Gastrointestinal sounds were less likely to improve in the calcium group compared with the control group (P = .005). An increase in plasma phosphorus concentration (P = .03) was associated with calcium administration. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous calcium supplementation to endurance horses eliminated from competition after development of metabolic problems may decrease heart rate but impairs improvement in gastrointestinal sounds.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution on the peak concentration (CMAX ) of amikacin in the radiocarpal joint (RCJ) during intravenous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP) compared with 0.9% NaCl. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized crossover study. ANIMALS: Seven healthy adult horses. METHODS: The horses underwent IVRLP with 2 g of amikacin sulfate diluted to 60 mL using a 10% DMSO or 0.9% NaCl solution. Synovial fluid was collected from the RCJ at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after IVRLP. The wide rubber tourniquet placed on the antebrachium was removed after the 30 min sample. Amikacin concentrations were quantified by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The mean CMAX and time to peak concentration (TMAX ) of amikacin within the RCJ were determined. A one-sided paired t-test was used to determine the differences between treatments. The significance level was p < .05. RESULTS: The mean ± SD CMAX in the DMSO group was 1361.8 ± 593 μg/mL and in the 0.9% NaCl group it was 860 ± 481.6 μg/mL (p = .058). Mean TMAX using the 10% DMSO solution was 23 and 18 min using the 0.9% NaCl perfusate (p = .161). No adverse effects were associated with use of the 10% DMSO solution. CONCLUSION: Although there were higher mean peak synovial concentrations using the 10% DMSO solution no difference in synovial amikacin CMAX between perfusate type was detected (p = .058). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Use of a 10% DMSO solution in conjunction with amikacin during IVRLP is a feasible technique and does not negatively affect the synovial amikacin levels achieved. Further research is warranted to determine other effects of using DMSO during IVRLP.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe a population of horses with acute kidney injury (AKI) following administration of bisphosphonates including clinical signs, clinicopathologic data, treatment, and outcome. DESIGN: Retrospective study from August 2013 to July 2020. SETTING: Veterinary university teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Eight adult horses with AKI following administration of nonnitrogenous bisphosphonates. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five horses received intramuscular clodronate (5/8; 62.5%) and 3 horses received intravenous tiludronate (3/8; 37.5%). Six horses (6/8; 75%) received concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The most common initial presenting complaint was poor appetite (6/8; 75%), followed by abnormal urination (2/8; 25%). At the time of initial evaluation, the mean serum or plasma creatinine was 451.72 ± 190.06 μmol/L (5.11 ± 2.15 mg/dL) and BUN was 18.84 ± 8.85 mmol/L (52.75 ± 24.77 mg/dL). Five horses (5/6; 83.3%) had either an increased number of red blood cells (n = 4) or hemoprotein (n = 1) in the urine. All horses were treated with IV isotonic, balanced crystalloids either as a bolus, continuous rate infusion, or a combination of the 2. Seven horses (7/8; 87.5%) survived the initial episode of AKI and 1 horse (1/8; 12.5%) was euthanized. Of the 7 surviving horses, 2 horses (2/7; 28.5%) went on to develop chronic renal dysfunction. Warmblood breeds were overrepresented in the AKI group (P = 0.008; odds ratio: 11.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-72.1), when compared to horses that received bisphosphonates during the study period and did not develop AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonate administration, with or without concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can be associated with AKI in horses. Serum creatinine should be monitored prior to and following bisphosphonate treatment to minimize this risk. Further evaluation of renal function is warranted in horses that develop clinical signs of poor appetite, lethargy, or altered urination in the days following bisphosphonate treatment.",

        "abstract": "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) [extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)] is a key technique within the heterogeneous catalysis community to probe the structure and properties of the active site(s) for a diverse range of catalytic materials. However, the interpretation of the raw experimental data to derive an atomistic picture of the catalyst requires modeling and analysis; the EXAFS data are compared to a model, and a goodness of fit parameter is used to judge the best fit. This EXAFS modeling can often be nontrivial and time-consuming; overcoming or improving these limitations remains a central challenge for the community. Considering these limitations, this Perspective highlights how recent developments in analysis software, increased availability of reliable computational models, and application of data science tools can be used to improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of EXAFS interpretation. In particular, we emphasize the advantages of combining theory and EXAFS as a unified technique that should be treated as a standard (when applicable) to identify catalytic sites and not two separate complementary methods. Building on the recent trends in the computational catalysis community, we also present a community-driven approach to adopt FAIR Guiding Principles for the collection, analysis, dissemination, and storage of XAS data. Written with both the experimental and theory audience in mind, we provide a unified roadmap to foster collaborations between the two communities.",

        "abstract": "Propene and 1,3-butadiene are important building-block chemicals that can be produced by dehydrogenation of propane and butane on Pt catalysts. A challenge is to develop highly active and selective catalysts that are resistant to deactivation by Pt sintering and coke formation. We have recently shown (Qi et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 21364-21378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA. In the present study, we demonstrate that significantly superior performance can be achieved using self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets as supports. Following catalyst reduction in H2, atomic resolution, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicate that Pt is stabilized in structures well approximated as (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt. These species are highly active, selective, and stable for PDH to give propene and for n-butane dehydrogenation (BDH) to give 1,3-butadiene. No catalyst deactivation was observed after 12 days of time on stream, and the selectivity remained at nearly 100% for PDH conducted at 823 K and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1350 h-1. The apparent rate coefficient for PDH on this catalyst is significantly higher than that reported previously for Pt-containing catalysts. For BDH at 823 K and a WHSV of 3560 h-1, the selectivity to butene isomers and 1,3-butadiene is 98.9%, and the selectivity to 1,3-butadiene is 45%. We propose that the high catalyst stability observed during PDH and BDH is a consequence of a large fraction of the Pt-containing centers being located on the external surface of the zeolite nanosheets, where nascent coke precursors can desorb before condensing to form coke.",

Continuous-scan X-ray absorption spectra demonstrate the formation of clusters well approximated as Ir4 during reaction at 100 °C in flowing equimolar ethylene and H2. The Ir4 clusters transformed into clusters well approximated as Ir6 when the feed molar ratio was switched to H2:C2H4 = 2 and remained stable in pure H2 at 100 °C. Catalyst performance data show that hydrogenation activity increased with metal nuclearity in the order of atomically dispersed iridium/rGA≪ Ir4/rGA < Ir6/rGA. Continuous scan X-ray absorption data, complemented with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy images, demonstrate that the supported clusters approximated as Ir6 are stable even in H2 at atmospheric pressure and 100 °C. These supported iridium clusters are among the ones having the highest metal loadings reported for a supported metal cluster catalyst.",

Continuous-scan X-ray absorption spectra demonstrated that the iridium remained site-isolated in flowing equimolar C2H4 and H2 during a temperature ramp to 100 °C. The data further showed the lack of detectable iridium aggregation when the feed was H2-rich or even pure H2 at 100 °C. An Arrhenius plot determined for ethylene hydrogenation catalysis with the sample in flowing equimolar ethylene and hydrogen showed no variation in the apparent activation energy at temperatures up to 100 °C, confirming that the active sites remained intact at the higher temperatures. The results point to opportunities for overcoming the stability limitations of atomically dispersed supported noble metal catalysts by choice of electron-donor supports and ionic liquid sheaths.",

        "abstract": "Catalysts composed of platinum dispersed on zeolite supports are widely applied in industry, and coking and sintering of platinum during operation under reactive conditions require their oxidative regeneration, with the platinum cycling between clusters and cations. The intermediate platinum species have remained only incompletely understood. Here, we report an experimental and theoretical investigation of the structure, bonding, and local environment of cationic platinum species in zeolite ZSM-5, which are key intermediates in this cycling. Upon exposure of platinum clusters to O2 at 700 °C, oxidative fragmentation occurs, and Pt2+ ions are stabilized at six-membered rings in the zeolite that contain paired aluminum sites. When exposed to CO under mild conditions, these Pt2+ ions form highly uniform platinum gem-dicarbonyls, which can be converted in H2 to Ptδ+ monocarbonyls. This conversion, which weakens the platinum-zeolite bonding, is a first step toward platinum migration and aggregation into clusters. X-ray absorption and infrared spectra provide evidence of the reductive and oxidative transformations in various gas environments. The chemistry is general, as shown by the observation of platinum gem-dicarbonyls in several commercially used zeolites (ZSM-5, Beta, mordenite, and Y).",

The broad host range of the genus contrasts with stringent host and tissue specificity for individual species and pathovars. Whole-genome sequences of Xanthomonas campestris pv. raphani strain 756C and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strain BLS256, pathogens that infect the mesophyll tissue of the leading models for plant biology, Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, respectively, were determined and provided insight into the genetic determinants of host and tissue specificity. Comparisons were made with genomes of closely related strains that infect the vascular tissue of the same hosts and across a larger collection of complete Xanthomonas genomes. The results suggest a model in which complex sets of adaptations at the level of gene content account for host specificity and subtler adaptations at the level of amino acid or noncoding regulatory nucleotide sequence determine tissue specificity.",

We produced more than 580 million RNA-Seq reads to facilitate expression analyses. We also sequenced Setaria viridis, the ancestral wild relative of S. italica, and identified regions of differential single-nucleotide polymorphism density, distribution of transposable elements, small RNA content, chromosomal rearrangement and segregation distortion. The genus Setaria includes natural and cultivated species that demonstrate a wide capacity for adaptation. The genetic basis of this adaptation was investigated by comparing five sequenced grass genomes. We also used the diploid Setaria genome to evaluate the ongoing genome assembly of a related polyploid, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).",

        "abstract": "The rice XA21-mediated immune response is activated on recognition of the RaxX peptide produced by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The 60-residue RaxX precursor is post-translationally modified to form a sulfated tyrosine peptide that shares sequence and functional similarity with the plant sulfated tyrosine (PSY) peptide hormones. The 5-kb raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster of Xoo encodes RaxX, the RaxST tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, and the RaxA and RaxB components of a predicted type I secretion system. To assess raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster evolution and to determine its phylogenetic distribution, we first identified rax gene homologues in other genomes. We detected the complete raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster only in Xanthomonas spp., in five distinct lineages in addition to X. oryzae. The phylogenetic distribution of the raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster is consistent with the occurrence of multiple lateral (horizontal) gene transfer events during Xanthomonas speciation. RaxX natural variants contain a restricted set of missense substitutions, as expected if selection acts to maintain peptide hormone-like function. Indeed, eight RaxX variants tested all failed to activate the XA21-mediated immune response, yet retained peptide hormone activity. Together, these observations support the hypothesis that the XA21 receptor evolved specifically to recognize Xoo RaxX.",

Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods were used from optimal alignments and those filtered for alignment ambiguity. Analysis of 30 ingroup sequences using ribosomal DNA sequences yielded a single most parsimonious tree. Monophyly of the Metastrongyloidea was supported, but there was no support for monophyly of any of the 7 families as they have been traditionally defined. Parafilaroides decorus, an abursate lungworm of pinnipeds currently classified in the Filaroididae, was nested within a clade containing members of the Pseudaliidae, parasites of cetaceans. The tree also shows clades somewhat resembling the traditional familial divisions of the Metastrongyloidea, but in all groups, paraphyletic relationships were recovered. In a combined analysis of nuclear rDNA and 12S mtDNA, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses showed similar patterns to those observed with only nuclear rDNA sequences. Based on the phylogeny, the respiratory tract was inferred to be the ancestral predilection site for Metastrongyloidea, with multiple evolutionary invasions of extrapulmonary sites such as sinuses, circulatory system, and meninges. Similarly, the ancestral host was inferred to be a carnivore with subsequent colonization events into marsupial, rodent, artiodactyl, pinniped, and cetacean hosts.",

Intraerythrocytic gamonts were contained within a parasitophorous vacuole. An electron‐lucid space observed between the gamont pellicle and the membrane of the vacuole corresponded to the unstained space described in light microscopy studies. Gamonts possessed a conoid, polar ring, subpellicular microtubules, four pairs of rhoptries, micronemes, ovoid granules, mitochondria with tubular cristae, and a pellicle composed of three individual unit membranes. The conoid had an anterior diameter of 320 nm, a posterior diameter of 360 nm, and a length of 150 nm. In contrast to a report on Hepatozoon aegypti, no micropore or “canopy‐like structure” was observed. The plasmalemma of infected erythrocytes exhibited two types of modifications: gross membrane deformations and knobs with an electron‐dense central mass. These knobs are structurally distinct from previously described membrane excrescences. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",

        "abstract": "A molecular phylogenetic hypothesis is presented for the genus Trichuris based on sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) and ribosomal 18S genes. The taxa consisted of different described species and several host-associated isolates (undescribed taxa) of Trichuris collected from hosts from Spain. Sequence data from mitochondrial cox1 (partial gene) and nuclear 18S near-complete gene were analyzed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods, as separate and combined datasets, to evaluate phylogenetic relationships among taxa. Phylogenetic results based on 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were robust for relationships among species; cox1 sequences delimited species and revealed phylogeographic variation, but most relationships among Trichuris species were poorly resolved by mitochondrial sequences. The phylogenetic hypotheses for both genes strongly supported monophyly of Trichuris, and distinct genetic lineages corresponding to described species or nematodes associated with certain hosts were recognized based on cox1 sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on concatenated sequences of the two loci, cox1 (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)) and 18S rDNA, were congruent with the overall topology inferred from 18S and previously published results based on internal transcribed spacer sequences. Our results demonstrate that the 18S rDNA and cox1 mtDNA genes provide resolution at different levels, but together resolve relationships among geographic populations and species in the genus Trichuris.",

        "abstract": "We searched a database of single-gene knockout (KO) mice produced by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) to identify candidate ciliopathy genes. We first screened for phenotypes in mouse lines with both ocular and renal or reproductive trait abnormalities. The STRING protein interaction tool was used to identify interactions between known cilia gene products and those encoded by the genes in individual knockout mouse strains in order to generate a list of \"candidate ciliopathy genes.\" From this list, 32 genes encoded proteins predicted to interact with known ciliopathy proteins. Of these, 25 had no previously described roles in ciliary pathobiology. Histological and morphological evidence of phenotypes found in ciliopathies in knockout mouse lines are presented as examples (genes Abi2, Wdr62, Ap4e1, Dync1li1, and Prkab1). Phenotyping data and descriptions generated on IMPC mouse line are useful for mechanistic studies, target discovery, rare disease diagnosis, and preclinical therapeutic development trials. Here we demonstrate the effective use of the IMPC phenotype data to uncover genes with no previous role in ciliary biology, which may be clinically relevant for identification of novel disease genes implicated in ciliopathies.",

Anecdotal evidence suggests that their disruption may interfere with normal gene expression and cause disease phenotypes1-3, but the overall extent to which this occurs remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that targeted deletions of TAD boundaries cause a range of disruptions to normal in vivo genome function and organismal development. We used CRISPR genome editing in mice to individually delete eight TAD boundaries (11-80 kb in size) from the genome. All deletions examined resulted in detectable molecular or organismal phenotypes, which included altered chromatin interactions or gene expression, reduced viability, and anatomical phenotypes. We observed changes in local 3D chromatin architecture in 7 of 8 (88%) cases, including the merging of TADs and altered contact frequencies within TADs adjacent to the deleted boundary. For 5 of 8 (63%) loci examined, boundary deletions were associated with increased embryonic lethality or other developmental phenotypes. For example, a TAD boundary deletion near Smad3/Smad6 caused complete embryonic lethality, while a deletion near Tbx5/Lhx5 resulted in a severe lung malformation. Our findings demonstrate the importance of TAD boundary sequences for in vivo genome function and reinforce the critical need to carefully consider the potential pathogenicity of noncoding deletions affecting TAD boundaries in clinical genetics screening.",

        "abstract": "Genome editing with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins holds exceptional promise for \"correcting\" variants causing genetic disease. To realize this promise, off-target genomic changes cannot occur during the editing process. Here, we use whole genome sequencing to compare the genomes of 50 Cas9-edited founder mice to 28 untreated control mice to assess the occurrence of S. pyogenes Cas9-induced off-target mutagenesis. Computational analysis of whole-genome sequencing data detects 26 unique sequence variants at 23 predicted off-target sites for 18/163 guides used. While computationally detected variants are identified in 30% (15/50) of Cas9 gene-edited founder animals, only 38% (10/26) of the variants in 8/15 founders validate by Sanger sequencing. In vitro assays for Cas9 off-target activity identify only two unpredicted off-target sites present in genome sequencing data. In total, only 4.9% (8/163) of guides tested have detectable off-target activity, a rate of 0.2 Cas9 off-target mutations per founder analyzed. In comparison, we observe ~1,100 unique variants in each mouse regardless of genome exposure to Cas9 indicating off-target variants comprise a small fraction of genetic heterogeneity in Cas9-edited mice. These findings will inform future design and use of Cas9-edited animal models as well as provide context for evaluating off-target potential in genetically diverse patient populations.",

        "abstract": "The biomedical research community addresses reproducibility challenges in animal studies through standardized nomenclature, improved experimental design, transparent reporting, data sharing, and centralized repositories. The ARRIVE guidelines outline documentation standards for laboratory animals in experiments, but genetic information is often incomplete. To remedy this, we propose the Laboratory Animal Genetic Reporting (LAG-R) framework. LAG-R aims to document animals' genetic makeup in scientific publications, providing essential details for replication and appropriate model use. While verifying complete genetic compositions may be impractical, better reporting and validation efforts enhance reliability of research. LAG-R standardization will bolster reproducibility, peer review, and overall scientific rigor.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to better define the clinical features and outcomes of young patients with non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) with regional and distant lymph node (LN) metastases treated in a standardised fashion, we analysed LN involvement in COG study ARST0332, which evaluated a risk-based treatment strategy for young patients with all stages of NRSTS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients <30 years old with newly diagnosed NRSTS and LN metastases enrolled on ARST0332 were studied. Regional LN sampling was required for those with epithelioid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma or clinically/radiographically enlarged LNs. Tumour features and extent of pre-enrolment resection determined treatment, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and delayed surgery. Recommendations for LN metastases included LN dissection at the time of primary tumour resection and dose-adapted radiotherapy based on extent of LN resection. RESULTS: Twenty of 529 eligible and evaluable ARST0332 patients with NRSTS had LN metastases; epithelioid sarcoma had the highest incidence (18%, 5 of 28). Pre-treatment imaging identified LN enlargement in 19 of 20 patients; 1 had no pre-treatment LN imaging. At 6.9 years median follow-up for surviving patients, 5-year overall survival was 85.7% (95% CI: 33.4%, 97.9%) for seven patients with isolated LN metastases and 15.4% (95% CI: 2.5%, 38.8%) for 13 patients with additional extranodal metastases. LN recurrence occurred in only one patient without LNs sampled at initial diagnosis. CONCLUSION: LN metastases occur in about 4% of paediatric/young adult NRSTS, are limited to a few histologic subtypes, and are rare in patients who did not have clinical or imaging evidence of lymphadenopathy, suggesting that biopsies of non-enlarged LNs are not necessary to identify occult involvement. Patients with isolated LN metastases have high 5-year overall survival (∼85%) and should be treated with curative intent. GOV REGISTRY NO: NCT00346164.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies of adolescent and young adult (AYA) oncology end-of-life care utilization are critical because cancer is the leading cause of nonaccidental AYA death and end-of-life care contributes significantly to health care expenditures. This study was designed to determine the quantity of and disparities in inpatient utilization in the last year of life of AYAs with cancer. METHODS: The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development administrative discharge database, linked to death certificates, was used to perform a population-based analysis of cancer patients aged 15 to 39 years who died in 2000-2011. The number of hospital days and the inpatient costs were determined for each patient in the last year of his or her life, as were clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with high inpatient utilization. Admission patterns as death approached were also evaluated. RESULTS: The 12,883 patients were admitted for 40 days on average in the last year of life, and this cost $151,072 per patient in inpatient costs. As death approached, the admission rates and the percentage of all admissions occurring at nonspecialty centers increased. Five percent of patients used 20% of bed days in the last year (high utilizers). Factors associated with high utilization included younger age (15-30 years), Hispanic ethnicity, non-health maintenance organization insurance, and hematologic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: AYA oncology decedents were admitted for 40 days in their last year of life. Subgroups with high utilization had distinct sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and nonspecialty center admissions increased as death approached. This demonstrates the need for palliative care at nonspecialty centers. Future studies need to determine whether these patterns are goal-concurrent, include high utilizers, and monitor the effects of health care reform.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cancer is the leading cause of nonaccidental death among adolescents and young adults (AYAs). High-intensity end-of-life care is expensive and may not be consistent with patient goals. However, the intensity of end-of-life care for AYA decedents with cancer-especially the effect of care received at specialty versus nonspecialty centers-remains understudied. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based analysis with the California administrative discharge database that is linked to death certificates. The cohort included Californians age 15 to 39 years who died between 2000 and 2011 with cancer. Intense end-of-life interventions included readmission, admission to an intensive care unit, intubation in the last month of life, and in-hospital death. Specialty centers were defined as Children's Oncology Group centers and National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers. RESULTS: Of the 12,938 AYA cancer decedents, 59% received at least one intense end-of-life care intervention, and 30% received two or more. Patients treated at nonspecialty centers were more likely than those at specialty-care centers to receive two or more intense interventions (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.62). Sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with two or more intense interventions included minority race/ethnicity (Black [OR, 1.35, 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.56]; Hispanic [OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.36]; non-Hispanic white: reference), younger age (15 to 21 years [OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.56; 22 to 29 years [OR,1.26; 95% CI,1.14 to 1.39]; ≥ 30 years: reference), and hematologic malignancies (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.66; solid tumors: reference). CONCLUSION: Thirty percent of AYA cancer decedents received two or more high-intensity end-of-life interventions. In addition to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, hospitalization in a nonspecialty center was associated with high-intensity end-of-life care. Additional research is needed to determine if these disparities are consistent with patient preference.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many adult patients with cancer who know they are dying choose less intense care; additionally, high-intensity care is associated with worse caregiver outcomes. Little is known about intensity of end-of-life care in children with cancer. METHODS: By using the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development administrative database, we performed a population-based analysis of patients with cancer aged 0 to 21 who died between 2000 and 2011. Rates of and sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with previously-defined end-of-life intensity indicators were determined. The intensity indicators included an intense medical intervention (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, ICU admission, or hemodialysis) within 30 days of death, intravenous chemotherapy within 14 days of death, and hospital death. RESULTS: The 3732 patients were 34% non-Hispanic white, and 41% had hematologic malignancies. The most prevalent intensity indicators were hospital death (63%) and ICU admission (20%). Sixty-five percent had ≥1 intensity indicator, 23% ≥2, and 22% ≥1 intense medical intervention. There was a bimodal association between age and intensity: ages <5 years and 15 to 21 years was associated with intense care. Patients with hematologic malignancies were more likely to have high-intensity end-of-life care, as were patients from underrepresented minorities, those who lived closer to the hospital, those who received care at a nonspecialty center (neither Children's Oncology Group nor National Cancer Institute Designated Cancer Center), and those receiving care after 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly two-thirds of children who died of cancer experienced intense end-of-life care. Further research needs to determine if these rates and disparities are consistent with patient and/or family goals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ideally, quality indicators are developed with the input of professional groups involved in the care of patients. This project, led by the Thoracic Oncology Network and Quality Improvement Committee of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), had the goal of developing quality indicators related to the evaluation and staging of patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Evidence-based guidelines were used to generate a list of process-of-care quality indicators, and project members revised the content and wording of this list. A survey of the Steering Committee of the Thoracic Oncology Network was performed to rate the validity, feasibility, and relevance of the indicators. Predefined thresholds were used to select indicators from the list. This process was repeated for the selected indicators through a survey available to all members of the Thoracic Oncology Network. Three academic medical centers determined if the surviving indicators were feasible and relevant within their practices. RESULTS: Eighteen quality indicators were drafted. Eleven survived the first round of voting, and seven survived the second round of voting. One was related to tissue acquisition for molecular testing, four were related to staging and stage documentation, one was related to smoking cessation counseling, and one was related to documentation of a performance status measure. The indicators were feasible and relevant within the practices assessed. CONCLUSIONS: We have defined seven process-of-care quality indicators related to the evaluation and staging of patients with lung cancer, which are felt to be valid, feasible, and relevant by lung cancer specialists.",

This study compares the results of EG before and after implementation of a perioperative clinical care process including a health provider education program (EP) and institutional uncomplicated postoperative clinical pathway (POP) for purpose quality improvement. This is a single institution retrospective cohort study. The EP was provided to critical care and telemetry unit nurses and the POP was imbedded in the electronic health record. Patients undergoing elective EG with reconstruction with the stomach for benign disease or cancer were included from 2005 to 2011. Cohorts were pre- and postimplementation (PreI and PostI) of an EP and 8-day POP (August 2008). Patient, tumor and peri/postoperative-specific variables were compared between cohorts, as well as resource utilization and hospital costs. We identified 33 PreI and 41 PostI patients. Both cohorts had similar patient demographics, preoperative comorbidities, majority cancer diagnosis, and for cancer patients, majority adenocarcinoma and IIB/III pathologic stage. Both groups had one death and similar rate of discharge to home. The PostI cohort demonstrated reduced 30-day readmission rate (2.4% vs 24.2%); P &lt; 0.05. In regard to clinical outcomes, the PostI group exhibited reduced deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary emboli (2.4% vs 18.2%); P &lt; 0.05. The PostI group demonstrated significantly reduced radiographic test utilization and costs, as well as total overall 30-day readmission costs. A defined perioperative clinical process involving educating the patient care team and implementing a widely disseminated POP can reduce complications, 30-day readmission rates, and hospital costs after EG. </jats:p>",

ANIMALS: A group of six healthy adult male neutered cats. METHODS: Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. Catheters were placed in a jugular vein for blood sampling and in a medial saphenous vein for buprenorphine and lactated Ringer's solution administration. Buprenorphine hydrochloride (40 μg kg-1 over 5 minutes) was administered intravenously. Blood samples were collected before buprenorphine administration and at various times up to 12 hours after administration. Plasma buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Compartment models were fitted to the time-concentration data using nonlinear mixed effect (population) modeling. RESULTS: A five-compartment model (three compartments for buprenorphine and two compartments for norbuprenorphine) best fitted the data. Typical value (% interindividual variability) for the three buprenorphine volumes of distribution, and the metabolic clearance to norbuprenorphine, the remaining metabolic clearance and the two distribution clearances were 157 (33), 759 (34) and 1432 (43) mL kg-1, and 5.3 (33), 16.4 (11), 58.7 (27) and 6.0 (not estimated) mL minute-1 kg-1, respectively.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of pecto-intercostal fascial plane block on providing intraoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing median sternotomy. ANIMALS: 4 dogs. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The dogs were presented with a history of inappetence, lethargy and respiratory distress. Thoracic radiographs, point of care ultrasound, thoracocentesis, bronchoscopy and computed tomography was performed to characterize the disease. RESULTS: 4 male castrated, 5.3 ± 3 years old dogs weighing 19.7 ± 13.5 kg and belonging to Dalmatian, Beagle, Siberian Husky and Rottweiler breeds were included. Three dogs were diagnosed with suppurative pleural effusions because of pulmonary abscesses and one dog with spontaneous pneumothorax due to the presence of pulmonary bullae. All dogs underwent median sternotomy under general anesthesia to explore the thorax. A pecto-intercostal fascial plane block was performed by injecting local anesthetic bupivacaine in the parasternal fascial plane between the deep pectoral and external intercostal muscles to provide antinociception by anesthetizing ventral cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves second through sixth. Analgesia from the block resulted in reduced requirement of inhalant anesthesia and minimal requirement for opioid to augment analgesia intraoperatively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Median sternotomy is required to perform thoracic surgery in dogs with various thoracic pathologies. Pecto-intercostal fascial plane block is a locoregional technique that can blunt nociception arising from the ventral thorax and can significantly improve perioperative patient care in dogs undergoing median sternotomy by providing effective intraoperative and potentially postoperative analgesia.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe an ultrasound-guided suprazygomatic approach to the trigeminal nerve block in cat cadavers. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study. ANIMALS: Ten feline cadaver heads. METHODS: A 25:75 methylene blue-iopamidol mixture (0.1 mL cm-1 cranium length) was injected into 10 cadaver heads using an ultrasound-guided suprazygomatic approach. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to identify contrast presence at the orbital fissure, foramen rotundum and ovale, followed by anatomical dissection to identify staining of the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF), extraconal retrobulbar area, mandibular and maxillary nerves. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize results. RESULTS: A total of 20 injections were performed. Of these, 1/20 misinjection occurred and excluded from further reporting. The volume of injectate was 0.9 (0.9-1.1) mL [median (range)]. Staining of the PPF, extraconal space, maxillary and mandibular nerves over more than 6 mm was achieved in 19/19 (100%), 18/19 (95%), 17/19 (89%) and 19/19 (100%) of injections, respectively. CT showed presence of contrast within 5 mm of the orbital fissure, foramen rotundum and ovale in 18/19 (95%), 19/19 (100%) and 19/19 (100%) of the injections, respectively. No intracranial migration was observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This cadaver study illustrates that the suprazygomatic ultrasound-guided trigeminal nerve injection technique can successfully stain the PPF, retrobulbar cone extraconally, mandibular and maxillary nerves. Consequently, this technique has the potential to be used in vivo in cats to desensitize areas innervated by the trigeminal nerve.",

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. ANIMALS: A group of six healthy male neutered cats, aged 2-8 years and weighing 5.3 ± 0.3 kg. METHODS: Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. CO was measured by PATD (COPATD) and transthoracic echocardiography (COECHO). ABF MD was measured using an esophageal Doppler flow probe aligned with descending ABF. All measurements were made under three conditions: dexmedetomidine (20 μg kg-1) intravenously; atipamezole (200 μg kg-1) intramuscularly and atropine (20 μg kg-1) intravenously as needed to achieve a minimum heart rate of 140 beats minute-1; and dopamine (20 μg kg-1 minute-1) intravenously in that order. Correlation between COPATD and COECHO, and COPATD and Doppler MD was evaluated using repeated measures correlation. Agreement between COPATD and COECHO was evaluated using Bland-Altman method. Differences between consecutive pairs of CO measurements were calculated for concordance analysis. RESULTS: Correlation between COPATD and COECHO and between COPATD and MD was significant (p < 0.001), with correlation coefficients greater than 0.92. A bias of > 27% and upper limits of agreement of 66% were found between COPATD and COECHO. Concordance rate with COPATD was 76-80% for COECHO and 72% for MD. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Echocardiographic methods for the measurement of CO showed poor agreement and concordance with PATD. MD showed poor concordance with PATD. As such, these methods cannot be used as an alternative to PATD nor can they appropriately track changes in CO in anesthetized cats.",

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, crossover, experimental study. ANIMALS: A group of six healthy male neutered cats, aged 2-8 years with body mass 5.0 ± 0.3 kg. METHODS: The MACiso had been determined in each cat in a previous study. Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. Catheters were placed in a medial saphenous vein for drug and fluid administration and in a jugular vein for blood sampling. Buprenorphine was administered intravenously using a target-controlled infusion system to reach and maintain plasma concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng mL-1, and MACiso was determined in duplicate at each concentration using the tail clamp technique. Four target plasma buprenorphine concentrations were administered on each study day, with at least 2 weeks between experiments. Blood was sampled after the second MAC determination at each target for determination of plasma buprenorphine concentration. RESULTS: A significant effect of buprenorphine on MAC was found; however, pairwise comparisons to MACiso without buprenorphine did not reach statistical significance. Maximum reduction in MACiso in individual cats ranged from 2% to 34% at plasma buprenorphine concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 8.15 ng mL-1. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although buprenorphine significantly affected MACiso in cats, the magnitude of the effect and the plasma concentration at which the largest effect occurred was highly variable among cats, limiting the clinical usefulness of buprenorphine as an agent to reduce MAC in cats.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) has created difficulty in identifying certain procedures, including pancreaticoduodenectomy. We sought to evaluate which combinations of ICD-10-PCS codes best identify pancreaticoduodenectomy. STUDY DESIGN: We used 2017-2018 Medicare data to identify acute care hospitalization claims of beneficiaries with both ICD-10-PCS and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes available. We developed 12 candidate ICD-10-PCS definitions of pancreaticoduodenectomy and evaluated their test characteristics in identifying hospitalizations involving CPT codes 48150, 48152, 48153, 48154, or 48155 as the criterion standard. We selected one candidate definition with the best balance of test characteristics, then performed decision tree analysis and evaluated the conditional marginal sensitivity and positive predictive value of each individual code to understand which were most informative. RESULTS: Among 964,613 hospitalization claims from 4648 hospitals, 385 claims from 217 hospitals involved a CPT code for pancreaticoduodenectomy. The ICD-10-PCS definition with the best balance had a sensitivity of 92.2% (95% CI: 89.2%-94.4%), specificity of 99.9977% (95% CI: 99.9961%-99.9984%), positive predictive value of 93.7% (95% CI: 90.3%-95.9%), and negative predictive value of 99.9969% (95% CI: 99.9955%-99.9978%). The most informative procedure codes involved open nondiagnostic excision or resection of the duodenum (0DB90ZZ and 0DT90ZZ) and pancreas (0FBG0ZZ and 0FTG0ZZ). CONCLUSION: An ICD-10-PCS definition of pancreaticoduodenectomy using codes for (1) open or percutaneous endoscopic excision or resection of the pancreas and (2) similar codes for the duodenum, consistent with coding guidelines, has satisfactory test characteristics. We suggest researchers consider such characteristics in defining pancreaticoduodenectomy using ICD-10-PCS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) has developed a new grading system for uniform description of anatomic severity of emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases, ranging from Grade I (mild) to Grade V (severe). The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of AAST grades for acute colonic diverticulitis with patient outcomes. A secondary purpose was to propose an EGS quality improvement program using risk-adjusted center outcomes, similar to National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and Trauma Quality Improvement Program methodologies. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 1,105 patients (one death) from 13 centers. At each center, two reviewers (blinded to each other's assignments) assigned AAST grades. Interrater reliability was measured using κ coefficient. Relationship between AAST grade and clinical events (complications, intensive care unit use, surgical intervention, and 30-day readmission) as well as length of stay was measured using regression analyses to control for age, comorbidities, and physiologic status at the time of admission. Final model was also used to calculate observed-to-expected (O-E) ratios for adverse outcomes (death, complications, readmissions) for each center. RESULTS: Median age was 54 years, 52% were males, 43% were minorities, and 22% required a surgical intervention. Almost two thirds had Grade I or II disease. There was a high level of agreement for grades between reviewers (κ = 0.81). Adverse events increased from 13% for Grade I, to 18% for Grade II, 28% for Grade III, 44% for Grade IV, and 50% for Grade V. Regression analysis showed that higher disease grades were independently associated with all clinical events and length of stay, after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and physiology. O-E ratios showed statistically insignificant variations in risk of death, complications, or readmissions. CONCLUSION: AAST grades for acute colonic diverticulitis are independently associated with clinical outcomes and resource use. EGS quality improvement program methodology that incorporates AAST grade, age, comorbidities, and physiologic status may be used for measuring quality of EGS care. High-quality EGS registries are essential for developing meaningful quality metrics. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic study, level V.",

        "issued": "2006-11",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The characterization of microchimerism (MC) by gene amplification has been limited by few allogeneic markers, ascertainment bias, and assay analytic performance. To address this, a panel of 12 MC assays based on insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms had been optimized. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The InDel assays were validated with comprehensive in vitro spiking studies at the stochastic limit of detection. Their ability was also determined to ascertain MC of unknown source genotype with both theoretical and actual donor-recipient pairs, and the assays were applied to a clinical population of 73 trauma patients who received transfusions where MC was previously characterized by HLA-based assays alone. RESULTS: In the stochastic spiking experiments, all assays were sensitive to a single copy of target DNA, and no false-positive amplification occurred among 1128 samples studied. Among 219 theoretical donor-recipient pairs, informative alleles existed for 99.5 percent with both InDel and HLA compared to 91.3 percent with HLA alone. In the clinical population, 33 cases of MC were detected (9 more cases than by HLA-DR alone) in the nonleukoreduced (non-LR) group and 8 cases (1 more case than by HLA-DR) in the LR group for the short-term follow-up. Among 27 long-term follow-up samples, 8 cases were detected overall (3 more cases than by HLA-DR alone). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an InDel-based assay panel has excellent technical performance characteristics while also allowing for ascertainment of some MC cases not detectable with HLA alone. The tandem use of both the InDel and the HLA provides a powerful tool for the enhanced ascertainment of MC.",

        "abstract": "Microchimerism (MC), defined as the persistence of allogeneic cells at low concentrations, is well documented in transfused trauma patients. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms linked to cytokine production could contribute to trauma-induced immune modulation and development of microchimerism after transfusion of trauma patients. We used high-throughput SYBR-green-based genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to characterize 59 transfused trauma patients, with MC (n=30) and without MC (n=29), for 4 functionally significant SNPs: TNF (-308), IL 10 (-1082), IFNG (+874), and TGFB1 (+915). We then compared likelihood for development of MC and the magnitude of immune suppression among subjects with and without these selected immune response SNPs. We identified a significant association between TNF (-308A) SNP and both development of MC and diminished immune responsiveness. Hence predisposing genetic factors may explain, in part, why only a subset of trauma patients develops transfusion-associated microchimerism.",

It is predicted that malaria parasites will spread to both higher altitudes and latitudes with global warming. Here we show for the first time that avian Plasmodium transmission occurs in the North American Arctic. Over a latitudinal gradient in Alaska, from 61°N to 67°N, we collected blood samples of resident and migratory bird species. We found both residents and hatch year birds infected with Plasmodium as far north as 64°N, providing clear evidence that malaria transmission occurs in these climates. Based on our empirical data, we make the first projections of the habitat suitability for Plasmodium under a future-warming scenario in Alaska. These findings raise new concerns about the spread of malaria to naïve host populations.",

Two tick strains (P67 and B74) were identified as susceptible to cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and flumethrin by DD, one strain (P65) was susceptible to cypermethrin and resistant to deltamethrin and flumethrin, and six strains were resistant to cypermethrin, delta-methrin, and flumethrin (T11, M10, C54, R49, B71, and T66). By using polymerase chain reaction, only 6.0 and 6.2% of resistance allele (R) was found in the susceptible strains (P67 and B74, respectively). In the T66 strain, with 100% of larval survival to the DD of pyrethroids as measured by the larval packet test (LPT), 98.0% of the gene pool contained the R allele. Positive correlations between the larval survival and the percentage of the R allele were found (deltamethrin r2 = 0.8875, P < 0.01; cypermethrin r2 = 0.8563, P < 0.01; and flumethrin r2 = 0.8491, P < 0.01). There were no significant correlations between the level of larval survival and esterase-based hydrolytic activity. It was concluded that within the B. microplus populations studied, resistance to flumethrin, deltamethrin, or cypermethrin was because of the novel sodium channel mutation (Phe-->Ile amino acid substitution in the S6 transmembrane segment of domain III), and there was a correlation between tick mortality by pyrethroid exposure (larval survival) and the presence of R allele. It was not determined whether enhanced esterase-based hydrolytic activity was involved in pyrethroid resistance in the populations tested.",

It has been reported for the first time in the Gulf of Guinea in 2000, first in Cameroon, then in Bioko Island in 2003 and more recently in Gabon in 2007. Here we report the first record of Ae. albopictus on São Tomé Island. Although we cannot estimate precisely the year of introduction on São Tomé Island, it most likely arrived within the last 10 years.

Effective control with methoprene had been achieved for over 20 years prior to this discovery. Susceptibility tests indicated that the Fresno Oc nigromaculis populations had developed several thousand-fold higher LC50 and LC90 tolerance levels to methoprene compared with methoprene-naïve populations. The synergists piperonyl butoxide (PBO), S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate and 3-octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanone had little synergistic effect, suggesting that the mechanism of methoprene tolerance was not mediated by P450 monooxygenase or carboxylesterase enzyme degradation. As part of initiating a resistance management strategy, partial reversion back to methoprene susceptibility was achieved in a resistant population after six consecutive applications of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis Goldberg & Marga coupled with two oil and two pyrethrum + PBO applications.",

Dynamic forces which are neglected by the quasi-static analysis, will have ~n effect on efficiency. Thus, an exact theory based on the simultaneous solution of both the Newton-Euler equations of motion and the relevant kinematic equations is employed to determine mechanism efficiency, as well as the steady-state motion of all component within the ball screw. However, the development of design methods based on this exact theory is difficult due to the extensive computation necessary and thus, an approximate closed-form representation, that still accounts for the ball screw dynamics, is derived. The validity of this closed-form solution is proven and it is then used in developing an optimum design methodology for the ball screw mechanism based on efficiency. Additionally, the selfbraking condition is examined, as are load capacity considerations.",

Many transportation departments and agencies are already using some aspects of CIM. Several efforts have been undertaken to provide guidelines to implement CIM-related technologies; however, few have developed measurable quantitative methodologies based on the unique strengths of a specific agency or Department of Transportation (DOT). This study presents a method to assess what areas of CIM may be easier for a DOT to implement based on its own unique attributes. The method involves using an online survey in combination with a statistical test. Applying the method, a DOT or other transportation agencies will be able to make a more methodological decision on deployment of certain tools of CIM. Unlike previously presented methods, the methodology presented here is designed to be repeatable and applicable to any transportation agency interested in deploying CIM. Example real-world data and recommendations are provided to illustrate the method.",

The inherent flexibility in choosing generalized velocity components as a function of generalized coordinates is used to influence the structure of the resulting dynamical equations. Initially, we describe how a congruency transformation can be formed that represents the transformation between generalized velocity components and generalized coordinate derivatives. It is shown that the proper choice for the congruency transformation will insure generation of first-order decoupled equations of motion for holonomic systems. In the case of nonholonomic systems, or more complex dynamics systems, where the appropriate congruency transformation may be difficult to obtain, we present a constraint relaxations method based on the use of orthogonal complements. The results are illustrated using several examples. Finally, we discuss numerical implementation of congruency transformation to achieve first-order decoupled equations for simulation purposes.",

We show how De Casteljau's algorithm for constructing Bezier curves can be extended in a natural way to Riemannian manifolds. We then consider a special class of Riemannian manifold, the Lie groups. Because of their algebraic group structure Lie groups admit an elegant, efficient recursive algorithm for constructing Bezier curves. Spatial displacements of a rigid body also form a Lie group, and can therefore be interpolated (in the Bezier sense) using this recursive algorithm. We apply this algorithm to the kinematic problem of trajectory generation or motion interpolation for a moving rigid body.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of topical rho-kinase inhibitor ripasudil in the treatment of primary corneal endothelial degeneration (PCED) in dogs. METHODS: Twenty-one eyes of 12 client-owned, PCED-affected dogs received topical ripasudil 4 times daily. Ophthalmic examination, ultrasonic pachymetry (USP), Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT), and in vivo confocal microscopy were performed at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Effects of treatment on corneal thickness, corneal edema extent, and endothelial cell density (ECD) were evaluated by repeated-measures ANOVA or Friedman test. Individual eyes were classified as improved, progressed, or stable at 12 months using clinical response criteria. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were used to compare ripasudil-treated eyes to age-, breed/size-, and disease stage-matched historical controls. RESULTS: During treatment, 12 dogs developed conjunctival hyperemia, 4 demonstrated reticular bullous epithelial edema, and 2 developed corneal stromal hemorrhage. No adverse event necessitated permanent cessation of ripasudil. Central corneal thickness measured by USP significantly progressed from baseline to 12 months. Corneal thickness by FD-OCT, ECD, and edema extent did not differ over time. Considered individually, 5 eyes improved, 8 remained stable, and 8 progressed. The log-rank test found less edema progression in ripasudil-treated eyes compared to historical controls. CONCLUSIONS: Ripasudil was well-tolerated in PCED-affected dogs. Response to therapy varied; 62% of eyes showed improved or stable disease whereas 38% progressed. Ripasudil-treated eyes progressed more slowly than historical controls. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Topical ripasudil offered a therapeutic benefit in a subset of patients using a canine model of endothelial degeneration, which may guide future trials in humans.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To define the normal range of central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and the effects of age, body weight, sex, and intraocular pressure (IOP) on these parameters. METHODS: Ophthalmic examinations were performed on 144 rhesus macaques without anterior segment pathology. The CCT was measured via ultrasound pachymetry (USP) and specular microscopy, and the ECD was semiautomatically and manually counted using specular microscopy. Rebound tonometry was used to measure IOP. Linear regression and mixed-effects linear regression models were used to evaluate the effects of age, body weight, sex, and IOP on CCT and ECD. RESULTS: We included 98 females and 46 males with an age range of 0.2 to 29.4 years. The mean CCT by USP and specular microscopy were 483 ± 39 and 463 ± 33 µm, respectively, and were statistically different (P < 0.001). The ECDs were 2717 ± 423 and 2747 ± 438 cells/mm2 by semiautomated and manual analysis, respectively. Corneal endothelial degeneration was identified in one aged rhesus macaque. CONCLUSIONS: The mean USP and specular microscopy CCT values differed significantly, whereas the semiautomatic and manual ECD did not. The CCT was associated with the IOP and sex, whereas the ECD was associated with body weight and age (P < 0.05). As in humans, corneal disease in rhesus macaques is uncommon. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Establishing reference values is fundamental to use rhesus macaques as a model for corneal disease or to identify toxicity in studies of ocular drugs or devices.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic associations with primary glaucoma (PG) in American Cocker Spaniels using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). ANIMALS: A nationwide ambidirectional case-control cohort study was performed in American Cocker Spaniels that had an ophthalmic examination performed by a veterinarian. Ninety-four dogs with PG (cases) and 111 dogs without glaucoma (controls) met phenotypic criteria and had a blood sample collected after receiving informed owner consent. PROCEDURES: Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and genotyped (CanineHD BeadChip, Illumina Inc). A case-control GWAS using a linear mixed model was performed, and 3 significance thresholds were calculated (1) using a Bonferroni correction on all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) included in the GWAS, (2) using a Bonferroni correction on only the unlinked SNPs from a pruned data set, and (3) using 10,000 random phenotype permutations. RESULTS: Following genotype data quality control, 89 cases and 93 controls were included in the GWAS. We identified an association on canine chromosome (CFA10); however, it did not reach statistical significance. Potential candidate genes within the surrounding linkage disequilibrium interval include coiled-coil domain containing 85A (CCDC85A) and extracellular growth factor containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Primary glaucoma in the American Cocker Spaniel is a complex heterogeneous disease that may be influenced by a locus on CFA10. The candidate genes CCDC85A and EFEMP1 within the identified linkage disequilibrium interval have been shown to be involved in human open-angle glaucoma.",

Fibrosis occurs from many causes including trauma, photorefractive surgery, microbial keratitis (infection of the cornea), and chemical burns, yet there is a paucity of therapeutics to prevent or treat corneal fibrosis. This study aimed to determine if andrographolide, a labdane diterpenoid found in Andrographis paniculate, has anti-fibrotic properties. Furthermore, we evaluated if andrographolide could prevent the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts in vitro, given that the transforming growth factor beta-1(TGF-β1) stimulated persistence of myofibroblasts in the cornea is a primary component of fibrosis. We demonstrated that andrographolide inhibited the upregulation of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) mRNA and protein in rabbit corneal fibroblasts (RCFs), thus, demonstrating a reduction in the transdifferentiation of myofibroblasts. Immunofluorescent staining of TGF-β1-stimulated RCFs confirmed a dose-dependent decrease in αSMA expression when treated with andrographolide. Additionally, andrographolide was well tolerated in vivo and had no impact on corneal epithelialization in a rat debridement model. These data support future studies investigating the use of andrographolide as an anti-fibrotic in corneal wound healing.",

The PACG in most of canine breeds is epidemiologically similar to humans with older and female patients overrepresented with the condition. The American Cocker Spaniel (ACS) is among the most common breeds observed with PACG development in dogs. This study initially sought to identify genetic risk factors to explain the high prevalence of PACG in ACSs by using a case-control breed-matched genome-wide association study. However, the GWAS failed to identify candidate loci associated with PACG in this breed. This study then assessed intrinsic ocular morphologic traits that may relate to PACG susceptibility in this breed. Normal ACSs without glaucoma have a crowded anterior ocular segment and narrow iridocorneal angle and ciliary cleft, which is consistent with anatomical risk factors identified in humans. The ACSs showed unique features consisting of posterior bowing of iris and longer iridolenticular contact, which mirrors reverse pupillary block and pigment dispersion syndrome in humans. The ACS could hold potential to serve as an animal model of naturally occurring PACG in humans.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of maternal autoantibody-related autism spectrum disorder (MAR-ASD) in 2 geographically distinct DBPNet clinical sites (Pennsylvania and Arkansas). MAR-ASD is a biologically defined subtype of ASD that is defined by the presence of autoantibodies specific to proteins in the fetal brain and present in approximately 20% of a Northern California sample but has not been studied in other states. METHODS: Sixty-eight mothers of children with ASD were recruited from 2 DBPNet clinics and provided blood samples. Mothers also completed behavioral questionnaires about their children, and data from the child's clinical diagnostic assessment were abstracted. RESULTS: The mean age of mothers was 38.5 ± 6.1 years, and the mean age of children was 8.3 ± 2.7 years. MAR-ASD was present in 24% of the sample and similar across sites. Children of +MAR mothers had more severe autism symptoms as measured by Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule comparison scores (W = 3604; p < 0.001) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (W = 4556; p < 0.001). There were no differences in IQ, adaptive function, or aberrant behavior. CONCLUSION: MAR-ASD is a subtype of autism that is present in similar frequencies across 3 states and related to autism severity.",

        "abstract": "Malaria-induced bacteremia has been shown to result from intestinal mast cell (MC) activation. The appearance of MCs in the ileum and increased intestinal permeability to enteric bacteria are preceded by an early Th2-biased host immune response to infection, characterized by the appearance of IL-4, IL-10, mast cell protease (Mcpt)1 and Mcpt4, and increased circulating basophils and eosinophils. Given the functional similarities of basophils and MCs in the context of allergic inflammation and the capacity of basophils to produce large amounts of IL-4, we sought to define the role of basophils in increased intestinal permeability, in MC influx, and in the development of bacteremia in the context of malaria. Upon infection with nonlethal Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 17XNL, Basoph8 × ROSA-DTα mice or baso (-) mice that lack basophils exhibited increased intestinal permeability and increased ileal MC numbers, without any increase in bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA copy numbers in the blood, relative to baso (+) mice. Analysis of cytokines, chemokines, and MC-associated factors in the ileum revealed significantly increased TNF-α and IL-13 at day 6 postinfection in baso (-) mice compared with baso (+) mice. Moreover, network analysis of significantly correlated host immune factors revealed profound differences between baso (-) and baso (+) mice following infection in both systemic and ileal responses to parasites and translocated bacteria. Finally, basophil depletion was associated with significantly increased gametocytemia and parasite transmission to Anopheles mosquitoes, suggesting that basophils play a previously undescribed role in controlling gametocytemia and, in turn, mammalian host-to-mosquito parasite transmission.",

However, the mechanisms by which maternal adiposity influences fetal developmental programming remain to be elucidated. We aimed to understand the impact of maternal obesity on the metabolism of both pregnant mothers and their offspring, as well as on metabolic, brain, and behavioral development of offspring by utilizing metabolomics, protein, and behavioral assays in a non-human primate model. We found that maternal obesity was associated with elevated inflammation and significant alterations in metabolites of energy metabolism and one-carbon metabolism in maternal plasma and urine, as well as in the placenta. Infants that were born to obese mothers were significantly larger at birth compared to those that were born to lean mothers. Additionally, they exhibited significantly reduced novelty preference and significant alterations in their emotional response to stress situations. These changes coincided with differences in the phosphorylation of enzymes in the brain mTOR signaling pathway between infants that were born to obese and lean mothers and correlated with the concentration of maternal plasma betaine during pregnancy. In summary, gestational obesity significantly impacted the infant systemic and brain metabolome and adaptive behaviors.",

Given that IL-18 is an early cytokine/alarmin in malaria and has been shown to activate basophils, we sought to determine the role of the basophil IL-18R in this protective phenotype. To address this, we infected control [IL18r flox/flox or basoIL-18R (+)] mice and mice with basophils lacking the IL-18R [IL18r flox/flox × Basoph8 or basoIL-18R (-)] with Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 17XNL, a nonlethal strain of mouse malaria. Postinfection (PI), intestinal permeability, ileal mastocytosis, bacteremia, and levels of ileal and plasma cytokines and chemokines were measured through 10 d PI. BasoIL-18R (-) mice exhibited greater intestinal permeability relative to basoIL-18R (+) mice, along with increased plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines at a single time point PI, day 4 PI, a pattern not observed in basoIL-18R (+) mice. Surprisingly, mosquitoes fed on basoIL-18R (-) mice became infected less frequently than mosquitoes fed on basoIL-18R (+) mice, with no difference in gametocytemia, a pattern that was distinct from that observed previously with basophil-depleted mice. These findings suggest that early basophil-dependent protection of the intestinal barrier in malaria is mediated by IL-18, and that basophil IL-18R-dependent signaling differentially regulates the inflammatory response to infection and parasite transmission.",

        "abstract": "Globally, malaria continues to be an enormous public health burden, with concomitant parasite-induced damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) barrier resulting in bacteremia-associated morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. Infected red blood cells sequester in and can occlude the GI microvasculature, ultimately leading to disruption of the tight and adherens junctions that would normally serve as a physical barrier to translocating enteric bacteria. Mast cell (MC) activation and translocation to the GI during malaria intensifies damage to the physical barrier and weakens the immunological barrier through the release of enzymes and factors that alter the host response to escaped enteric bacteria. In this context, activated MCs release Th2 cytokines, promoting a balanced Th1/Th2 response that increases local and systemic allergic inflammation while protecting the host from overwhelming Th1-mediated immunopathology. Beyond the mammalian host, recent studies in both the lab and field have revealed an association between a Th2-skewed host response and success of parasite transmission to mosquitoes, biology that is evocative of parasite manipulation of the mammalian host. Collectively, these observations suggest that malaria-induced bacteremia may be, in part, an unintended consequence of a Th2-shifted host response that promotes parasite survival and transmission. Future directions of this work include defining the factors and mechanisms that precede the development of bacteremia, which will enable the development of biomarkers to simplify diagnostics, the identification of therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes and better understanding of the consequences of clinical interventions to transmission blocking strategies.",

A community pandemic-response program was launched in a college town that deployed epidemiological infection-control measures and health behavior change interventions.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Database linkage between cancer registries and clinical trial consortia has the potential to elucidate referral patterns of children and adolescents with newly diagnosed cancer, including enrollment into cancer clinical trials. This study's primary objective was to assess the feasibility of this linkage approach. METHODS: Patients younger than 20 years diagnosed with incident cancer during 2012-2017 in the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) were linked with patients enrolled in a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study. Matched patients between databases were described by sex, age, race and ethnicity, geographical location when diagnosed, and cancer type. Logistic regression modeling identified factors associated with COG study enrollment. Timeliness of patient identification by KCR was reported through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Early Case Capture (ECC) program. RESULTS: Of 1,357 patients reported to KCR, 47% were determined by matching to be enrolled in a COG study. Patients had greater odds of enrollment if they were age 0-4 years (v 15-19 years), reported from a COG-affiliated institution, and had renal cancer, neuroblastoma, or leukemia. Patients had lower odds of enrollment if Hispanic (v non-Hispanic White) or had epithelial (eg, thyroid, melanoma) cancer. Most (59%) patients were reported to KCR within 10 days of pathologic diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Linkage of clinical trial data with cancer registries is a feasible approach for tracking patient referral and clinical trial enrollment patterns. Adolescents had lower enrollment compared with younger age groups, independent of cancer type. Population-based early case capture could guide interventions designed to increase cancer clinical trial enrollment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Healthy Davis Together was a program launched in September 2020 in the city of Davis, California, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate the return to normalcy. The program involved multiple interventions, including free saliva-based asymptomatic testing, targeted communication campaigns, education efforts, and distribution of personal protective equipment, community partnerships, and investments in the local economy. OBJECTIVE: This study identified demographic characteristics of individuals that underwent testing and assessed adherence to testing over time in a community pandemic-response program launched in a college town in California, United States. METHODS: This study outlines overall testing engagement, identifies demographic characteristics of participants, and evaluates testing participation changes over 4 periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, distinguished by the dominant variants Delta and Omicron. Additionally, a recurrent model is employed to explore testing patterns based on the participants' frequency, timing, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 770,165 tests were performed between November 18, 2020, and June 30, 2022, among 89,924 (41.1% of total population) residents of Yolo County, with significant participation from racially or ethnically diverse participants and across age groups. Most positive cases (6351 of total) and highest daily participation (895 per 100,000 population) were during the Omicron period. There were some gender and age-related differences in the pattern of recurrent COVID-19 testing. Men were slightly less likely (hazard ratio [HR] 0.969, 95% CI 0.943-0.996) to be retested and more likely (HR 1.104, 95% CI 1.075-1.134) to stop testing altogether than women. People aged between 20 and 34 years were less likely to be retested (HR 0.861, 95% CI 0.828-0.895) and more likely to stop testing altogether (HR 2.617, 95% CI 2.538-2.699). However, older age groups were less likely to stop testing, especially those aged between 65-74 years and 75-84 years, than those aged between 0 and 19 years. The likelihood of stopping testing was lower (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.889-0.976) for the Asian group and higher for the Hispanic or Latino (HR 1.185, 95% CI 1.148-1.223) and Black or African American (HR 1.198, 95% CI 1.054-1.350) groups than the White group. CONCLUSIONS: The unique features of a pandemic response program that supported community-wide access to free asymptomatic testing provide a unique opportunity to evaluate adherence to testing recommendations and testing trends over time. Identification of individual and group-level factors associated with testing behaviors can provide insights for identifying potential areas of improvement in future testing initiatives.",

Human beta coronaviridae, known for causing respiratory tract diseases, often bind Sias, and some preferentially bind to those with 9-O-Ac-modification. Currently, co-binding of SARS-CoV-2, a beta coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, to human Sias has been reported and its preference towards α2-3-linked Neu5Ac has been shown. Nevertheless, O-acetylated Sias-protein binding studies are difficult to perform, due to the ester lability. We studied the binding free energy differences between Neu5,9Ac2α2-3GalβpNP and its more stable 9-NAc mimic binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using molecular dynamics and alchemical free energy simulations. We identified multiple Sia-binding pockets, including two novel sites, with similar binding affinities to those of MERS-CoV, a known co-binder of sialic acid. In our binding poses, 9-NAc and 9-OAc Sias bind similarly, suggesting an experimentally reasonable mimic to probe viral mechanisms.",

Some viruses bind preferentially to sialic acids with O-acetyl modification at the hydroxyl group of C7, C8, or C9 on the glycerol-like side chain. Studies of proteins binding to sialosides containing O-acetylated sialic acids are crucial in understanding the related diseases but experimentally difficult due to the lability of the ester group. We recently showed that O-acetyl migration among hydroxyl groups of C7, C8, and C9 in sialic acids occurs in all directions in a pH-dependent manner. In the current study, we elucidate a full mechanistic pathway for the migration of O-acetyl among C7, C8, and C9. We used an ab initio nanoreactor to explore potential reaction pathways and density functional theory, pKa calculations, and umbrella sampling to investigate elementary steps of interest. We found that when a base is present, migration is easy in any direction and involves three key steps: deprotonation of the hydroxyl group, cyclization between the two carbons, and the migration of the O-acetyl group. This dynamic equilibrium may play a defensive role against pathogens that evolve to gain entry to the cell by binding selectively to one acetylation state.",

        "abstract": "Glycans that are abundantly displayed on vertebrate cell surface and secreted molecules are often capped with terminal sialic acids (Sias). These diverse 9-carbon-backbone monosaccharides are involved in numerous intrinsic biological processes. They also interact with commensals and pathogens, while undergoing dynamic changes in time and space, often influenced by environmental conditions. However, most of this sialoglycan complexity and variation remains poorly characterized by conventional techniques, which often tend to destroy or overlook crucial aspects of Sia diversity and/or fail to elucidate native structures in biological systems, i.e. in the intact sialome. To date, in situ detection and analysis of sialoglycans has largely relied on the use of plant lectins, sialidases, or antibodies, whose preferences (with certain exceptions) are limited and/or uncertain. We took advantage of naturally evolved microbial molecules (bacterial adhesins, toxin subunits, and viral hemagglutinin-esterases) that recognize sialoglycans with defined specificity to delineate 9 classes of sialoglycan recognizing probes (SGRPs: SGRP1-SGRP9) that can be used to explore mammalian sialome changes in a simple and systematic manner, using techniques common in most laboratories. SGRP candidates with specificity defined by sialoglycan microarray studies were engineered as tagged probes, each with a corresponding nonbinding mutant probe as a simple and reliable negative control. The optimized panel of SGRPs can be used in methods commonly available in most bioscience labs, such as ELISA, western blot, flow cytometry, and histochemistry. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we provide examples of sialoglycome differences in tissues from C57BL/6 wild-type mice and human-like Cmah-/- mice.",

        "abstract": "Vertebrate sialic acids (Sias) display much diversity in modifications, linkages, and underlying glycans. Slide microarrays allow high-throughput explorations of sialoglycan-protein interactions. A microarray presenting ~150 structurally defined sialyltrisaccharides with various Sias linkages and modifications still poses challenges in planning, data sorting, visualization, and analysis. To address these issues, we devised a simple 9-digit code for sialyltrisaccharides with terminal Sias and underlying two monosaccharides assigned from the nonreducing end, with 3 digits assigning a monosaccharide, its modifications, and linkage. Calculations based on the encoding system reveal >113,000 likely linear sialyltrisaccharides in nature. Notably, a biantennary N-glycan with 2 terminal sialyltrisaccharides could thus have >1010 potential combinations and a triantennary N-glycan with 3 terminal sequences, >1015 potential combinations. While all possibilities likely do not exist in nature, sialoglycans encode enormous diversity. While glycomic approaches are used to probe such diverse sialomes, naturally occurring bacterial AB5 toxin B subunits are simpler tools to track the dynamic sialome in biological systems. Sialoglycan microarray was utilized to compare sialoglycan-recognizing bacterial toxin B subunits. Unlike the poor correlation between B subunits and species phylogeny, there is stronger correlation with Sia-epitope preferences. Further supporting this pattern, we report a B subunit (YenB) from Yersinia enterocolitica (broad host range) recognizing almost all sialoglycans in the microarray, including 4-O-acetylated-Sias not recognized by a Yersinia pestis orthologue (YpeB). Differential Sia-binding patterns were also observed with phylogenetically related B subunits from Escherichia coli (SubB), Salmonella Typhi (PltB), Salmonella Typhimurium (ArtB), extra-intestinal E.coli (EcPltB), Vibrio cholera (CtxB), and cholera family homologue of E. coli (EcxB).",

        "abstract": "Genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity jointly shape intraspecific trait variation, but their roles differ among traits. In short-lived plants, reproductive traits may be more genetically determined due to their impact on fitness, whereas vegetative traits may show higher plasticity to buffer short-term perturbations. Combining a multi-treatment greenhouse experiment with observational field data throughout the range of a widespread short-lived herb, Plantago lanceolata, we (1) disentangled genetic and plastic responses of functional traits to a set of environmental drivers and (2) assessed how genetic differentiation and plasticity shape observational trait-environment relationships. Reproductive traits showed distinct genetic differentiation that largely determined observational patterns, but only when correcting traits for differences in biomass. Vegetative traits showed higher plasticity and opposite genetic and plastic responses, masking the genetic component underlying field-observed trait variation. Our study suggests that genetic differentiation may be inferred from observational data only for the traits most closely related to fitness.",

        "issued": "2023-02",
        "abstract": "Across taxa, the timing of life-history events (phenology) is changing in response to warming temperatures. However, little is known about drivers of variation in phenological trends among species. We analysed 168 years of museum specimen and sighting data to evaluate the patterns of phenological change in 70 species of solitary bees that varied in three ecological traits: diet breadth (generalist or specialist), seasonality (spring, summer or fall) and nesting location (above-ground or below-ground). We estimated changes in onset, median, end and duration of each bee species' annual activity (flight duration) using quantile regression. To determine whether ecological traits could explain phenological trends, we compared average trends across species groups that differed in a single trait. We expected that specialist bees would be constrained by their host plants' phenology and would show weaker phenological change than generalist species. We expected phenological advances in spring and delays in summer and fall. Lastly, we expected stronger shifts in above-ground versus below-ground nesters. Across all species, solitary bees have advanced their phenology by 0.43 days/decade. Since 1970, this advancement has increased fourfold to 1.62 days/decade. Solitary bees have also lengthened their flight period by 0.44 days/decade. Seasonality and nesting location explained variation in trends among species. Spring- and summer-active bees tended to advance their phenology, whereas fall-active bees tended to delay. Above-ground nesting species experienced stronger advances than below-ground nesting bees in spring; however, the opposite was true in summer. Diet breadth was not associated with patterns of phenological change. Our study has two key implications. First, an increasing activity period of bees across the flight season means that bee communities will potentially provide pollination services for a longer period of time during the year. And, since phenological trends in solitary bees can be explained by some ecological traits, our study provides insight into mechanisms underpinning population viability of insect pollinators in a changing world.",

        "issued": "2022-09",
        "abstract": "Insect herbivores can be limited by host plants in two ways: density-dependent competition for food resources or density-independent search time limitation. Our understanding of density-dependent host plant limitation is relatively well developed and well integrated into conservation plans for at-risk insects. Search time limitation, a density-independent process, is much less well developed. Here, we explore both mechanisms using empirically based models of monarch butterfly population dynamics. These mechanisms differ fundamentally in their predictions: resource competition leads to matching of herbivore densities to host plant densities, and visible competition via consumption of host plants. Search time limitation leads to changes in population growth rate that can cause herbivore numbers to decline when host plant densities are constant. Search time limitation also implies that host plants can limit herbivores, even when many individual plants are uneaten. For monarch butterflies, our calculations suggest that many parts of North America have host plant densities below the threshold for search time limitation, which contrasts with the typical assumption of resource competition. More generally, incorporating search time limitation into conservation plans is important for reframing our understanding of how host plants limit insect herbivores in highly fragmented landscapes.",

        "abstract": "Cyclical fluctuations in reproductive output are widespread among perennial plants, from multi-year masting cycles in forest trees to alternate bearing in horticultural crops. In natural systems, ecological drivers such as climate and pollen limitation can result in synchrony among plants. Agricultural practices are generally assumed to outweigh ecological drivers that might synchronize alternate-bearing individuals, but this assumption has not been rigorously assessed and little is known about the role of pollen limitation as a driver of synchrony in alternate-bearing crops. We tested whether alternate-bearing perennial crops show signs of alternate bearing at a national scale and whether the magnitude of national-scale alternate bearing differs across pollination syndromes. We analysed the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations time series (1961-2018) of national crop yields across the top-producing countries of 27 alternate-bearing taxa, 6 wind-pollinated and 21 insect-pollinated. Alternate bearing was common in these national data and more pronounced in wind-pollinated taxa, which exhibited a more negative lag-1 autocorrelation and a higher coefficient of variation (CV). We highlight the mutual benefits of integrating ecological theory and agricultural data for (i) advancing our understanding of perennial plant reproduction across time, space and taxa, and (ii) promoting stable farmer livelihoods and global food supply. This article is part of the theme issue 'The ecology and evolution of synchronized seed production in plants'.",

        "abstract": "In the western United States, the population of migratory monarch butterflies is on the brink of collapse, having dropped from several million butterflies in the 1980s to ~2000 butterflies in the winter of 2020-2021. At the same time, a resident (non-migratory) monarch butterfly population in urban gardens has been growing in abundance. The new resident population is not sufficient to make up for the loss of the migratory population; there are still orders of magnitude fewer butterflies now than in the recent past. The resident population also probably lacks the demographic capacity to expand its range inland during summer months. Nonetheless, the resident population may have the capacity to persist. This sudden change emphasises the extent to which environmental change can have unexpected consequences, and how quickly these changes can happen. We hope it will provoke discussion about how we define resilience and viability in changing environments.",
