      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Dietary diversity scores and dichotomous indicators derived from them are widely used to assess dietary quality and specific scoring methods have been recommended for women and 6- to 23-mo-old children. However there is no specific score recommended for older children and the effect of seasonal dietary changes on score performance is not well documented. OBJECTIVE We assessed performance of 2 recommended dietary diversity scores as indicators of dietary quality over 3 seasons. METHODS We conducted 7 repeat 24-h dietary recalls among 4- to 8-y-old rural Zambian children n 200 over 6 mo. Dietary diversity was assessed using a 7-food group score for assessing infant and young child feeding DDS-IYCF and a 10-food group score for use among women of reproductive age DDS-W. Micronutrient intake adequacy was described by mean probability of adequacy MPA over 11 micronutrients. Longitudinal models were fit to test the association between each score and MPA overall and by season. Receiver operating characteristic ROC curves were used to describe indicator performance of each score. RESULTS Mean SE scores were 4.11 0.03 for DDS-IYCF and 4.39 0.03 for DDS-W. Both scores varied by season but DDS-W better reflected seasonal dietary changes. Across seasons MPA increased 1-6 percentage pointsunit increase in DDS-IYCF or 1-10 percentage points for DDS-W P 0.05. Score performance as a predictor of MPA 0.75 was moderate with area under the ROC curve values by season ranging from 0.63 to 0.77 for DDS-IYCF and from 0.66 to 0.72 for DDS-W. CONCLUSIONS DDS-W performed better than DDS-IYCF in characterizing seasonal variability and micronutrient adequacy among rural Zambian children.",

      "abstract": "17O-excess is a relatively new water isotope parameter that could potentially provide useful information about the hydrological cycle. Previous works focusing on 17O-excess in polar regions suggest that it primarily tracks moisture source relative humidity but little is known about how to interpret 17O-excess data in lower latitudes. Here we present quasi-hourly triple oxygen isotope data of precipitation collected from two tropical cyclones in Texas and Louisiana in 2020 to understand the impacts of environmental and meteorological processes on the 17O-excess of low-to mid-latitude precipitation. We find that at both hourly timescales and the event scale 17O-excess is strongly correlated to changes in on-site rainfall intensity and relative humidity which is consistent with the theory that the isotopic fractionation associated with rain re-evaporation lowers the 17O-excess of the remaining droplet. In addition although evaporative conditions at the moisture source region may also influence 17O-excess of water vapor transported to the precipitation site their impacts are likely overprinted by the post-condensation rain re-evaporation processes. Our results thus suggest that 17O-excess can be used as a proxy for local rather than source region evaporative conditions during tropical cyclones.",

Effective January 1 2017 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA implemented regulatory changes requiring veterinary oversight for therapeutic uses of medically-important antimicrobial drugs MIADs administered in feed VFD and water veterinary prescription. Similarly effective January 1 2018 the CA legislature enacted California Food and Agricultural Code FAC 14400-14408 formerly known as Senate Bill 27 SB 27 requiring veterinary prescriptions for all other dosage forms of MIADs. METHODS The questionnaire consisted of 43 questions partitioned into three sections to assess herd information management practices and AMD use and perspectives. The questionnaire was mailed to 1282 grade A licensed dairies in CA and 149 responses 11.6 were collected from 19 counties across the three defined regions of CA Northern CA NCA Northern San Joaquin Valley NSJV and Greater Southern CA GSCA. RESULTS Most dairies reported treating all dry cows with intramammary AMD andor teat sealant at the end of a lactation 87.2. In 92.3 of dairies producers relied on the veterinarian for information about AMD used to treat cows. Treatment duration for cows treated with AMD was based on the drug manufacturers label and veterinarians instructions in most dairies 98.6. Most respondents to the survey confirmed having a valid veterinarian-client-patient-relationship VCPR for their dairies 91.7 participated in animal welfare audit programs 81.8 and dairy quality assurance programs 52.9. Approximately 98.6 respondents were aware that all uses of MIADs in livestock required a veterinary feed directive VFD or prescription and are no longer sold over-the-counter OTC in CA since January 1 2018. Multiple factor analysis MFA was performed and identified seven components composed of 21 variables questions that explained 99.7 of the total variance in the data. Hierarchical cluster analysis on the principal coordinates of the MFA based on conventional dairy survey responses identified two clusters characterized as large conventional dairies median herd size 1265 cows and mid-sized conventional dairies median herd size 715 cows mostly in GSCA and NSJV. The organic dairies grouped into a single cluster of median herd size of 325 cows mostly in NCA. CONCLUSIONS The survey results contribute to the knowledge of AMD use and antimicrobial stewardship practices on CA dairies since the implementation of the SB 27 and VFD laws and provide useful information for future evaluation of resistance-related risk in adult cows.",

Shrink as WW oDM and vcoDM were 9017 6818 and 2821 gkg suggesting that much WW shrink is water and much oDM shrink is volatiles lost during analytical oven drying. Most shrink occurred in the silage mass with losses from exposed silage faces as well as between exposed face silage removal and the total mixed ration mixer being low. Silage bulk density exposed silage face management and face use rate did not have obvious impacts on any shrink measure but age of the silage pile during silage feedout impacted shrink losses older silage piles being higher but most strongly for WW shrink. Real shrink losses i.e. vcoDM of large well managed corn silage piles are low the exposed silage face is a small portion of losses and many proposed shrink mitigations appeared ineffective possibly because shrink was low overall and they are largely directed at the exposed silage face.",

METHODS Parents of sons with XLRS who were evaluated at the National Eye Institute between December 2017 and January 2019 were eligible for this study. Participation involved engaging in a semistructured interview and completing a survey assessing optimism anxiety personality traits and sociodemographics using valid and reliable scales. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically and scales were scored and used descriptively. RESULTS Eleven mothers and 8 fathers from 13 families participated. Optimism anxiety and personality traits fell into the normative ranges for the scales. Parents described a process of continuous adaptation to their sons condition. The initial diagnosis was characterized by shock grief and devastation for most parents. Maternal guilt was common but usually lessened over time. As parents adjusted to life postdiagnosis they attempted to achieve a state of normalcy while balancing a desire to protect their sons. Significant sources of stress included decisions around sports participation and driving. Among all parents the fear of retinal detachment was an ongoing concern. Most parents did identify perceived benefits from their experiences such as feelings of gratitude or family cohesion. CONCLUSIONS Most parents viewed XLRS as a significant challenge in their sons lives but one that could be overcome. Clinical encounters may be enhanced for families with XLRS by providing accurate information preparing families for potential challenges anticipating stressful decisions and meeting other families with XLRS.",

This study seeks to understand how family physicians themselves perceive the relationship between their specialtys values and abortion provision. METHODS We conducted in-depth interviews in 2019 with 56 family physicians who do not oppose abortion in the United States. We employed a deductive-inductive content analysis approach with memos to identify key themes. This analysis focuses on participants beliefs in the core values of family medicine and how those values relate to abortion in family medicine. RESULTS Participants identified and described six values of the specialty they prioritized which included relationships care across the lifespan whole-person care nonjudgmental care meeting community needs and social justice. Family physicians in the study overwhelmingly believed that abortion aligned with family medicine values regardless of whether they themselves provided abortion care. CONCLUSIONS Providing abortion care in primary care settings gives family physicians an opportunity to provide comprehensive care while improving access to meet community needs. As abortion care becomes increasingly restricted in the United States family physicians can manifest the values of family medicine through integrating abortion care into their practices in states where abortion remains legal.",

Azimuthal variations at fixed radius are typically 0.14 dex at z 1 reducing to 0.05 dex at z 0. Thus over time radial gradients become steeper while azimuthal variations become weaker more homogeneous. As a result azimuthal variations were larger than radial variations at z 0.8 tlookback 6.9 Gyr. Furthermore elemental abundances are measurably homogeneous to 0.05 dex across a radial range of R 3.5 kpc at z 1 and R 1.7 kpc at z 0.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Patients with cutaneous melanoma metastases have experienced excellent responses to intralesional interleukin IL-2. This has led to its recent inclusion into the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for management of cutaneous melanoma metastases. Despite this intralesional IL-2 has not been highlighted in the US literature nor have US physicians adopted it. OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of intralesional IL-2 combined with topical imiquimod and retinoid for treatment of cutaneous metastatic melanoma. METHODS A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cutaneous metastatic melanoma were treated with intralesional IL-2 combined with topical imiquimod and retinoid. RESULTS A 100 complete local response rate with long-term follow-up average of 24 months was seen in all 11 patients treated with this proposed regimen. Biopsy specimens of treated sites confirmed absence of malignant cells. The most common treatment-related adverse event was rigors. LIMITATIONS Small number of patients retrospective review of charts and lack of a comparison group were limitations. CONCLUSION Intralesional IL-2 administered concomitantly with topical imiquimod and a retinoid cream is a promising therapeutic option for managing cutaneous melanoma metastases. The regimen was well tolerated and should be considered as a reasonable alternative to surgical excision.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Cleaning staff in hospitals can spend an average of 10-20 min per day per patient room. Published literature shows a pattern of interactions between housekeepers and patients and that they believe themselves to be a part of the patient care team. To date no study about this phenomenon has been done in the United States or has framed them through the lens of patient care. OBJECTIVE To describe the experiences and perceptions of hospital housekeeping staff in relation to patient care. DESIGN Qualitative descriptive. SETTING A 625-bed tertiary academic medical center in the United States. PARTICIPANTS Eight housekeeping staff participated ranging from 40 to 62 years old from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds and worked at the study hospital from 4 months to 20 years. Interviews were conducted between September 2020-October 2020. Participants were recruited through flyers email and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews lasting 30 - 60 min. Data were analysed through thematic analysis using a 6-step framework that included data familiarization generation of initial codes search for themes review of data definition and naming of themes and generation of a written report. Trustworthiness of the data was established through strategies such as reflective journaling researcher triangulation and member-checking. RESULTS Three themes emerged 1 Here to take care of you 2 Difficulties Coping and 3 Perceptions of their role. These three themes provide insight into participants perceptions of patient interactions and the kind of connections they formed with patients as they went about their duties. CONCLUSIONS Study findings suggest that there exists among housekeeping staff a respect for the humanity of patients a duty to protect people from disease and a longstanding practice of engaging in therapeutic connections with patients. As noted elsewhere there remains a disparity between the importance of this role and the recognition and dignity afforded it. These results reveal an opportunity to expand our understanding of who we call a caregiver and to improve how we recognize and support each member of the healthcare team.",

      "abstract": "In the past few decades farmers and researchers have firmly established that biologically diversified farming systems improve ecosystem services both on and off the farm producing economic benefits for farmers and ecological benefits for surrounding landscapes. However adoption of these practices has been slow requiring a more nuanced examination of both barriers and opportunities to improve adoption rates. While previous research has demonstrated that both individual and structural factors shape farmers decisions about whether to adopt diversification practices this study aims to understand the interaction of these individual and structural factors and how they relate to farm scale. Based on 20 interviews with organic lettuce growers on the Central Coast of California as well as 8 interviews with technical assistance providers who work with these growers we constructed a typology to help elucidate the distinct contexts that shape growers decisions about diversification practices. This typology which reflects the structural influence of land rent and supply chains divides growers into three categories limited resource mid-scale diversified or wholesale. In this economic context limited resource and wholesale growers both experience significant barriers that constrain the adoption of diversification practices while some mid-scale diversified growers have found a sweet spot for managing agroecosystems that can succeed in both economic and ecological terms. The key enabling factors that allow these farmers to choose diversification however are not directly related to their farm size but have more to do with secure land tenure adequate access to capital and resources and buyers who share their values and are willing to pay a premium. By focusing on these key enabling factors with targeted policies we believe it is possible to encourage diversification practices on farms at a variety of scales within Californias Central Coast.",

The major mortality factors of predation and unsuccessful hibernation acted evenly on all age classes as shown by the constant rates of survivorship. The rate of senescence indicated that the probability of mortality did not increase with age. Females produced litters from ages 2 to 10 years. Mean litter size was 4.1 and did not differ among age classes. The female generation length of 4.49 years was 2.4 times the life expectancy and the median survivorship. The net reproductive rate Ro was 0.67 yet the population did not continually decline adjustments to these data increased Ro to 0.85. Reproductive values Vx were approximately equal across the reproductive age classes. The polygynous mating system is both cause and effect of the demography.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of GIOP prevention and treatment options. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. We used a group consensus process to determine the final recommendations and grade their strength. The guideline addresses initial assessment and reassessment in patients beginning or continuing long-term 3 months glucocorticoid GC treatment as well as the relative benefits and harms of lifestyle modification and of calcium vitamin D bisphosphonate raloxifene teriparatide and denosumab treatment in the general adult population receiving long-term GC treatment as well as in special populations of long-term GC users. RESULTS Because of limited evidence regarding the benefits and harms of interventions in GC users most recommendations in this guideline are conditional uncertain balance between benefits and harms. Recommendations include treating only with calcium and vitamin D in adults at low fracture risk treating with calcium and vitamin D plus an additional osteoporosis medication oral bisphosphonate preferred in adults at moderate-to-high fracture risk continuing calcium plus vitamin D but switching from an oral bisphosphonate to another antifracture medication in adults in whom oral bisphosphonate treatment is not appropriate and continuing oral bisphosphonate treatment or switching to another antifracture medication in adults who complete a planned oral bisphosphonate regimen but continue to receive GC treatment. Recommendations for special populations including children people with organ transplants women of childbearing potential and people receiving very high-dose GC treatment are also made. CONCLUSION This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions. Clinicians and patients should use a shared decision-making process that accounts for patients values preferences and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.",

Four broad themes were explored Parental concerns regarding dating family communication about sexual issues family rules about dating and actual dating and sexual experiences. Consistent with traditional cultural views female romantic involvement outside of marriage was described as potentially dishonourable to the family. Because US-style dating was seen as a violation of traditional courtship styles most of the respondents families placed strict boundaries on adolescent sociosexual interaction. As a result many respondents described adolescent experiences of dating characterized by tension and conflict and reported vulnerability in eventual sexual encounters. In order to better understand the sexual behaviour of young Latina women in the USA researchers must examine sexual socialization within the family of origin and take parents culturally-influenced beliefs and practises into account. 2001 Taylor and Francis Group LLC.",

OBJECTIVE To characterize referrals to community-based organizations by primary care practices. DESIGN Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with healthcare administrators responsible for social care efforts in their organization. PARTICIPANTS Administrators at 50 diverse US healthcare organizations with efforts to address patients social risks. MAIN MEASURES Approaches used in primary care to implement social needs referral to community-based organizations. RESULTS Interviewed administrators reported that social needs referrals were an essential element in their social care activities. Administrators described the ideal referral programs as placing limited burden on care teams providing patients with customized referrals and facilitating closed-loop referrals. We identified three key challenges organizations experience when trying to implement the ideal referrals program 1 developing and maintaining resources lists 2 aligning referrals with patient needs and 3 measuring the efficacy of referrals. Collectively these challenges led to organizations relying on staff to manually develop and update resource lists and in most cases provide patients with generic referrals. Administrators not only hoped that referral platforms may help overcome some of these barriers but also reported implementation challenges with platforms including inconsistent buy-in and use across staff integration with electronic health records management and prioritization of resources and alignment with other organizations in their market. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Referrals to community-based organizations were used in primary care to improve patients social conditions but despite strong motivations interviewees reported challenges providing tailored and up-to-date information to patients.",

This is especially crucial for Californias almond orchards which are the most N-hungry nut crop and require substantial N for high productivity. The current practices of uniform and extensive N application lead to N leaching into the groundwater creating environmental hazards. Traditional remote sensing methods often rely on data-driven approaches that work well statistically achieving a high Rjatssup2jatssup value with one dataset but arent adaptable across different datasets. To create a more robust data-driven model one would typically need a vast and varied collection of datasets. Our goal however is to develop a more universally applicable model using smaller datasets typical of commercial orchards that can accurately estimate N content in tree canopies regardless of differences in spatial spectral and temporal data. In this study we investigate and evaluate multiple remote sensing approaches for estimating N concentration in Californian almonds utilizing hyperspectral imaging at the canopy level. We assess various classical vegetation indices machine learning models and a physics-informed 3D radiative transfer model. While cross-validated results show comparable results for radiative transfer models and best-performing machine learning models most single vegetation indices are not capable of exceeding the baseline model jatsinline-formula jatstex-mathfleftmathbfxrightbaryjatstex-math jatsinline-formula and thus had Rjatssup2jatssup value less than 0. Despite being less commonly used 3D radiative transfer modeling shows promise as a strong and adaptable method producing results that are comparable to the best machine learning models.jatsp",

Physiologically a great degree of similarity is seen between humans and farm pigs FPs but the pigs rapid growth confers a significant challenge for in vivo experiments. Minipigs have a slower growth rate and are smaller than FPs but minipig TMJ discs have yet to be fully characterized. The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of the minipig for TMJ studies by extensive structural and functional characterization. The properties of minipig TMJ discs closely reproduced previously reported morphological biochemical and biomechanical values of human and FP discs. The widthlength dimension ratio of the minipig TMJ disc was 1.95 1.69 for human and 1.94 for FP. The biochemical evaluation revealed on average per wet weight 24.3 collagen 22.8 for human and 24.9 for FP 0.8 glycosaminoglycan GAG 0.5 for human and 0.4 for FP and 0.03 DNA 0.008 for human and 0.02 for FP. Biomechanical testing revealed on average compressive relaxation modulus of 50 kPa 37 kPa for human and 32 kPa for FP compressive instantaneous modulus of 1121 kPa 1315 kPa for human and 1134 kPa for FP and coefficient of viscosity of 13 MPas 9 MPas for human and 3 MPas for FP at 20 strain. These properties also varied topographically in accordance to those of human and FP TMJ discs. Anisotropy quantified by bidirectional tensile testing and histology again was analogous among minipig human and FP TMJ discs. The minipig TMJs ginglymoarthrodial nature was verified through cone beam computer tomography. Collectively the similarities between minipig and human TMJ discs support the use of minipig as a relevant model for TMJ research considering the practical advantages conferred by its growth rate and size the minipig may be a preferred model over FP.",

METHODS In this feasibility proof-of-concept study 18F-NaF PET scan and CT scan were obtained on Hispaniolan Amazona ventralis and orange-winged Amazon parrots A amazonica. A different PET scan protocol was used for each species. Images were reviewed by 3 observers for arterial calcification and radiotracer uptake indicative of atherosclerosis. A blood lipid profile was also performed. A subset of Hispaniolan Amazon parrots were euthanized after completion of the study and the heart and arteries were collected for histopathology. RESULTS 10 adult Hispaniolan and 8 adult orange-winged Amazon parrots were scanned. Atherosclerotic lesions were detected on both CT and PET scan in various arteries. The presence of streak artifacts and increased noise on CT scan limited the ability to detect high-attenuation areas of arteries and obtain observer consensus except for 1 case of severe arterial calcification. PET scan was overall more sensitive had higher interobserver agreement in lesion scoring and detected a higher number of lesions in both species including in coronary arteries. On histopathology on 5 Amazon parrots the majority 56 of clinically relevant atherosclerotic lesions and some preatheromatous lesions 13 were identified on PET scan. No association between atherosclerosis detection on PET scan and the lipid profile was observed. CONCLUSIONS This study established a safe and effective protocol for 18F-NaF molecular imaging of psittacine atherosclerosis which proved to be more sensitive than CT scan. CLINICAL RELEVANCE 18F-sodium fluoride PET scan allows for a more reliable and earlier diagnosis of atherosclerotic lesions in Amazon parrots.",

Soil water chemistry in the deep vadose zone is first used to develop a chronology of paleohydrology and subsequently nitrogen fluxes. While elevated nitrogen concentrations as NO3 are commonly found in desert vadose zones NO3Cl ratios indicate that nitrate behaved conservatively beneath the active rooting zone. Mean nitrogen fluxes from the active root zone range from 103 to 108 mgm2yr and appear relatively constant over time in spite of dramatic climate and vegetation changes. The long-term loss of nitrogen from the active rooting zone implies that nitrogen cycling processes have been relatively constant since the PleistoceneHolocene transition that the biological community may not be primarily limited by the availability of nitrogen and that the loss of nitrogen into the vadose zone should be considered in desert ecosystem productivity studies.",

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 couples having a partner living with HIV and either hypertension or diabetes. Couples were recruited from HIV clinics in Malawi and were interviewed on beliefs around symptoms causation prevention and treatment for CMD. Data were analyzed at the individual and dyadic levels using framework analysis and Kleinmans theory of explanatory models as a lens. On average participants were 51 years old and married for 21 years. Approximately 57 14 and 80 had hypertension diabetes and HIV. Couples endorsed a combination of biomedical explanatory models beliefs around physical and mental health and traditional explanatory models beliefs around religion and natural remedies although tended to emphasize the biomedical model. Half of couples believed stress was the main cause of hypertension. For diabetes diet was believed to be a common cause. In terms of prevention dietary changes and physical activity were most frequently mentioned. For disease management medication adherence and diet modifications were emphasized with some couples also supporting herbal remedies stress reduction and faith in God as strategies. Participants were generally more concerned about CMD than HIV due to poor access to CMD medications and beliefs that CMD could lead to sudden death. Within couples partners often held many of the same beliefs but diverged around which etiological or preventive factors were most important e.g. stress versus diet and the best diet for CMD. Health education programs should involve primary partners to build knowledge of CMD and address overlap with HIV and reinforce accurate information on lifestyle factors for the prevention and treatment of CMD.",

Good AMD stewardship practices and judicious use of AMD are beneficial to the preservation of animal and human health from antimicrobial resistance threat. This study reports on changes in AMD use and stewardship practices on California CA dairies following the implementation of CA Senate Bill 27 SB 27 codified as Food and Agricultural Code FAC 14400-14408 here onward referred to as SB 27 by modeling the associations between management practices on CA conventional dairies and seven outcome variables relating to AMD use and stewardship practices following SB 27. METHODS A survey questionnaire was mailed to 1282 grade A licensed dairies in CA in spring of 2018. Responses from 132 conventional dairies from 16 counties were included for analyses. Multivariate logistic regression models were specified to explore the associations between survey factors and six outcome variables producers familiarity with the Food and Drug Administrations FDA Silver Spring WA USA medically important antimicrobial drugs MIAD term change in over-the-counter OTC AMD use initiation or increased use of alternatives to AMD changes to prevent disease outbreaks changes in AMD costs and better animal health post SB 27. We employed machine learning classification models to determine which of the survey factors were the most important predictors of good-excellent AMD stewardship practices of CA conventional dairy producers. RESULTS Having a valid veterinary-client-patient-relationship involving a veterinarian in training employees on treatment protocols and decisions on AMDs used to treat sick cows tracking milk andor meat withdrawal intervals for treated cows and participating in dairy quality assurance programs were positively associated with producers familiarity with MIADs. Use or increased use of alternatives to AMDs since 2018 was associated with decreased use of AMDs that were previously available OTC prior to SB 27. Important variables associated with good-excellent AMD stewardship knowledge by CA conventional dairy producers included having written or computerized animal health protocols keeping a drug inventory log awareness that use of MIADs required a prescription following implementation of SB 27 involving a veterinarian in AMD treatment duration determination and using selective dry cow treatment. CONCLUSIONS Our study identified management factors associated with reported AMD use and antimicrobial stewardship practices on conventional dairies in CA within a year from implementation of SB 27. Producers will benefit from extension outreach efforts that incorporate the findings of this survey by further highlighting the significance of these management practices and encouraging those that are associated with judicious AMD use and stewardship practices on CA conventional dairies.",

By difference spectroscopy we have suppressed the background signals from lipids and water and have resolved the CH3 resonance of lactate at 1.33 ppm. Moreover the technique is highly selective and allows us to select the CH3 resonance of alanine at 1.47 ppm in the presence of the CH3 resonance of lactate at 1.33 ppm even though the latter was much larger before editing. We have applied this technique to study the metabolic effect of ethanol in perfused mouse liver and have observed that the rate of formation of lactate from pyruvate is increased by a factor of 2.8 when ethanol is added.",

      "abstract": "Dairy farms generate a considerable amount of manure which is applied in cropland as fertilizer. While the use of manure as fertilizer reduces the application of chemical fertilizers the main concern with regards to manure application is microbial pollution. Manure is a reservoir of a broad range of microbial populations including pathogens which have potential to cause contamination and pose risks to public and animal health. Despite the widespread use of manure fertilizer the change in microbial diversity of manure under various treatment processes is still not well-understood. We hypothesize that the microbial population of animal waste changes with manure handling used in a farm environment. Consequential microbial risk caused by animal manure may depend on manure handling. In this study a reconnaissance effort for sampling dairy manure in California Central Valley followed by 16S rRNA analysis of content and diversity was undertaken to understand the microbiome of manure after various handling processes. The microbial community analysis of manure revealed that the population in liquid manure differs from that in solid manure. For instance the bacteria of genus Sulfuriomonas were unique in liquid samples while the bacteria of genus Thermos were observed only in solid samples. Bacteria of genus Clostridium were present in both solid and liquid samples. The population among liquid samples was comparable as was the population among solid samples. These findings suggest that the mode of manure application i.e. liquid versus solid could have a potential impact on the microbiome of cropland receiving manure as fertilizers.",

The much discussed site binding of calcium ions to these industrially relevant polymers is driven by an entropy gain as water molecules are released into the solution. At high NaPA concentrations increased Ca2-PA monomer ratios will not result in strong coiling of PA oligomers. This is due to the local rigidity induced by the binding of many Ca2 ions to the polymer. Because the uncoiled state of the crowded chain obstructs formation of high Ca2-COO- coordination numbers interchain interactions will become favorable and formation of PA aggregates can be expected. On the other hand at low NaPA concentrations introduction of Ca 2 ions to the solution leads to the formation of very stable coiled configurations with local crystal-like structures in which the Ca2 ions cluster together. It is the sharing of carboxylate groups among the metal ions that leads to the formation of these crystal-like conformations inducing desolvation and precipitation of the chain at threshold Ca2 concentrations. 2007 American Chemical Society.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States behind only heart disease and cancer. With an estimated three million survivors of stroke in the United States the cost to society both directly in health care and indirectly in lost income is staggering. Despite recent advances in basic and clinical neurosciences which have the potential to improve the treatment of acute stroke the general approach to the acute stroke patient remains one of therapeutic nihilism. Most basic science studies show that to be effective acute intervention to reperfuse ischemic tissue must take place within the first several hours as is the case with ischemic myocardium. In addition most neuroprotective agents must also be administered within a short time frame to be effective at salvaging at-risk tissue. Recent studies have suggested that the outcome after intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage is improved with early intervention. However most stroke patients fail to present to medical attention within this short window of opportunity. The publics knowledge about stroke is woefully inadequate. However clinicians who deal with stroke can use the dramatic changes in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction over the last 2 decades as a guide for shaping changes in the management of acute stroke. Comprehensive educational efforts aimed at clinicians and the public at large have dramatically reduced the time from symptom onset to presentation and treatment for acute myocardial infarction enabling treatment methods such as thrombolysis to be effective. The Decade of the Brain offers a unique opportunity to all concerned with the treatment of the patient with acute stroke to engage in a concerted effort to bring patients with a brain attack to specialized neurological attention within the same timeframe that the heart attack patient is handled. Such an effort is justified because although at the present time there are few therapeutic interventions of proven value in the treatment of acute stroke there is more than sufficient suggestive evidence that a number of approaches may be beneficial within the first few hours after the onset of the stroke.",

      "abstract": "We integrate new high-resolution aeromagnetic data with seismic reflection data well logs satellite remote sensing and field observations to provide a regional view of buried and exposed structures in the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen and to assess their potential for future seismicity. Trends ranging from NWSE to EW peaking at 330 4.5 and 280 3 dominate the magnetic lineaments of the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen reflecting basement contacts dikes and faults including a previously unmapped 100-km-long basement fault which is herein referred to as the Willow fault. The fault disrupts truncates and vertically offsets basement-related seismic reflectors and overlying Paleozoic strata up through the Permian reflectors. Surface deformation along the trend includes fault-parallel monoclinal folds pervasive fractures and fracture-hosted mud dikes in Permian evaporite units. These structures indicate a Permian or post-Permian reactivation of the fault. Along-strike the Willow fault connects to the NW-trending seismically active Meers Fault to comprise the 180-km-long Meers-Willow fault system which potentially represents a major seismic hazard along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen. Fault slip potential analyses of the mapped potential fault traces show that seismic hazards are elevated where faults have steeper dips. Given some uncertainty in the regional stress state we also show that hazards along the NWSE to EW trending faults vary considerably within the uncertainty range. We propose that the Meers-Willow fault system originated as a Cambrian aulacogen-scale basement-rooted fault that was later reactivated as a left-lateral strike-slip fault with 40 km displacement during the late Paleozoic Ancestral Rocky Mountain orogeny highlighting that lateral offset accommodated a major component of deformation during the orogen.",

Wherever they might put new housing neighborhood groups spring up and oppose it. The same groups will have money to spend or voters to turn out at the next election. Whats a well-meaning city councilperson to do Our answer Californias housing element process provides a way forward. California requires cities to periodically adopt a state-approved plan called a housing element which accommodates the citys share of regional housing need. These plans are reviewed and certified for compliance by the state Department of Housing and Community Development HCD. Cities across the state will adopt new housing elements between 2020 and 2022 guiding development for the next eight years. This process hasnt always worked well in the past but the legislature and HCD have recently strengthened the framework. There are now substantial political advantages for city officials to pursue pro-housing policies through their housing element rather than through the normal municipal lawmaking channels.",

Bupropion is crushed and insufflated to experience a high similar to that from amphetamines and cocaine. We sought to characterize the abuse of bupropion via insufflation in cases reported to the California Poison Control System CPCS and the incidence of seizures. METHODS An 11-year 2002-2012 retrospective observational case series of insufflated bupropion exposures evaluated in a health care facility HCF were reviewed after searching our database for all bupropion insufflation exposures. Patients with coingestants multiple exposure routes or age less than 18 were excluded. Data included age gender estimated bupropion dose occurrence of pre-HCF seizures symptoms and vital signs reported to the CPCS treatments and adverse events that occurred until time of discharge. RESULTS 74 cases were identified 1 excluded due to age 5 excluded due to additional oral ingestion of bupropion and 1 excluded due to being unable to follow. A total of 67 cases met inclusion criteria. The median age was 36 range 18-65 years. The total dose of bupropion insufflated was reported in 52 pts median dose of 1500 range 100-9000 mg. Eighteen cases 27 involved staggered or chronic exposures. Of the 67 patients 20 30 experienced a seizure prior to arrival at the HCF. Of these 19 patients 95 presented with tachycardia. None of these patients had a second seizure in the emergency department. There were no major medical outcomes and no deaths. Of the 67 patients 9 patients received benzodiazepines and 6 patients received single-dose activated charcoal. CONCLUSION The abuse of bupropion by crushing and insufflating through the nose is uncommon 672270 or 3.0 compared with that by oral bupropion exposures reported to CPCS. Seizures are common but are self-limited. Delayed seizures more than 8 h after exposure appear to be rare. Tachycardia is present in almost all patients who have seizures.",

To investigate we distinguish between differing rates of purchasing power parity PPP convergence conditional on alternative shocks which we refer to as conditional PPP. We find that the loss of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism after the introduction of the euro was more than compensated by the elimination of the exchange rate as a source of shocks in combination with faster adjustment in national prices.

However demand for statistical support at academic research centers can strain the capacity of biostatistics units. Our objective was to efficiently increase access to statistical expertise. METHODSSTUDY POPULATION In cooperation with the Cancer Center Biostatistics Shared Resource we replaced an informal 1-hour drop-in consultation program with structured office hours to provide statistical support to clinical and translational researchers at the University of California Davis Medical Center. We doubled office hours to 2 hours per week and established six 20-minute appointments. Two Ph.D. level statisticians staff office hours. Researchers schedule appointments through Acuity Scheduling a free on-line resource. Availability of the service is advertised monthly by sending an informational flyer to various university listservs. RESULTSANTICIPATED RESULTS Prior to implementing the program in 2014 we averaged 91 office hour consults per year. Subsequently consultations jumped to 171 in 2014 and have averaged 150 per year since then. Office hours attract students residents staff and faculty from a wide range of disciplines including the Schools of Medicine Nursing Veterinary Medicine and basic science departments.

Both his contemporary writings and later recollections of the period reveal a growing political consciousness and the formulation of a complex Arabism that was at odds with the dominant ideology emanating from the large cities of Syria. This ideology as embodied by the National Bloc government in Damascus was personality-based hamstrung by European colonial interests and unable to arouse any sustained political sensibility in the broader population it centered its political legitimacy and parochial brand of nationalism on opposition to the French occupation.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Until December 2021 the United States Food and Drug Administration impeded abortion access by restricting pharmacists from dispensing mifepristone one of two drugs used in medication abortion. This study aimed to explore pharmacists perspectives on dispensing mifepristone. METHODS We conducted semistructured interviews with pharmacists before and after participating in a pilot project where mifepristone was dispensed from their pharmacies. We thematically coded all interview transcripts then summarized emergent themes related to pharmacists support comfort experiences and concerns around dispensing mifepristone. RESULTS Between May 2018 and July 2020 we interviewed 29 pharmacists 22 at baseline and 15 at follow-up with 8 completing both interviews from 5 pharmacies. At both baseline and follow-up interviewees strongly supported pharmacists dispensing mifepristone feeling it would improve quality of care by providing more convenient medication abortion access and streamlined service delivery and take advantage of pharmacists expertise and availability. All pharmacists interviewed at follow-up reported dispensing mifepristone except two who were willing but did not have the opportunity. Pharmacists experienced few challenges dispensing mifepristone. Their main concern was perceived discomfort that other pharmacists and pharmacy staff may experience particularly in conservative areas or small pharmacies where pharmacists refusal to dispense mifepristone could impede abortion access. CONCLUSIONS Most pharmacists supported dispensing mifepristone and were comfortable doing so after education on mifepristone and medication abortion. They dispensed mifepristone without difficulty in a similar process as dispensing other medications. With the recent removal of U.S. Food and Drug Administration restrictions prohibiting it our findings support the feasibility of pharmacists dispensing mifepristone.",

OBJECTIVESGOALS Our objective is to conjugate hyaluronic acid binding peptides HABP to anionic hollow nanoparticle hNP and allowing the HABP-hNP complex to penetrate into osteoarthritic cartilage bind to exposed HA prevent further degradation and restore the compressive strength of articular cartilage. METHODSSTUDY POPULATION N-isopropyl acrylamide 2-acrylamindo-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid NN-bisacryoylcystamine and Acrylic Acid in fluorescent batches rhodamine b isothiocyanate RBITC were polymerized via precipitation reaction. HA binding peptide GAHWQFNALTVRGSG-Hydrazide GAH-Hyd was covalently bonded to the hNP using DMTMM chemistry. The reaction was halted by diluting the solution 101 with milliQ water and purified using tangential flow filtration. The dynamic viscosity of the six treatments were analyzed in a 70 kDa HA. Using a rheometer Discovery HR-3 with a 20 mm parallel plate geometry TA Instruments New Castle DE a frequency sweep 0.01 -1000 Hz 2.512 Pa was conducted to measure the storage modulus of each solution. RESULTSANTICIPATED RESULTS GAH-Hyd was successfully conjugated to the surface of the hNP and zeta-potential shows a significant increase in surface charge from -21.41 mV for unconjugated hNP to -8.94 mV for 65 GAH conjugated hNP confirming conjugation. The hNPs need 65 10 GAH per nanoparticle to significantly bind to HA shown by increasing the dynamic viscosity of the solution. The minimum concentration of 65 GAH-hNP required to significantly bind to HA is 313 M. These data from our study display the ability to functionalized the surface of polymeric hNPs with site specific peptides and their ability to bind to diseased tissue. We expect the GAH-hNP system will restore the compressive strength of OA cartilage and prevent further HA degradation in ex vivo aggrecan depleted cartilage plugs. DISCUSSIONSIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS Binding to exposed HA within the ECM of cartilage protects the HA from further degradation halting the progression of OA. 65 GAH-hNP binds to HA at a 313 M. Our system can be translated and used to treat a multitude of conditions by conjugating tissue specific peptides to the surface of our hNPs and delivery site specific therapeutics to diseases tissue.jatsp",

DESIGN Secondary analysis of a 36-month phase IV nonrandomized open-label observational study. PARTICIPANTS The study included 202 eyes from 159 patients who received the 0.19-mg FAc implant after a successful prior steroid challenge per the United States label indication. METHODS Study eyes were assessed for IOP values incidence of IOP elevations and best-corrected visual acuity BCVA for up to 36 months post-FAc implant. RESULTS Mean IOP was stable over 36 months post-FAc IOP change from baseline peaked at 2.12 mmHg at 9 months then declined to baseline levels. At 36 months eyes had a 32.5 cumulative probability of an IOP event 25 mmHg and a 15.6 probability of an IOP event 30 mmHg Kaplan-Meier. The probability of requiring IOP-lowering medication at any time by month 36 was 38.3. A total of 78 of eyes did not have IOP elevations 25 mmHg if similar values were seen with the previous steroid challenge. Although 7.4 of eyes had an IOP 30 mmHg during a scheduled study visit most exceeded this threshold only once 60. Regardless of IOP status mean BCVA remained stable. CONCLUSIONS Over 36 months the 0.19-mg FAc implant was associated with relatively stable IOPs in patients with DME and there was no significant impact of IOP elevations identified regarding their effects on long-term visual outcomes. The probability that a prior corticosteroid challenge will not predict an IOP elevation 25 mmHg over 36 months post-FAc is 22 therefore routine IOP monitoring should be scheduled.

      "abstract": "Recent advances have demonstrated that in the absence of postmating barriers to hybridization reproductive isolation between different forms of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto is maintained by strong assortative mating. The forms of An. gambiae s.s. and the sister species An. arabiensis commonly form mixed swarms in which they mate. This raises the question as to how individuals recognize mates of their own species or form within swarms. It has been proposed that wingbeat frequency is used as a cue to discriminate potential mates. This has important implications for prospective genetic control programs. We used a photosensor to record the transient waveforms generated by individuals An. arabiensis and from the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. as they flew through a beam of light. We found no significant between-species or between-form differences in the fundamental harmonic--equivalent to wingbeat frequency--either in males or females collected from sympatric populations in Mali West Africa. However there were significant differences in the amplitude of the first and third harmonics in females and of the first and second harmonics in males. Whereas these results suggest some morphological or behavioral differences between species and forms the extensive overlap in the distributions of harmonic amplitudes does not point to them as reliable cues for assortative mating. Combining all waveforms parameters into a discriminant analysis did not yield characteristic scores either for males or females. Thus our results do not support the wingbeat hypothesis of premating isolation in the An. gambiae complex.",

Patients vary in awareness of their depressive symptoms and ability to bring depression-related concerns to medical attention. OBJECTIVE To inform interventions to improve recognition and management of depression in primary care by understanding patients inner experiences prior to and during the process of seeking treatment. DESIGN Focus groups analyzed qualitatively. PARTICIPANTS One hundred and sixteen adults 79 response with personal or vicarious history of depression in Rochester NY Austin TX and Sacramento CA. Neighborhood recruitment strategies achieved sociodemographic diversity. APPROACH Open-ended questions developed by a multidisciplinary team and refined in three pilot focus groups explored participants lived experiences of depression depression-related beliefs influences of significant others and facilitators and barriers to care-seeking. Then 12 focus groups stratified by gender and income were conducted audio-recorded and analyzed qualitatively using codingediting methods. MAIN RESULTS Participants described three stages leading to engaging in care for depression - knowing recognizing that something was wrong naming finding words to describe their distress and explaining seeking meaningful attributions. Knowing is influenced by patient personality and social attitudes. Naming is affected by incongruity between the personal experience of depression and its narrow clinical conceptualizations colloquial use of the word depression and stigma. Explaining is influenced by the media socialization processes and social relations. Physicalmedical explanations can appear to facilitate care-seeking but may also have detrimental consequences. Other explanations characterological situational are common and can serve to either enhance or reduce blame of oneself or others. CONCLUSIONS To improve recognition of depression primary care physicians should be alert to patients ill-defined distress and heterogeneous symptoms help patients name their distress and promote explanations that comport with patients lived experience reduce blame and stigma and facilitate care-seeking.",

However little is known about floral scent chemistry involved in this interaction. Here we show that a sesquiterpene alcohol mediates attraction of Cyclocephala paraguayensis Arrow on bottle gourd flowers Lagenaria siceraria Cucurbitaceae. Both males and females started to aggregate on the flowers at twilight after that mating began and remained for the entire night. GC-FIDEAD analysis of the L. siceraria floral scent collected in the field revealed that only the major constituent of the airborne volatiles elicited electroantennographic responses on male and female antennae of C. paraguayensis. This compound was identified as 3S6E-nerolidol which was tested in two field trapping trials in Brazil. In the first bioassay traps baited with nerolidol mix of isomers captured significantly more adult C. paraguayensis than control traps. In the second field trial catches in traps baited with a mixture of isomers or enantiopure nerolidol were significantly higher than captures in control traps but the treatments did not differ significantly. Analysis from the gut content of adult C. paraguayensis showed the presence of pollen suggesting that they also use bottle gourd flowers for their nourishment. Taken together these results suggest that 3S6E-nerolidol plays an essential role in the reproductive behavior of C. paraguayensis by eliciting aggregation mating and feeding.",

Consequently representing Arctic tundra vegetation communities accurately requires very high resolution raster maps 5 m grid cell size. However using remotely sensed data to produce maps with sufficient spatial detail at an extent appropriate for understanding landscape-scale ecological patterns is challenging. In this study we used predictor layers derived from airborne lidar and high-resolution 5 cm 4-band airborne imagery to classify vegetation communities at 20 cm spatial resolution for three landscapes 12.5 km2 total near the Toolik Lake research area in the Alaskan Low Arctic. The maps were built using a Random Forest model that was trained and tested on 800 ground reference plots using classes derived from commonly used legends on existing polygon maps of the area. Withheld test plots 25 of dataset had a balanced map accuracy of 0.57 kappa of 0.47 and weighted fuzzy kappa of 0.65. These maps provide high-resolution plant community information that can serve as important baseline reference data for vegetation monitoring and change detection in this rapidly changing tundra ecosystem and as validation for coarser scale maps. They also permit fine-scale characterization of landscape phenomena such as community-level nutrient dynamics and wildlife habitat suitability in an important Arctic research site.

Our data do not support the supra-canonical 26Al27Al ratio of individual minerals or their mixtures in CV CAIs suggesting that the supra-canonical 26Al27Al ratio in the CV CAIs may have resulted from post-crystallization inter-mineral redistribution of Mg isotopes within an individual inclusion. This redistribution must be volumetrically minor in order to satisfy the mass balance of the precisely defined bulk CAI and bulk mineral data obtained by MC-ICP-MS. The radiogenic 208Pb206Pb ratio obtained as a by-product from the Pb-Pb age dating is used to estimate time-integrated 232Th238U ratio value of CAIs. Limited variations among the minerals within a single CAI contrasted by much larger variations among the bulk CAIs suggest ThU fractionation occurred prior to crystallization of igneous CAIs. If interpreted as primordial heterogeneity the value can be used to calculate the mean age of the interstellar dust from which the CAIs condensed. 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED Affective polarization is a key concern in America and other democracies. Although past evidence suggests some ways to minimize it there are no easily applicable interventions that have been found to work in the increasingly polarized climate. This project examines whether irrelevant factors or incidental happiness more specifically have the power to reduce affective polarization i.e. misattribution of affect or carryover effect. On the flip side happiness can minimize systematic processing thus enhancing beliefs in conspiracy theories and impeding individual ability to recognize deep fakes. Three preregistered survey experiments in the US Poland and the Netherlands total N 3611 induced happiness in three distinct ways. Happiness had no effects on affective polarization toward political outgroups and hostility toward various divisive social groups and also on endorsement of conspiracy theories and beliefs that a deep fake was real. Two additional studies in the US and Poland total N 2220 also induced anger and anxiety confirming that all these incidental emotions had null effects. These findings which emerged uniformly in three different countries among different partisan and ideological groups and for those for whom the inductions were differently effective underscore the stability of outgroup attitudes in contemporary America and other countries.

I then argue that while Unamuno may have misinterpreted Quental his misreading was nonetheless productive in that it furnished him with an Iberian exemplar of the sentimientotrgico de la vida though I contend that Unamunos elevation of Quental to the status of tragic exemplar is nonetheless misplacedjatsp",

Using speech codes theory we identified norms that govern when and how to talk about CRC in this population. RESULTS Our analyses revealed that male participants often avoided screening because they perceived it as emasculating whereas women often avoided screening because of embarrassment and past trauma resulting from sexual abuse. Both men and women used humor to mitigate the threatening nature of discussions about CRC and CRC screening.

The matching theories are non-Abelian gauge theories with dual quarks and baryons rather than the purely confining theories of baryons that t Hooft originally searched for. The matching gauge groups are required to have an F dimensional representation. Such a correspondence is reminiscent of Seibergs duality for supersymmetric SUSY QCD and these theories are candidates for non-SUSY duality. However anomaly matching by itself is not sufficiently restrictive and duality for QCD cannot be established at present. At the very least the existence of multiple anomaly matching solutions should provide a note of caution regarding conjectured non-SUSY dualities. 1998 The American Physical Society.",

The aim of this study was to determine trends in incidence and outcome 1-year mortality 28-day case-fatality in relation to management and risk factors for stroke in the multi-ethnic population of Auckland New Zealand NZ over 30-years. METHODS Four stroke incidence population-based register studies were undertaken in adult residents aged 15 years of Auckland NZ in 1981-1982 1991-1992 2002-2003 and 2011-2012. All used standard World Health Organization WHO diagnostic criteria and multiple overlapping sources of case-ascertainment for hospitalised and non-hospitalised fatal and non-fatal new stroke events. Ethnicity was consistently self-identified into four major groups. Crude and age-adjusted WHO world population standard annual incidence and mortality with corresponding 95 confidence intervals CI were calculated per 100000 people assuming a Poisson distribution. RESULTS 5400 new stroke patients were registered in four 12 month recruitment phases over the 30-year study period 79 were NZEuropean 6 Mori 8 Pacific people and 7 were of Asian or other origin. Overall stroke incidence and 1-year mortality decreased by 23 95 CI 5-31 and 62 95 CI 36-86 respectively from 1981 to 2012. Whilst stroke incidence and mortality declined across all groups in NZ from 1991 Mori and Pacific groups had the slowest rate of decline and continue to experience stroke at a significantly younger age mean ages 60 and 62 years respectively compared with NZEuropeans mean age 75 years. There was also a decline in 28-day stroke case fatality overall by 14 95 CI 11-17 across all ethnic groups from 1981 to 2012. However there were significant increases in the frequencies of pre-morbid hypertension myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus but a reduction in frequency of current smoking among stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS In this unique temporal series of studies spanning 30 years stroke incidence early case-fatality and 1-year mortality have declined but ethnic disparities in risk and outcome for stroke persisted suggesting that primary stroke prevention remains crucial to reducing the burden of this disease.",

Families in Vietnam provide most of the care for persons living with dementia yet our understanding of their experiences and needs is limited. This study examined the family caregiving experience in a semi-rural region outside of central Hanoi from the perspectives of family caregivers and other key informants. MATERIALS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 key stakeholders 12 family caregivers and 9 healthcare providers and community leaders. A descriptive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS Qualitative data analysis revealed four themes related to the family caregiving experience 1 perceptions of dementia symptoms as a normal part of aging rather than a disease 2 caregiving as a moral and expected familial obligation 3 patterns of caregiving that are heavily influenced by both gender and sibling order and 4 multiple challenges or hardships including time constraints loss of income increased social isolation a toll on their perceived physical health and emotional distress. Caregivers rejected the notion that caregiving was a burden and expressed their distress through terms such as frustration sadness and exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS In this low-resource setting the stress of family caregiving may be amplified by lack of community resources cultural stigma discouraging outside help-seeking and economic impact of care provision. The study highlights the vulnerability and predicament of Vietnamese women who often face multiple challenges in their caregiving role as well as the urgent need for the development of community-based programs and supports.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Racial inequities in maternal and child health outcomes persist Black women and birthing people experience higher rates of adverse outcomes than their white counterparts. Similar inequities are seen in coronavirus disease COVID-19 mortality rates. In response we sought to explore the intersections of racism and the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the daily lives and perinatal care experiences of Black birthing people. METHODS We used an intrinsic case study approach grounded in an intersectional lens to collect stories from Black pregnant and postpartum people residing in Fresno County July-September 2020. All interviews were conducted on Zoom without video and were audio recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to group codes into larger themes. RESULTS Of the 34 participants included in this analysis 76.5 identified as Black only and 23.5 identified as multiracial including Black. Their mean age was 27.2 years SD 5.8. Nearly half 47 reported being married or living with their partner all were eligible for Medi-Cal insurance. Interview times ranged from 23 to 96 min. Five themes emerged 1 Tensions about Heightened Exposure of Black Lives Matter Movement during the pandemic 2 Fear for Black Sons Safety 3 Lack of Communication from Health Care Professionals 4 Disrespect from Health Care Professionals and 5 Misunderstood or Judged by Health Care Professionals. Participants stressed that the Black Lives Matter Movement is necessary and highlighted that society views their Black sons as a threat. They also reported experiencing unfair treatment and harassment while seeking perinatal care. CONCLUSIONS Black women and birthing people shared that exposure to racism has heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic increasing their levels of stress and anxiety. Understanding how racism impacts Black birthing peoples lives and care experiences is critical to reforming the police force and revising enhanced prenatal care models to better address their needs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Face cleanliness is a core component of the SAFE Surgery Antibiotics Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvements strategy for trachoma control. Understanding knowledge attitudes and behaviors related to face washing may be helpful for designing effective interventions for improving facial cleanliness. METHODS In April 2014 a mixed methods study including focus groups and a quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted in the East Gojjam zone of the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Participants were asked about face washing practices motivations for face washing use of soap which may reduce bacterial load and fly control strategies. RESULTS Overall both knowledge and reported practice of face washing was high. Participants reported they knew that washing their own face and their childrens faces daily was important for hygiene and infection control. Although participants reported high knowledge of the importance of soap for face washing quantitative data revealed strong variations by community in the use of soap for face washing ranging from 4.4 to 82.2 of households reporting using soap for face washing. Cost and forgetfulness were cited as barriers to the use of soap for face washing. Keeping flies from landing on children was a commonly cited motivator for regular face washing as was trachoma prevention. CONCLUSIONS Interventions aiming to improve facial cleanliness for trachoma prevention should focus on habit formation to address forgetfulness and address barriers to the use of soap such as reducing cost. Interventions that focus solely on improving knowledge may not be effective for changing face-washing behaviors.",

      "abstract": "China implemented strict emission control measures in Beijing and surrounding regions to ensure good air quality during the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation APEC summit. We conducted synchronous aerosol particle measurements with two aerosol mass spectrometers at different heights on a meteorological tower in urban Beijing to investigate the variations in particulate composition sources and size distributions in response to emission controls. Our results show consistently large reductions in secondary inorganic aerosol SIA of 61-67 and 51-57 and in secondary organic aerosol SOA of 55 and 37 at 260 m and ground level respectively during the APEC summit. These changes were mainly caused by large reductions in accumulation mode particles and by suppression of the growth of SIA and SOA by a factor of 2-3 which led to blue sky days during APEC commonly referred to as APEC Blue. We propose a conceptual framework for the evolution of primary and secondary species and highlight the importance of regional atmospheric transport in the formation of severe pollution episodes in Beijing. Our results indicate that reducing the precursors of secondary aerosol over regional scales is crucial and effective in suppressing the formation of secondary particulates and mitigating PM pollution.",

      "abstract": "PROBLEM Academic medical centers struggle with the high cost of care reduced reimbursement intense competition and low profit margins. Many factors including a high proportion of publicly insured patients a model rewarding procedural specialties and research and educational support burden led to faculty salary inequities physician disengagement and difficulty recruiting. APPROACH UC Davis Health implemented an aligned funds flow model in July 2021 to create a mission-aligned model in which all departments had financial margins to optimize recruitment retention research and teaching. OUTCOMES The 3-year experience academic years 2021-2024 with this model at UC Davis Health was characterized by physician compensation physician recruitment and profit increases. Total collections for departments increased by 4 in the first year 0.2 in the second year and 11.3 in the third year of funds flow. Total productivity increased by 4.9 during the first year 3.6 during the second year and 8.4 during the third year. Salaries increased in all departmental categories in year 3. Productivity and collections per faculty member increased during the first year and were stable during the second and third years. Parity among procedural primary care and hospital-based service lines was improved because departmental revenue was agnostic to payer mix and hospital agreements were more formulaic. The hospital contribution to funds flow increased from 67 million in 2022 to 101 million in 2024. NEXT STEPS Regular communication and transparency are critical to ongoing trust and success with implementation of sustaining funds flow. The new model resulted in improved physician compensation and increased hiring. However the implementation of funds flow had a negative fiscal effect on the academic medical center and sustainability may require fine-tuning to balance affordability. The authors plan to convert outpatient primary care to productivity-based models and decrease time-limited support for new faculty from 2 years to 1 year.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the role that physical design plays in shaping womens everyday experiences in public space by studying gender differences in the use of a 1.3-acre urban park in a specific cultural enclave. Through direct observation behavior mapping and quantitative analysis the project reveals an obvious gender separation of space usage in Portsmouth Square in the Chinatown district of San Francisco California. In-depth interviews exposed a range of reasons for this separation and revealed how some Chinese immigrants construct and negotiate their social dynamics and territoriality on the urban square. The findings reaffirm that men and women often have different preferences in open spaces as well as different concepts of optimum public space experiences. Results also indicate that observed segregation by gender is not all voluntary. In this case besides the known factors such as cultural and social norms physical space design is important in shaping womens use of public space perpetuating and even intensifying gender separation and inequity. This study addresses and highlights some spatial elements that can be easily overlooked by landscape architects and environmental planners. It argues that to create a gender-inclusive-or at a minimum genderaware- public space designers must consider not only the differences of ability movement and designated spots but also barriers interruptions and spaces avoided or inaccessible by specific populations.",

Additionally 48.8 of dairy producers included a veterinarian in their decision on which AMDs were used to treat sick cows. The majority 96.8 of dairy producers were aware that all uses of medically important AMDs require a prescription. Approximately 49 of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that AMD use in livestock does not cause problems in humans.

      "abstract": "Adopting a Civil Sphere Theory framework we argue that Taiwans efforts at containing COVID-19 resulted from its societalization of pandemic unpreparedness which was triggered by the 2003 SARS outbreak and resumed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Societalization refers to the process through which institutional failures are transformed into societal crises with the civil sphere mobilized to discuss institutional dysfunctions push for reforms and attempt to democratize or otherwise transform institutional cultures. The societalization of pandemic unpreparedness in Taiwan led to reforms of the public health administration and the medical profession thereby establishing state mechanisms for encouraging early responses and coordinating centralized command during outbreaks and healthcare infrastructures for coordinating patient transfer and ensuring supplies of personal protective equipment. Reflections upon past uncivil acts among citizens motivated the civil sphere to foster a discourse of interdependence redefining the boundaries between individual choices and civic virtues. Meanwhile unaddressed challenges remained including threats related to Taiwans political polarization. Our paper challenges the thesis of authoritarian advantage highlighting how democratic societies can foster social preparedness to respond to crises. By illustrating how societalization can reach temporary closures but become reactivated subsequently our study extends the theory of societalization by explicating its historical dimension.",

We studied the implementation of social risk screening in Texas CHCs to inform best practices and understand equity implications. METHODS Convergent mixed methods of 3 data sources. Using interviews and surveys with CHC providers and staff we explored social risk screening practices to identify barriers and facilitators we used electronic health record EHR data to assess screening reach and disparities in screening. RESULTS Across 4 urbansuburban Texas CHCs we conducted 27 interviews 15 providers12 staff and collected 97 provider surveys 2 CHCs provided EHR data on 18672 patients screened during the study period. Data revealed 2 cross-cutting themes 1 there was broad support for social risk screeningcare integration that was rooted in CHCs mission and positionalities and 2 barriers to social risk screening efforts were largely a result of limited time and staffing. Though EHR data showed screens per month and screensencounters increased peri-pandemic 4.1 of encounters in 82019 to 46.1 in 22021 there were significant differences in screening rates by patient raceethnicity and preferred language P .001. In surveys 90.0 of surveyed providers reported incorporating social risk screening into patient conversations 28.6 were unaware their clinic had an embedded screening tool. CONCLUSIONS Study CHCs were in the early stages of standardizing social risk screening. Differences in screening reach by patient demographics raise concerns that social screening initiatives which often serve as a path to resourceservice connection might exacerbate disparities. Overcoming barriers to reach sustainability and equity requires supports targeted to program designdevelopment workforce capacity and quality improvement.",

      "issued": "2014-12-01",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Violence against indigenous women and girls is endemic yet the absence of research on the consequences of this violence from the perspectives of women presents a profound barrier to the development of knowledge along with violence prevention and mitigation. Although family is central to many indigenous communities existing research typically examines the consequences of intimate partner violence IPV on women or children in isolation rather than examining its consequences holistically. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to identify US indigenous womens perspectives about the impact of IPV on women children and families. METHOD Data were collected with 29 indigenous women affected by violence from a Southeastern tribe in the United States. As part of a larger critical ethnography pragmatic horizon analysis of life history interviews revealed the consequences of IPV across multiple levels. RESULTS Women reported profound psychological consequences resulting from IPV. The majority of women had witnessed IPV in their childhood providing support for an intergenerational cycle of violence. Women reported psychological consequences on children which paralleled those reported by women leaving deep impressions on children across their life course. Consequences on children and whole families were extensive indicating the negative ramifications of IPV transcended personal boundaries and affected children and families across multiple generations. CONCLUSIONS Given the tight-knit nature of indigenous families and communities the consequences across individuals and families were noteworthy. However a dearth in research examining consequences of IPV across levels fails to capture the interconnections of consequences for women children and families. Given the centrality of family in many indigenous communities examining IPV from a holistic perspective that incorporates multiple levels is recommended for IPV research and intervention development.",

A high-throughput LCMS-ELSD based library approach of the extract in combination with the NF-B and MTT assays revealed the styryl lactone -altholactone 2 was responsible for the activity. Compound 2 its acetylated derivate -3-O-acetylaltholactone 3 and the major compound of this class -goniothalmin 1 were further evaluated to determine their anti-inflammatory potential in the NF-B assay. Concentration-response studies of 1-3 indicated that only 2 possessed NF-B based anti-inflammatory activity. Compound 2 reduced the LPS-induced NO production phosphorylation of IB and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 using Western blot analysis. Further studies using qPCR indicated 2 reduced the expression of eight pro-inflammatory cytokinesenzymes 0.8-5.0M which included COX-2 iNOS IP-10 IL-1 MCP-1 GCS-F IL-6 and IFN-. These results indicated that 2 displays broad spectrum immune modulating activity by functioning as an anti-inflammatory agent against LPS-induced NF-B signaling.

The sex-specific performance of this instrument was explored on 1088 male and 352 female patients 18 years or older admitted with blunt or penetrating trauma during a 30-month period to a regional level one trauma center in Seattle Washington USA. The sum of the differentially weighted alcohol markers WAM determined from one blood sample formed a score continuum ranging from 0 to 24. The WAM scores distributed themselves across the trauma population with higher WAM scores being correlated to higher screening instrument scores for alcohol problems. By using two of the best established screening tests for alcohol problems CAGE and SMAST to define cut-off points for likely alcohol abusedependence the WAM score of or 7 in males showed 75 sensitivity and 83 specificity whereas the WAM score of or 6 for females displayed 85 sensitivity and 85 specificity. We conclude that a weighted combination of biological alcohol markers WAM score is a useful tool for identifying alcohol problems among trauma patients.

Perchloric acid extraction and deproteinization of this fraction permitted subsequent analysis of nucleotide identity and content by high performance liquid chromatography. PC12 cells grown in the absence of nerve growth factor NGF contained ADP ATP GDP and GTP at levels consistent with the actin and tubulin content of the cytoskeletal fraction. Microtubules from PC12 cells cultured in the presence of NGF contain an additional nucleotide that we have identified as dGTP. Analysis of whole cell nucleotide extracts from PC12 cells grown in the absence or presence of NGF revealed no evidence for the presence of dGTP at 4 and 14 days respectively. We have determined that embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion neurons also contain this deoxyribonucleotide and we found virtually no ADP or ATP in the extracted dorsal root ganglion cytoskeletal fraction. On the basis of metabolic labeling studies with 14C guanine we have inferred that the presence of dGTP in NGF-treated PC12 cells probably arises either from binding to the nonexchangeable nucleotide site of tubulin undergoing dynamic assemblydisassembly or from binding to the exchangeable site of tubulin subsequently incorporated into highly stabilized microtubules.",

We find that about 50 of cities reported dubious PM10 pollution levels that led to a discontinuity at the cut-off. Suspicious data reporting tends to occur on days when the anomaly is least detectable. Our findings indicate that the official daily air pollution data are not well behaved which provides suggestive evidence of manipulation.",

Future policy actions will benefit from improved understanding of the interactions and health effects of different chemical species and source categories. Achieving this new understanding requires air pollution scientists and engineers to work increasingly closely with health scientists. In particular research is needed to better understand the chemical and physical properties of complex air pollutant mixtures and to use new observations provided by satellites advanced in situ measurement techniques and distributed micro monitoring networks coupled with models to better characterize air pollution exposure for epidemiological and toxicological research and to better quantify the effects of specific source sectors and mitigation strategies.",

We report here the first discovery of a gravitational lens from the survey 1608656 a quadruply imaged object with a maximum separation of 2i. Images from the Palomar 5 m and Keck 10 m telescopes show the lensed images and the lensing galaxy. An optical spectrum obtained with the Palomar 5 m telescope indicates a redshift of z 0.6304 for the lensing galaxy. No conclusive redshift for the lensed object has been determined although a single strong emission line is found at 9240 in the Keck low-resolution imaging spectrograph spectrum. The two most likely identifications for this line are H z 0.90 and Mg II z 2.30. The preliminary lens model derived from the radio image reproduces the observed configuration and relative fluxes of the images as well as the position shape and orientation of the lensing galaxy. Because a simple mass model is able to fit the observations we argue that this lens system is promising for determining H0. 1995 The American Astronomical Society.",

This study examines water costs of informal sources and overall affordability disparities for two communities of different socioeconomic status in Beirut Lebanon. Water is often unaffordable for both of these communities. Overall 6 of household income is spent on purchasing water compared to an average global percentages of 3 to 5. There are also significant disparities between the communities lower income residents pay 2.2 times more of their income to secure water and more than half of these residents 55 of households spend more than 5 of their income on water. To overcome water shortages these residents turn to informal water sources but at significant additional cost. These costs and impacts on lower income residents are high and inequitable. We propose strategies to address cost quality and quantity issues for informal sources.",

Timely diagnosis and surgical intervention is essential to optimize functional outcomes for patients with CSM. Here we compared patients who were admitted through clinic versus the emergency department ED for surgical management of DCM. METHODSSTUDY POPULATION Patients aged 18 years admitted for surgery for DCM through clinic elective cohort were compared to a surgical cohort who were evaluated through the ED call cohort. Basic demographics included age gender race ethnicity and insurance payor. Sociodemographic characteristics were estimated using the Social Deprivation Index SDI and the Area Deprivation Index ADI for the state of California which were obtained through aggregated Zip Code Tabulation Area ZCTA. Cervical MRI was reviewed to assess severity of spinal cord compression. Other outcomes included number of motion segments operated on functional outcome using the Nurick classification length of stay LOS disposition and 30-day reoperation and readmission rates. RESULTSANTICIPATED RESULTS From 2015 to 2021 327 DCM patients received surgery 227 Elective Cohort 100 Call Cohort. Elective cohort was mainly female 48.0 vs 30.0 p0.002 and white 72.7 vs 51.0 p0.0001. Call cohort was mainly uninsuredcovered by MedicareMedicaid 78.0 vs 67.0 p0.04 had higher SDI 68.0 vs 56.2 p0.0003 ADI 7.9 vs 7.2 p0.009 and cervical cord compression on MRI 78.0 vs 42.3 Grade III p DISCUSSIONSIGNIFICANCE Compared to DCM patients undergoing elective surgery those admitted through the ED were more likely to be male non-White and socioeconomically disadvantaged as measured by SDI and ADI. Postoperative outcomes were less favorable for these patients including longer hospital stay discharge disposition and less Nurick grading improvement.jatsp",

      "abstract": "We characterize the 3D spatial variations of FeH MgH and MgFe in stars at the time of their formation across 11 simulated Milky Way MW-and M31-mass galaxies in the FIRE-2 simulations to inform initial conditions for chemical tagging. The o v erall scatter in FeH within a galaxy decreased with time until 7 Gyr ago after which it increased to today This arises from a competition between a reduction of azimuthal scatter and a steepening of the radial gradient in abundance o v er time. The radial gradient is generally ne gativ e and it steepened o v er time from an initially flat gradient 12 Gyr ago. The strength of the present-day abundance gradient does not correlate with when the disc settled instead it best correlates with the radial velocity dispersion within the galaxy. The strength of azimuthal variation is nearly independent of radius and the 360 deg scatter decreased over time from 0 . 17 dex at t lb 11 . 6 Gyr to 0 . 04 dex at present-day . Consequently stars at t lb 8 Gyr formed in a disc with primarily azimuthal scatter in abundances. All stars formed in a vertically homogeneous disc FeH 0 . 02 dex within 1 kpc of the galactic mid-plane with the exception of the young stars in the inner 4 kpc at z 0. These results generally agree with our previous analysis of gas-phase elemental abundances which reinforces the importance of cosmological disc evolution and azimuthal scatter in the context of stellar chemical tagging. We provide analytic fits to our results for use in chemical-Tagging analyses.",

Towards this end the law specifically mandates a 75 reduction of organic waste including food waste FW from landfills by 2025. However current infrastructural capacity to treat this diverted organic waste is limited throughout the state so new facilities will need to be built to treat these valuable waste flows. The purpose of this study is to investigate ideal size and scale of new facilities that maximize FW treatment and minimize GHG emissions. To do so this study uses a case study of Los Angeles County to model a decentralized network of small-scale containerized anerobic digestors ADs for treatment of FW in the region. A spatial FW dataset developed for this study is used with a novel iterative-descent clustering model to simulate potential FW-sheds of ADs using Geographic Information Systems GIS. Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate a range of model results and a GHG analysis of FW collection is used to compare systems of two different AD capacities. The results of this analysis show that food waste is ideal for recycling at relatively small spatial scales as hauling burden of FW is reduced in these systems. The proposed infrastructure modeling approach is a first step of developing a zero net energy infrastructural solution that promotes a circular economy of food in direct response to SB 1383 and more broadly global climate change.",

We examined bisphosphonate response and its association with serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D 25OHD level in a real world setting. Serum 25OHD level was strongly associated with maintaining bisphosphonate response arguing that vitamin D may be involved in optimizing prolonged bisphosphonate therapy. INTRODUCTION This study examined the maintenance of bisphosphonate response in the real world setting and the association between 25OHD and bisphosphonate response using an established composite definition of response. METHODS Postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density BMD treated with bisphosphonates were identified from two New York City practices. Patients were excluded for a history of chronic steroid use metabolic bone disease or bisphosphonate non-adherence. Patients were categorized as bisphosphonate non-responders if they had a T-score -3 that persisted between dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry DEXA scans a 3 decrease in BMD or an incident fracture on bisphosphonate therapy criteria based on the EUROFORS trial. Demographic and clinical data including mean 25OHD levels between DEXA scans were obtained. Mean 25OHD levels were compared between responders and non-responders and multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with non-response. RESULTS A total of 210 patients were studied. A favorable response to bisphosphonate therapy was seen in 47 N 99210. Patients with a mean 25OHD 33 ngml had a 4.5-fold greater odds of a favorable response P 0.0001. 25OHD level was significantly associated with response - a 1 ngml decrease in 25OHD was associated with 5 decrease in odds of responding odds ratio 0.95 95 confidence interval 0.92-0.98 P 0.0006. CONCLUSIONS Patients with a mean 25OHD 33 ngml had a substantially greater likelihood of maintaining bisphosphonate response. This threshold level of 25OHD is higher than that considered adequate by the Institute of Medicine arguing that higher levels may be required for specific therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The objective is to update recommendations for prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis GIOP for patients with rheumatic or nonrheumatic conditions receiving 3 months treatment with glucocorticoids GCs 2.5 mg daily. METHODS An updated systematic literature review was performed for clinical questions on nonpharmacologic pharmacologic treatments discontinuation of medications and sequential therapy. Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A Voting Panel achieved 70 consensus on the direction for or against and strength strong or conditional of recommendations. RESULTS For adults beginning or continuing 3 months of GC treatment we strongly recommend as soon as possible after initiation of GCs initial assessment of fracture risks with clinical fracture assessment bone mineral density with vertebral fracture assessment or spinal x-ray and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool if 40 years old. For adults at medium high or very high fracture risk we strongly recommend pharmacologic treatment. Choice of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates denosumab or parathyroid hormone analogs should be made by shared decision-making. Anabolic agents are conditionally recommended as initial therapy for those with high and very high fracture risk. Recommendations are made for special populations including children people with organ transplants people who may become pregnant and people receiving very high-dose GC treatment. New recommendations for both discontinuation of osteoporosis therapy and sequential therapies are included. CONCLUSION This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions for management of GIOP. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.",

      "abstract": "Recently an analytic method was developed to study in the large N limit non-Hermitian random matrices that are drawn from a large class of circularly symmetric non-Gaussian probability distributions thus extending the existing Gaussian non-Hermitian literature. One obtains an explicit algebraic equation for the integrated density of eigenvalues from which the Greens function and averaged density of eigenvalues could be calculated in a simple manner. Thus that formalism may be thought of as the non-Hermitian analog of the method due to Brzin Itzykson Parisi and Zuber for analyzing Hermitian non-Gaussian random matrices. A somewhat surprising result is the so called single ring theorem namely that the domain of the eigenvalue distribution in the complex plane is either a disk or an annulus. In this article we extend previous results and provide simple new explicit expressions for the radii of the eigenvalue distribution and for the value of the eigenvalue density at the edges of the eigenvalue distribution of the non-Hermitian matrix in terms of moments of the eigenvalue distribution of the associated Hermitian matrix. We then present several numerical verifications of the previously obtained analytic results for the quartic ensemble and its phase transition from a disk shaped eigenvalue distribution to an annular distribution. Finally we demonstrate numerically the single ring theorem for the sextic potential namely the potential of lowest degree for which the single ring theorem has nontrivial consequences. 2001 American Institute of Physics.",

The particle saltation theoreticalnumerical model follows a Lagrangian approach and addresses the motion of sediment particles in an open channel flow described by a logarithmic velocity profile. The model is validated with experimental data obtained from the literature. In order to evaluate the importance of the phenomenon simulations with and without particle-particle collisions were carried out. Results for two different sediment concentrations are presented namely 0. 13 and 2.33. For each concentration of particles three different flow intensities were considered and trajectories of two different particle sizes within the sand range were computed. Changes in particle rotation particle velocity and angle of trajectory before and after particle-particle collisions appear to be relatively important at lower shear stresses whereas they decrease in significance with increasing flow intensities. Analyses of the evolution in time of the second order moment of particle location suggest that inter-particle collisions introduce transverse diffusion in saltating particles in the span-wise direction. 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.",

As such blueprinting represents a recent manifestation of regionalist approaches to environmental policy and planning. Focusing on the Sacramento region an early adopter of blueprint planning we use archival data and media sources to reconstruct the development of blueprinting and then we turn to an analysis of the performance of the blueprinting approach in relation to three successive planning efforts. We find that despite the promise of blueprinting very little progress has been made toward actually changing the regional transportation system and land use patterns. The net result of this long-term planning effort aimed at achieving sustainable transportation land use is that total CO2 emissions increase over time at historical rates. We close with a discussion of what this means for regional planning and achieving goals set by Californias landmark climate change legislation.",

The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of residents who have been highly productive in scholarship. METHODS We performed a qualitative study using a constructivist-interpretivist paradigm and conducted semistructured interviews at seven Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited emergency medicine residency programs in the United States. We included sites of diverse locations and training formats PGY-1 to -4 vs. PGY-1 to -3. Program leadership identified residents with high levels of scholarly productivity at their institutions. We used purposive sampling to seek out residents with diversity in gender and PGY level. Two researchers independently performed a thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Discrepancies were resolved through in-depth discussion and negotiated consensus. RESULTS We invited 14 residents and all consented to be interviewed. Residents felt scholarship enhanced their knowledge and skills grew collaborative networks and provided personal fulfillment and external rewards. Scholarship positively impacted their careers by focusing their professional interests and informing career decisions. Participants identified individual and institutional facilitators of success including personal prior knowledge and skills project management skills mindset protected time mentorship and leadership support. Challenges to conducting scholarship included lack of time expertise and resources. Participants acknowledged that participating in scholarly activities was hard work and recommended that residents seek out quality mentorship work on projects that they are passionate start early and be persistent in their efforts. Participants advice to faculty supporting resident scholarship included recommendations to allow resident autonomy of projects provide scholarly opportunities and be responsive to trainee needs.

In addition to these technical analyses in this article we argue that structurally disadvantaged populations have a wealth of lived experiences that should be valued as lived expertise in the construction of transportation knowledge both for holistic understandings of actually experienced accessibility and in alignment with epistemic justice. Through Chicago-based focus group research we find that individualized identities and community contexts combine in complicated ways that are challenging to fully capture in aggregated models. Findings also demonstrate that knowledge of inequitable accessibility and its ties to spatial inequities and the transportation system is common based on lived experience and results in continual adaptations among majority Black and Latine low- and moderate-income participants. Beyond the pragmatic need for lived expertise to adequately illuminate individual experiences beyond aggregated quantitative accessibility models we argue a reframing to acknowledge lived expertise is critical on normative grounds for enhancing epistemic justice in transportation discourse.",

      "abstract": "The 12th International Workshops on Opportunistic Protists IWOP-12 was held in August 2012 in Tarrytown New York. The objectives of the IWOP meetings are to 1 serve as a forum for exchange of new information among active researchers concerning the basic biology molecular genetics immunology biochemistry pathogenesis drug development therapy and epidemiology of these immunodeficiency-associated pathogenic eukaryotic microorganisms that are seen in patients with AIDS and 2 foster the entry of new and young investigators into these underserved research areas. The IWOP meeting focuses on opportunistic protists e.g. the free-living amoebae Pneumocystis Cryptosporidium Toxoplasma the Microsporidia and kinetoplastid flagellates. This conference represents the major conference that brings together research groups working on these opportunistic pathogens. Slow but steady progress is being achieved on understanding the biology of these pathogenic organisms their involvement in disease causation in both immune-deficient and immune-competent hosts and is providing critical insights into these emerging and reemerging pathogens. This IWOP meeting demonstrated the importance of newly developed genomic level information for many of these pathogens and how analysis of such large data sets is providing key insights into the basic biology of these organisms. A great concern is the loss of scientific expertise and diversity in the research community due to the ongoing decline in research funding. This loss of researchers is due to the small size of many of these research communities and a lack of appreciation by the larger scientific community concerning the state of art and challenges faced by researchers working on these organisms.",

      "abstract": "A Re-containing sample is irradiated with thermal neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The following reactions occur with high cross sections 185Ren 186Re and 187Ren 188Re. Both 186Re half-life 90.6 h and 188Re 16.7 h -decay to the stable isotopes 186Os and 188Os. Thus 186Os and 188Os are enriched in proportion to the neutron fluence and ReOs ratio of the sample being irradiated. Analysing merely the isotopic composition of the sample we get two ages that should be consistent. In one irradiated molybdenite sample from Kingsgate molybdenum mine in New South Wales Australia the measured 186Os 192Os and 188Os 192Os are 0.3284 and 0.6299 whereas in an unirradiated sample they are assumed to be 0.0390 and 0.3248. These ratios are measurable with negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry N-TIMS to a precision of 1. The derived ages for this sample are t186 220.5 8.7 Ma and t188 214.9 8.9 Ma respectively or 1.4 Ma and 1.7 Ma respectively when excluding the uncertainty of 187Re half-life. These values are in close agreement with the 221-238 Ma K-Ar ages of the leucogranites emplacement that causes the Mo mineralization at Kingsgate Evernden and Richards 1962 Kleeman 1988 Gilligan and Barnes 1990. The major limiting factor on the precision of this age determination is the uncertainty in the half-life of 187Re. The errors associated with the irradiation parameters are greatly reduced by choosing an appropriate neutron flux monitor. The advantage of this method is that the Re Os ratio is determined on the same sample and that only one measurement of the isotopic composition of osmium is required thus overcoming some of the experimental difficulties of the conventional Re-Os analysis. The problem of sample inhomogeneity which is a serious problem for the Re-Os system and the need to measure the absolute concentrations of rhenium and osmium are thus eliminated. With this method it is potentially possible to obtain an age spectrum of the disturbed Re-Os system with selective leaching steps or by in situ analysis. 1993.",

This study explored the beliefs of older Chinese Americans toward colorectal cancer screening modalities including fecal occult blood testing FOBT. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted 30 semistructured open-ended qualitative interviews in Mandarin and Cantonese focusing on colorectal cancer prevention and health-seeking behavior. Participants were Chinese patients 50-79 years of age recruited from a community clinic in Seattle Washington. RESULTS When asked about colorectal cancer prevention interviewees discussed such concepts as maintenance of positive energy qi and spirit jing shen and moderation of exercise and diet. Until prompted participants did not discuss FOBT. Interviewees believed that colorectal cancer was caused by diets high in foods with heat huo qi or by intestinal toxins from frequent constipation. Participants presumed that FOBT is unnecessary in the absence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Patients in our study expressed beliefs about health promotion and causes of colorectal cancer that differed from Western biomedical concepts. Failure to recognize these different beliefs may create inadvertent confusion among elderly Chinese-American patients. Health promotion programs to increase colorectal cancer screening must incorporate these concepts to improve cultural relevance among Chinese-American patients.",

A questionnaire was used to gather information about the participants exposure to environmental factors. Saliva samples werecollected from 349 participants. Newborn dried blood spotsfrom probands and parents are still being collected from the California New born Registry. DNA was extracted from 349 saliva samples from 85 families and subjected to whole genome bisulfite sequencing WGBS to analyze DNA methylation. Sequence alignments and bioinformatic analyses will be performed using R packages called DMRichR and Comethyl. RESULTSANTICIPATED RESULTS Sequence alignments and bioinformatic analyses are ongoing utilizing DMRichR to identify individual genomic loci associated with ASD in each of the three generations and Comethyl to compare correlation patterns between methylation marks and selected variables including grand parental exposures. New born blood spot collections of parents and probands are ongoing and will be used to identify potential ASD epigenomic signatures that are tissue and life-stage independent.

Major features comprise kinetic tremor gait ataxia cognitive decline and cerebellar peduncular white matter lesions but atypicalincomplete FXTAS may occur. We explored the possibility of polygenic effects modifying the FXTAS spectrum phenotypes. We used three motor scales and selected cognitive tests in a series of three males and three females from a single sibship carrying PM or GZ alleles 44 to 75 repeats. The molecular profiles from these siblings were determined by genomewide association study with single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP genotyping by Illumina Global Screening Array. Nonparametric linkage analysis was applied and Parkinsons disease PD polygenic risk scores PRSs were calculated for all the siblings based on 107 known risk variants. All male and female siblings manifested similar kinetic tremor phenotypes. In contrast to FXTAS they showed negligible gait ataxia and few white matter lesions on MRI. Cognitive functioning was unaffected. Suggestive evidence of linkage to a broad region of the short arm of chromosome 10 was obtained and median PD PRS for the sibship fell within the top 30 of a sample of over 500000 UK and Australian controls. The genomewide study results are suggestive of modifying effects of genetic risk loci linked to PD on the neurological phenotype of FMR1-CGG small expansion carriers resulting in an oligosymptomatic kinetic tremor seen in FXTAS spectrum but also consistent with essential tremor.",

We conducted qualitative research to investigate what agency means to patients seeking contraceptive care to inform the development of a validated measure of this construct. METHODOLOGY We held four focus group discussions and seven interviews with sexually-active individuals assigned female at birth ages 16-29 years recruited from reproductive health clinics in Northern California. We explored experiences in contraceptive decision-making during the clinic visit. We coded data in ATLAS.ti and by hand compared codes across three coders and used thematic analysis to identify salient themes. RESULTS The sample mean age was 21 years with 17 of participants identifying as Asian 23 as Black 27 as Latinx 17 as Multiracialother and 27 as white. Overall participants reported active and engaged decision-making in their recent contraceptive visit but noted experiences that had undermined their agency in the past. They described how non-judgmental care allowed them to communicate openly affirming their ability to make their own decisions. However several mentioned how unexpected contraceptive side effects after the visit had reduced their sense of agency over their decision in retrospect. Several participants including those who identified as Black Latinx andor Asian described prior experiences where pressure to use a contraceptive method had undermined their agency and where they had switched providers to regain agency over their contraceptive decisions. DISCUSSION Most participants were aware of their agency during contraceptive visits and how it varied in different experiences with providers and the healthcare system. Patient perspectives can help to inform measurement development and ultimately the delivery of care that supports contraceptive agency.",

In addition natural compounds extracted from tissues of Kalancho have potential applicability in treating tumors and inflammatory and allergic diseases and have been shown to have insecticidal properties. Kalancho daigremontiana Hamet Perrier originated in Madagascar and reproduces asexually by spontaneously forming whole plantlets on leaves. Plantlets develop symmetrically along the leaf margins on leaf notches closely resembling zygotic embryos in development and once the root system is formed they detach from the mother-leaf fall to the ground and grow into new plants. This phenomenon is also found in other species from this same genus however the formation of leaf-plantlets is variable among species. Nevertheless all species illustrate the remarkable ability of plant somatic cells to regenerate an entire organism which has fascinated the scientific community for many years. It was only recently that the morphogenic process involved in the origin of K. daigremontiana plantlets was determined using molecular and genetic tools K. daigremontiana forms plantlets by co-opting both organogenesis and embryogenesis programs into leaves. The ability of K. daigremontiana species to form somatic embryos outside of a seed environment provides an attractive model system to study somatic embryogenesis in nature particularly the molecular mechanism involved in the acquisition of competence by vegetative cells to make embryos without fertilization.",

The initial study ADNI-1 enrolled 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment MCI 200 with early AD and 200 cognitively normal elderly controls. ADNI-1 was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and by a competitive renewal ADNI-2 which enrolled an additional 550 participants and will run until 2015. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results to the end of 2013. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows 1 the development of standardized methods for clinical tests magnetic resonance imaging MRI positron emission tomography PET and cerebrospinal fluid CSF biomarkers in a multicenter setting 2 elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects MCI patients and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are largely consistent with disease trajectories predicted by -amyloid cascade Hardy J Alzheimers Dis 20069Suppl 3151-3 and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity 3 the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently the best classifiers select and combine optimum features from multiple modalities including MRI 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET amyloid PET CSF biomarkers and clinical tests 4 the development of blood biomarkers for AD as potentially noninvasive and low-cost alternatives to CSF biomarkers for AD diagnosis and the assessment of -syn as an additional biomarker 5 the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers -amyloid 42 and tau as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages 6 the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Multimodal methods incorporating APOE status and longitudinal MRI proved most highly predictive of future decline. Refinements of clinical tests used as outcome measures such as clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes further reduced sample sizes 7 the pioneering of genome-wide association studies that leverage quantitative imaging and biomarker phenotypes including longitudinal data to confirm recently identified loci CR1 CLU and PICALM and to identify novel AD risk loci 8 worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Japan Australia Argentina Taiwan China Korea Europe and Italy 9 understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging MCI and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker and clinical data to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD and 10 the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world.",

To identify the competencies required of an effective teacher in medical education the authors developed a comprehensive conceptual model. After conducting a literature search the authors met at a two-day conference 2006 with 16 medical and nonmedical educators from 10 different U.S. and Canadian organizations and developed an initial draft of the Teaching as a Competency conceptual model. Conference participants used the physician competencies from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ACGME and the roles from the Royal Colleges Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists CanMEDS to define critical skills for medical educators. The authors then refined this initial framework through nationalregional conference presentations 2007 2008 an additional literature review and expert input. Four core values grounded this framework learner engagement learner-centeredness adaptability and self-reflection. The authors identified six core competencies based on the ACGME competencies framework medical or content knowledge learner- centeredness interpersonal and communication skills professionalism and role modeling practice-based reflection and systems-based practice. They also included four specialized competencies for educators with additional programmatic roles program designimplementation evaluationscholarship leadership and mentorship. The authors then cross-referenced the competencies with educator roles drawing from CanMEDS to recognize role-specific skills. The authors have explored their frameworks strengths limitations and applications which include targeted faculty development evaluation and resource allocation.

Patients age ranged from 1-31 years median 7 years. The duration from the time of surgical repair to TSP ranged from 0.1-21 years median 5 years. Indications for TSP included diagnostic and therapeutic intervention for pulmonary venous obstruction 12 creation of a baffle fenestration 2 prosthetic mitral valve evaluation 1 left ventricular outflow tract evaluation 1 access the left heart for hemodynamic evaluation 23. The IAP was traversed in 3839 patients 97.5 followed by diagnostic or therapeutic prograde left-heart catheterization. No complications were encountered. Follow up echocardiography in 3038 PTS demonstrated no residual shunting across the atrial septum except for two cases in which the atrial baffle had been intentionally fenestrated. Transseptal puncture through an intra-atrial patch is a safe procedure. This technique is effective in permitting diagnostic and therapeutic left heart catheterization and does not result in residual shunting through the patch.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND In 2012 nearly one-third of adults 65 years or older with Medicare discharged to home after hospitalization were referred for home health care HHC services. Care coordination between the hospital and HHC is frequently inadequate and may contribute to medication errors and readmissions. Insights from HHC nurses could inform improvements to care coordination. OBJECTIVE To describe HHC nurse perspectives about challenges and solutions to coordinating care for recently discharged patients. DESIGNPARTICIPANTS We conducted a descriptive qualitative study with six focus groups of HHC nurses and staff n 56 recruited from six agencies in Colorado. Focus groups were recorded transcribed and analyzed using a mixed deductiveinductive approach to theme analysis with a team-based iterative method. KEY RESULTS HHC nurses described challenges and solutions within domains of Accountability Communication Assessing Needs Goals and Medication Management. One additional domain of Safety for both patients and HHC nurses emerged from the analysis. Within each domain solutions for improving care coordination included the following 1 Accountability-hospital physicians willing to manage HHC orders until primary care follow-up potential legislation allowing physician assistants and nurse practitioners to write HHC orders 2 Communication-enhanced access to hospital records and direct telephone lines for HHC 3 Assessing Needs Goals-liaisons from HHC agencies meeting with patients in hospital 4 Medication Management-HHC coordinating directly with clinician or pharmacist to resolve discrepancies and 5 Safety-HHC nurses contributing non-reimbursable services for patients and ensuring that cognitive and behavioral health information is shared with HHC. CONCLUSIONS In an era of shared accountability for patient outcomes across settings solutions for improving care coordination with HHC are needed. Efforts to improve care coordination with HHC should focus on clearly defining accountability for orders enhanced communication improved alignment of expectations for HHC between clinicians and patients a focus on reducing medication discrepancies and prioritizing safety for both patients and HHC nurses.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE HIV and cardiometabolic disorders including hypertension and diabetes pose a serious double threat in Malawi. Supportive couple relationships may be an important resource for managing these conditions. According to the theory of communal coping couples will more effectively manage illness if they view the illness as our problem shared illness appraisal and are united in shared behavioral efforts. METHODS This study qualitatively investigated communal coping of 25 couples living with HIV and hypertension or diabetes in Zomba Malawi. Partners were interviewed separately regarding relationship quality shared illness appraisal communal coping and dyadic management of illness. RESULTS Most participants 80 were living with HIV and more than half were also living with hypertension. Most participants expressed high levels of unity and the view that illness was our problem. In some couples partners expected but did not extend help and support and reported little collaboration. Communal coping and dyadic management were strongly gendered. Some women reported a one-sided support relationship in which they gave but did not receive support. Women were also more likely to initiate support interactions and offered more varied support than men. In couples with poor relationship quality and weak communal coping dyadic management of illness was also weak. Partner support was particularly crucial for dietary changes as women typically prepared meals for the entire family. Other lifestyle changes that could be supported or hindered by a partner included exercise stress reduction and medication adherence. CONCLUSION We conclude that gendered power imbalances may influence the extent to which couple-level ideals translate into actual communal coping and health behaviors. Given that spouses and families of patients are also at risk due to shared environments we call for a shift from an illness management paradigm to a paradigm of optimizing health for spouses and families regardless of diabetes or hypertension diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Upwelling can impact water quality dynamics in stratified water bodies. Conceptual models generally classify the upwelling response to winds in lakes into either a non-rotational 2D closed-basin model or a rotational coastal upwelling counterpart. The non-rotational model is broadly applied in rotationally influenced lakes. The upwelling response to winds in stratified lakes may exhibit elements of both conceptual models. Here we present the results of simulations with an accurate three-dimensional numerical model of a lake of moderate size Lake Tahoe CaliforniaNevada USA and focus our analyses on addressing the influence of the Coriolis force during the upwelling setup and relaxation phases. Upwelling was observed at the upwind boundary as well as along the coast to the left of the mean wind direction due to Ekman-driven divergence. On the downwind shoreline where downwelling occurs alongshore currents appeared in response to wind forcing. Following the relaxation of the wind our simulations reveal for the first time the existence of powerful cyclonic alongshore currents in lakes of moderate size which are found to be in quasi-geostrophic balance. These currents followed the characteristics of coastal jets often observed in large lakes and the coastal ocean. Our work leads us to conclude that upwelling setup in lakes with length scales 20 km and Burger numbers S 1 exhibits a combination of dynamics predicted by both the non-rotational 2D closed basin model and the rotational coastal-upwelling conceptual model.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Despite the widespread implementation of electronic health records EHRs there is growing evidence that racialethnic minority patients do not use portals as frequently as non-Hispanic whites to access their EHR information online. This differential portal use could be problematic for health care disparities since early evidence links portal use to better outcomes. OBJECTIVE We sought to understand specific barriers to portal use among African American and Latino patients at Kaiser Permanente which has had a portal in place for over a decade and broad uptake among the patient population at large. METHODS We conducted 10 focus groups with 87 participants in 2012 and 2013 among African American and Latino Kaiser Permanente members in the mid-Atlantic Georgia and Southern California regions. Members were eligible to participate if they were not registered for portal access. Focus groups were conducted within each racialethnic group and each included individuals who were older had a chronic disease or were parents as these are the three biggest users of the portal at Kaiser Permanente overall. We videotaped each focus group and transcribed the discussion for analysis. We used general inductive coding to develop themes for major barriers to portal use overall and separately by racialethnic group. RESULTS We found that lack of support was a key barrier to initiating portal use in our sample-both in terms of technical assistance as well as the fear of the portal eroding existing personal relationships with health care providers. This held true across a range of focus groups representing a mix of age income health conditions and geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS Our study was among the first qualitative explorations of barriers to portal use among racialethnic subgroups. Our findings suggest that uniform adoption of portal use across diverse patient groups requires more usable and personalized websites which may be particularly important for reducing health care disparities. This work is particularly important as all health care systems continue to offer and promote more health care features online via portals.",

Previously X-ray diffraction from individual two-dimensional crystals did not represent a suitable investigational tool because of radiation damage. The recent availability of ultrashort pulses from X-ray free-electron lasers XFELs has now provided a means to outrun the damage. Here we report on measurements performed at the Linac Coherent Light Source XFEL on bacteriorhodopsin two-dimensional crystals mounted on a solid support and kept at room temperature. By merging data from about a dozen single crystal diffraction images we unambiguously identified the diffraction peaks to a resolution of 7 thus improving the observable resolution with respect to that achievable from a single pattern alone. This indicates that a larger dataset will allow for reliable quantification of peak intensities and in turn a corresponding increase in the resolution. The presented results pave the way for further XFEL studies on two-dimensional crystals which may include pump-probe experiments at subpicosecond time resolution.",

Infants viewed eight pairs of objects and their looking was recorded using their own webcam. Each pair contained one item with an easily graspable handle-like region and one without. Infants duration of looking at each item was coded from the recordings allowing us to evaluate their preference for the handled item. In addition parents reported on their infants motor behavior in the previous week. Overall infants looked longer to handled items than non-handled items. Additionally by examining the duration of infants individual looks we show that differences in infants interest in the handled items varied both by infants motor level and across the course of the 8-s trials. These findings confirm infant visual preferences can be successfully measured using Lookit and that motor development is related to infants visual preferences for items with a graspable handle-like region.

This qualitative grounded theory study is based on seven waves of interviews total 98 conducted over approximately five years with 15 Latina dementia kin carers recruited through clinic and community sites in Northern California. Findings show how Latina kin carers exercise a degree of control and autonomy over the care process because they have developed tacit knowledge and skills to craft quality care of kin. In facing the dilemma of ceding care to others they perceive as unprepared they reject available help.

      "abstract": "jatsp Solid-state magneto-ionic MI effects have shown promise for energy-efficient nanoelectronics where ionic migration may be used to achieve atomic-scale control of interfaces in magnetic nanostructures. To date magneto-ionics have been mostly explored in oxygen-based systems 1-4 while there is a surge of interest in alternative ionic systems due to their different ionic migration mechanisms and characteristics 5-7.jatsp jatspWe have recently demonstrated effective MI control of magnetic functionalities using a variety of ionic species particularly nitrogen. In nitride-based TaCoFeMnNTa films the chemically induced MI effect is combined with the electric field driving of nitrogen to electrically manipulate exchange bias 8. Upon field-cooling the heterostructure ionic diffusion of nitrogen from MnN into the Ta layers occurs. A significant exchange bias is observed which can be further enhanced by 20 after voltage conditioning Figs. 1a-1e. This enhancement can be reversed by voltage conditioning with an opposite polarity. Nitrogen migration within the MnN layer and into the Ta capping layer causes the enhancement in exchange bias which is observed in polarized neutron reflectometry studies.jatsp jatspWe have also achieved all-nitride-based magneto-ionic systems 9. Thin films of 001-ordered Mnjatssub4jatssubN are grown by sputtering Mn onto Mnjatssub3jatssubNjatssub2 jatssubseed layer on Si 100 substrate. Nitrogen ion migration across the Mnjatssub3jatssubNjatssub2 jatssubMn layers leads to a continuous evolution of the layers to Mnjatssub3jatssubNjatssub2 jatssubMnjatssub4jatssubN Mnjatssub2jatssubNMnjatssub4jatssubN and eventually Mnjatssub4jatssubN alone Figs. 1f-1g. Furthermore we have demonstrated MI control of the exchange bias effect in an all-nitride Mnjatssub4jatssubNMnNjatssubxjatssub system where the field-trained exchange field can be varied up to ten times by introducing or extracting nitrogen from the nitride system. This is achieved by adjusting the nitrogen gas partial pressure during deposition or varying annealing temperature after deposition.jatsp jatspThese effects demonstrate contrasts with oxygen-based MI effects in terms of operating principles switching speed and reversibility. Such MI systems are valuable platforms to gain quantitative understanding at buried interfaces. They also offer potentials for device applications based on electric modulation of magnetic functionalities.jatsp jatspThis work has been supported in part by the NSF ECCS-2151809 DMR-2005108 DMR-1828420 SRCNIST SMART Center and KAUST.jatsp jatsp1 U.

An important feature of the California trading system was its allowance pricecontainment policies intended to limit the range of allowance prices. The scope and ambition of the system had been expected to set an example for other states and countries about the efficacy and revenue potential of cap-and-trade systems. However despite achieving its emissions reductions targets at lower than expected costs the system has been considered a disappointment in the political arena. A major source of disillusionment with the California system has been its failure to generate the expected amount of revenues that would have contributed to a wide range of public expenditures. The design of the price-containment system while effective at maintaining a relatively high marginal carbon price contributes to the wide range of uncertainty over the revenue potential of allowance sales.",

We triangulate on these questions with multiple methods longitudinal experimental and field studies diverse population samples MBA students employees and professional repatriates and both laboratory and real-world measures. Using a longitudinal design over a 10-month MBA program Study 1 found that intercultural dating predicted improved creative performance on both divergent and convergent thinking tasks. Using an experimental design Study 2 established the causal connection between intercultural dating and creativity Among participants who had previously had both intercultural and intracultural dating experiences those who reflected on an intercultural dating experience displayed higher creativity compared to those who reflected on an intracultural dating experience. Importantly cultural learning mediated this effect. Extending the first 2 studies Study 3 revealed that the duration of past intercultural romantic relationships positively predicted the ability of current employees to generate creative names for marketing products but the number of past intercultural romantic partners did not. In Study 4 we analyzed an original dataset of 2226 professional repatriates from 96 countries who had previously worked in the U.S. under J-1 visas Participants frequency of contact with American friends since returning to their home countries positively predicted their workplace innovation and likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs. Going out with a close friend or romantic partner from a foreign culture can help people go out of the box and into a creative frame of mind. PsycINFO Database Record",

      "abstract": "Consuming too much fat sugar and salt is associated with adverse health outcomes. Food reformulation is one possible strategy to enhance the food environment by improving the nutritional quality of commercial products. However food reformulation faces many hindrances. One way to alleviate some of these hindrances is to embrace a multicriteria approach that is based on a market inventory. In this objective additional sensory screening and water content analyses allow going beyond nutrition and composition information on the packaging. However due to feasibility reasons for later in-depth analyses it is necessary to work with several reduced and manageable products. To the best of the authors knowledge in the literature there is no sample selection approach taking into account multiple criteria as a base for future food reformulation. The overall aim of this paper is to propose a method to select the best representative products from the market base for future reformulation by going beyond nutrition and composition information on the packaging. This approach considered therefore nutrition composition economic water content and sensory information with the example of the cookies market. The first step is the creation of an extensive cookie database including sensory and water content information. In total 178 cookies among the French market were identified then focus was placed on 62 chocolate chip cookies only. Sensory screening and water content analyses of all 62 products were conducted. The second step is to make an informed subset selection thanks to a cluster analysis based on 11 nutrition composition and water content variables. A representative subset of 18 cookies could be derived from the obtained clusters. The representativity was evaluated with statistical uni- and multivariate analyses. Results showed a broad variety of chocolate chips cookies with a large nutritional compositional water content and sensory differences. These results highlighted the first paths for future reformulation in this product category and showed the importance to include physical product information beyond the information on the packaging. This complete database on the selected cookies constituted a solid base for identifying future reformulation levers in order to improve the nutritional quality and health.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Explore how pediatric residents perceive the impact of a curriculum addressing racism on their knowledge motivation skills and behaviors and investigate the contextual factors that promote or impede the curriculums effectiveness. METHODS Open-ended semistructured interviews were conducted at 2 academic medical centers between August 2019 and 2020 among pediatric residents who participated in the curriculum. Interviews were recorded transcribed and analyzed by using inductive content analysis. RESULTS Pediatric residents n 16 were predominantly white 66.7 female 86.7 interns 60 from the Midwest 40. Six major themes emerged describing the perceived impact of the curriculum on knowledge - 1 Understanding of race and racism as structural forces in a historical context motivation - 2 Owning the issue of racism 3 Having the curriculum makes a statement skills - 4 Critical self-reflection 5 Perceived development of skills to mitigate biases and action-planning - 6 Turning insight into strategies to combat racism and improve patient care. Two additional themes emerged describing contextual factors that promoted or impeded the curriculum such as the content of the curriculum itself the racial demographics of the participants the implementation infrastructure and environmental factors such as the culture of the training program. CONCLUSIONS Medical education addressing racism can facilitate the perceived acquisition of foundational knowledge regarding race and racism motivation and skill-building to combat racism and action planning aimed at improving patient care. Contextual factors should be considered when developing and implementing such curricula to not only promote racial equity but avoid unintended harms.",

      "abstract": "Community Supported Agriculture CSA faces substantial challenges in increasingly saturated and competitive markets in which competitors highlight their localness. Retention of members is crucial for the model to provide benefits to farmers otherwise excessive losses of members requires considerable recruitment efforts and undercuts farmer well-being. We conducted statewide research on CSAs in California including surveys of 409 former members 1149 current members and 111 CSA farmers to examine former members reasons for leaving. We answer three questions How do former and current members differ in their satisfaction with CSA Why do former members leave their CSAs And does share customization increase retention rates Examining the datasets together shows what we call the CSA customization paradox while it appears that former members primary reasons for leaving could be addressed by offering them share customization the farm-level data shows that offering share customization has no effect on CSAs retention rates. The discussion offers three hypotheses to further examine the CSA customization paradox and argues for a deeper theorization of CSA people to understand the limitations of share customization as a strategy for member retention. We conclude with specific routes that CSAs can take individually and collectively to retain members and cultivate CSA people.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Endothelial dysfunction including upregulation of inflammatory adhesion molecules and impaired vasodilatation is a key element in cardiovascular disease. Aging and estrogen withdrawal in women are associated with endothelial inflammation vascular stiffness and increased cardiovascular disease. Epoxyecosatrienoic acids EETs the products of arachidonic acid metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 CYP 2J 2C and other isoforms are regulated by soluble epoxide hydrolase sEH-catalyzed conversion into less active diols. We hypothesized that 1112-EETs would reduce the endothelial dysfunction associated with aging and estrogen loss. APPROACHRESULTS When stabilized by an sEH inhibitor seHi 1112-EET at a physiologically low dose 0.1nM reduced cytokine-stimulated upregulation of adhesion molecules on human aorta endothelial cells HAEC and monocyte adhesion under shear flow through marked depolarization of the HAEC when combined with TNF. Mechanistically neither 1112-EETs nor 17-estradiol E2 at physiologic concentrations prevented activation of NFB by TNF. E2 at physiological concentrations reduced sEH expression in HAEC but did not alter CYP expression and when combined with TNF depolarized the cell. We also examined vascular dysfunction in adult and aged ovariectomized Norway brown rats with and without E2 replacement using an ex-vivo model to analyze endothelial function in an intact segment of artery. sEHi and 1112-EET with or without E2 attenuated phenylephrine induced constriction and increased endothelial-dependent dilation of aortic rings from ovariectomized rats. CONCLUSIONS Increasing 1112-EETs through sEH inhibition effectively attenuates inflammation and may provide an effective strategy to preserve endothelial function and prevent atherosclerotic heart disease in postmenopausal women.",

Advocacy groups and patients identify family planning clinics as the preferred sites to lead PrEP implementation for women in the United States. However limited qualitative exploration exists of U.S. family planning practitioners attitudes toward integrating PrEP into their work. METHODS We conducted qualitative focus groups with a convenience sample of family planning clinicians counselors and clinic managers to explore barriers and facilitators to PrEP provision in U.S. family planning clinics. RESULTS We conducted six focus groups total participants 37 with respondents who worked in family planning clinics in San Francisco California Kansas City Missouri and Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Key themes emerged highlighting how PrEP at times runs contrary to other family planning agendas including efficient clinic visits condom promotion and long-acting reversible contraception counseling. Throughout these discussions participants expressed discomfort with HIV vulnerabilities rooted in social and structural determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that those seeking to implement PrEP for U.S. cisgender women may benefit from exploring 1 how to integrate patientprovider conversations about the structural determinants of health and their relationship to HIV and other sexual and reproductive health outcomes and 2 how to foster person-centered prevention conversations in the context of busy family planning visits.",

Even though abundant SVs are an under-explored source of genetic variation mainly due to methodological limitations at their detection. RESULTS We employed a multiple platform approach to produce long-range genomic data for two different Nebbiolo clones namely optical mapping long-reads and linked-reads. We performed a haplotype-resolved de novo assembly for cultivar Nebbiolo clone CVT 71 and used an ab-initio strategy to annotate it. The annotated assembly enhanced our ability to detect SVs enabling the study of genomic regions not present in the grapevines reference genome and accounting for their functional implications. We performed variant calling analyses at three different organizational levels i between haplotypes of clone CVT 71 primary assembly vs haplotigs ii between Nebbiolo and Cabernet Sauvignon assemblies and iii between clones CVT 71 and CVT 185 representing different Nebbiolo biotypes. The cumulative size of non-redundant merged SVs indicated a total of 79.6 Mbp for the first comparison and 136.1 Mbp for the second one while no SVs were detected for the third comparison. Interestingly SVs differentiating cultivars and haplotypes affected similar numbers of coding genes. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that SVs accumulation rate and their functional implications in Nebbiolo genome are highly-dependent on the organizational level under study. SVs are abundant when comparing Nebbiolo to a different cultivar or the two haplotypes of the same individual while they turned absent between the two analysed clones.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Adequate water intake is associated with improved cognitive and physical performance prevention of dental caries and overweight and obesity. However access to free drinking water in schools remains inadequate. Water First a school-based intervention promoting water consumption was shown effective in preventing overweight yet its costs have not been quantified. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the costs of Water First from the schools perspective over 1 academic year. DESIGN Secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized clinical trial assessing the cost of Water First. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Six public schools in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 2018-2019 academic year with an average of 578 69 students per school and 110 2 fourth-grade students in intervention schools and 508 190 students per school and 101 5 fourth-grade students in control schools. INTERVENTION Schools were randomized to receive water dispensers and stations in cafeterias and high-traffic areas and a schoolwide water promotion campaign school-level intervention. Fourth-grade students and teachers received reusable water bottles lessons and materials for school and home class-level intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Activities resources and the value needed to implement the school-level and classroom-level intervention were systematically captured over 1 academic year including labor materials and utilities costs. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The intervention costs per school and per student were estimated by summing the component-specific costs. Results are presented for both school-level and classroom-level interventions in 2023 US dollars. RESULTS The Water First intervention costs 20 per student for the school-level and 131 per student for the classroom-level intervention over 1 academic year. Accounting for the useful life of the installed water stations and dispensers beyond 1 year the annualized cost of the school-level intervention was 11 per student. CONCLUSIONS These cost estimates provide useful insights for schools and stakeholders to plan and implement effective school-based interventions that promote access to drinking water.",

Multiple regression analysis confirmed symptomaticasymptomatic status as a significant determinant of ALOX15B mRNA levels independently of potentially confounding factors. Immunohistochemical analyses showed abundant ALOX15B expression in macrophage-rich areas of carotid lesions and lipidomic analyses demonstrated the presence of typical ALOX15B products in plaque tissue. In summary we observed associations between high ALOX15B expression in carotid lesions and a history of cerebrovascular symptoms. These findings suggest a link between ALOX15B and atherothrombotic events that merits further investigation.",

The potential associations between Zika and fetal neurological disorders were reported extensively in the media regarding neighboring Brazil and led to great concern about the impact Zika could have on peoples health in Iquitos when it arrived. The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge attitudes and preventative practices related to Zika virus and its transmission among women of childbearing age in Iquitos Peru. Six focus group discussions with 46 women of ages 20-35 from an Iquitos district with confirmed Zika cases were conducted to explore 1 knowledge of Zika transmission its symptoms and treatment 2 attitudes regarding Zika including perceptions of risk for and severity of Zika and 3 preventative practices including awareness of health promotion activities. Participants were knowledgeable about Zika symptoms and knew it was transmitted by mosquitoes and about half had heard about the association between Zika and microcephaly but most lacked knowledge about the associated neurological disorders in adults its sexual transmission and ways to prevent infection. They expressed concern for pregnant women exposed to the virus and the impact on the fetus. Participants felt at risk of contracting the Zika virus yet had not changed preventive practices possibly in part because their perception of the severity of this disease was low. This study reveals knowledge gaps that could be addressed via health promotion messages that might improve prevention practices to help community members protect themselves from Zika virus during this outbreak.",

      "abstract": "Historically many diseases have been named after the species or location of discovery the discovering scientists or the most impacted population. However species-specific disease names often misrepresent the true reservoir location-based disease names are frequently targeted with xenophobia some of the discovering scientists have darker histories and impacted populations have been stigmatized for this association. Acknowledging these concerns the World Health Organization now proposes naming diseases after their causative pathogen or symptomatology. Recently this guidance has been retrospectively applied to a disease at the center of an outbreak rife with stigmatization and misinformation mpox f.k.a. monkeypox. This disease historically endemic to west and central Africa has prompted racist remarks as it spread globally in 2022 in an epidemic ongoing today. Moreover its elevated prevalence among men who have sex with men has yielded increased stigma against the LGBTQ community. To address these prejudicial associations monkeypox was renamed mpox in November 2022. We used publicly available data from Google Search Trends to determine which countries were quicker to adopt this name change-and understand factors that limit or facilitate its use. Specifically we built regression models to quantify the relationship between mpox search intensity in a given country and the countrys type of political regime robustness of sociopolitical and health systems level of pandemic preparedness extent of gender and educational inequalities and temporal evolution of mpox cases through December 2023. Our results suggest that when compared to monkeypox search intensity mpox search intensity was significantly higher in countries with any history of mpox outbreaks or higher levels of LGBTQ acceptance meanwhile mpox search intensity was significantly lower in countries governed by leaders who had recently propagated infectious disease misinformation. Among infectious diseases with stigmatizing names mpox is among the first to be revised retrospectively. While the adoption of a given disease name will be context-specific-depending in part on its origins and the affected subpopulations-our study provides generalizable insights applicable to future changes in disease nomenclature.",

      "abstract": "We recently reported sex differences in mesenteric arterial function of the UC Davis type-2 diabetes mellitus UCD-T2DM rats as early as the prediabetic state. We reported that mesenteric arteries MA from prediabetic male rats exhibited a greater impairment compared to that in prediabetic females. However when females became diabetic they exhibited a greater vascular dysfunction than males. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate whether the female sex hormone estrogen preserves mesenteric arterial vasorelaxation in UCD-T2DM female rats at an early prediabetic state. Age-matched female Sprague Dawley and prediabetic PD UCD-T2DM rats were ovariectomized OVX and subcutaneously implanted with either placebo or 17-estradiol E2 1.5 mg pellets for 45 days. We assessed the contribution of endothelium-derived relaxing factors EDRF to acetylcholine ACh-induced vasorelaxation using pharmacological inhibitors. Responses to sodium nitroprusside SNP and phenylephrine PE were also measured. Additionally metabolic parameters and expression of some targets associated with vascular and insulin signaling were determined. We demonstrated that the responses to ACh and SNP were severely impaired in the prediabetic state PD OVX rats while E2 treatment restored vasorelaxation in the PD OVX E2. Moreover the responses to PE was significantly enhanced in MA of PD OVX groups regardless of placebo or E2 treatment. Overall our data suggest that 1 the impairment of ACh responses in PD OVX rats may in part result from the elevated contractile responses to PE loss of contribution of endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization EDH to vasorelaxation and a decreased sensitivity of MA to nitric oxide NO and 2 the basis for the protective effects of E2 may be partly attributed to the elevation of the NO contribution to vasorelaxation and its interaction with MA as well as potential improvement of insulin signaling. Here we provide the first evidence of the role of E2 in protecting MA from early vascular dysfunction in prediabetic female rats.",

      "abstract": "Low residential energy use is typically associated with undesirable characteristics such as poverty thermal discomfort or small dwelling size. The association of low energy use with deprivation has been an obstacle to promoting more aggressive goals for reduction of residential use. However there is little research on the composition of the low user population. We investigated the demographics behavior and satisfaction of the lowest 10 of electricity consumers in Sacramento CA to see what attributes best correlated with low use. California like many other regions has GHG emissions goals requiring drastic reductions in residential consumption. Households in Sacramentos lowest decile of electricity consumption already live at electricity consumption levels consistent with the goals for 2050. Our investigation of 700 of these households found that diversity of low users with regard to age income education appliance ownership and dwelling characteristics is similar to that of the general population. Low-use households tend to be smaller but not enough to explain the entirety of low usage. Surveys and interviews revealed that those in the lowest 10 typically pursued low consumption deliberately and enthusiastically and were aware of their status as low users. Conversations about energy conserving strategies were embedded in their social lives. They employed diverse and creative strategies to maintain thermal comfort without excess energy use often exceeding expert recommendations. Finally the distribution of self-reported quality of life was no different from that of the general population living at much higher consumption levels. Overall the key determinants of low use were a positive engagement with improvisation and experimentation and the salience of energy in personal or social life. The population of low users should be treated as a valuable source of peer advice and lifestyle modeling.",

      "abstract": "Cape Espenberg is on the farthest southwestern extent of Kotzebue Sound Alaska just above the Arctic Circle and is a peninsula composed of a series of dune-covered beach ridges. As part of a larger research initiative extensive mapping to record all cultural features and characterize the topography of approximately 1 km2 on the southeastern terminus of the cape was undertaken in 2007 and 2010. The primary purpose of this mapping was to explore the use of the cape for the past 1200 years using one of the unique aspects of beach-ridge archaeology horizontal stratigraphy. There were 11 intervals of beach ridgedune development and with the exception of one truncated ridge and the modern ridge Thule-lhupiaq people built semi-subterranean winter houses on each ridge. A total of 117 house depressions along with related cache pits artifact scatters whale bone and hearths were identified distribution of house forms indicate that Cape Espenberg has had an unbroken stream of cultural continuity. However in terms of house architecture and community patterning it appears that there has been a reduction of certain architectural components over time. Houses also occur more frequently in isolated contexts. Both aspects are coincident with the onset of the Little Ice Age. Copyright 2013 by the Society for American Archaeology.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Though research has established that firearms in the home increase risk for injury and death a substantial number of Americans especially gun owners believe that guns make their homes safer. More than half of gun owners in a nationally-representative survey said it depends when asked whether guns make their homes safer or more dangerous but little is known about the factors that affect perceived safety. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the relationship between the presence of firearms and perceived home or neighborhood safety is fixed or depends on additional factors and to identify the additional factors on which it depends. METHODS A mixed-methods cross-sectional analysis of the 2018 state-representative California Safety and Wellbeing Survey n 2558 completion rate 49 including calculation of weighted proportions and qualitative analysis of write-in responses. FINDINGS One in six respondents 17.2 95 CI 14.9 to 19.7 reported it depends when asked whether a gun in their home made the home a safer or more dangerous place to be the home scenario. One in six 16.6 95 CI 14.3 to 19.2 reported it depends when asked whether the neighborhood would be safer if all neighbors had guns in the home the neighborhood scenario. For the home scenario 28.3 95 CI 21.9 to 35.7 cited firearm owner characteristics e.g. training and proficiency temperament and mental health 28.4 95 CI 22.3 to 35.5 cited firearm storage and access and 28.0 95 CI 21.5 to 35.7 cited intended use for guns as factors affecting perceived safety. For the neighborhood scenario respondents overwhelmingly cited gun owner characteristics 72.1 95 CI 63.4 to 79.3. Factors on which it depends varied by gun ownership status. CONCLUSION Perceived safety when firearms are in the home depends on numerous factors. Understanding these factors may inform tailored targeted messaging and interventions for firearm injury prevention.",

However paleoseismic data on the Altyn Tagh fault ATF one of the longest strike-slip fault in Asia are scarce. We document a long paleoseismic record along the Xorkoli section of the central ATF. Eight and probably nine earthquakes are identified based on event evidence in the form of open fissures folds unconformities and upward fault terminations with modeled mean 95 confidence ages of A.D. 1598 14911741 yr event A A.D. 797 676926 yr B B.C. 668 732589 yr C B.C. 956 1206715 yr D B.C. 1301 13691235 yr E B.C. 2105 22331987 yr F probable B.C. 2663 27312601 yr G B.C. 2818 28782742 yr H B.C. 3396 35223205 yr I. The mean recurrence interval is 620 410 yr with a coefficient of variation COV of 0.67 indicating that earthquake recurrence is weakly periodic with individual intervals ranging from as short as 150 yr to as long as 1460 yr. A global compilation of 35 strike-slip paleoseismic sites yields a similar average COV of 0.69. Synthesis of paleoseismic sites from the central ATF indicates that not all earthquakes ruptured to the eastern end of the Xorkoli section within the Aksay restraining bend. Given that the 420-yr elapsed time since the most recent event well within a COV of mean interval a large surface-rupturing earthquake could occur at any time along the central ATF.",

      "abstract": "The forced transfer of children from one group to another is considered an element of the crime of genocide yet this subject has attracted little scholarly attention. Using the history of the mass transfer of Armenian children during the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1922 as a case this article argues that the study of child transfer and recovery is critical to both the history of human rights and a more sophisticated understanding of genocide including the forms of genocide accompanying the colonial encounter. The experience of transferred children and their recovery or loss can help better clarify the historical relationship between the concepts of the rights of the child and individual human and minority rights as these have evolved before and immediately after World War II. Moreover this article also contends that it is important to characterize child transfer as genocide as opposed to colonial assimilation or acculturation as a feature of modernization when explaining the broader social impact of mass violence forced migration and cultural destruction on victimsurvivor and perpetrator communities. 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group LLC.",

Inequities in both access and outcomes are even more pronounced for socially disadvantaged older adults. The collaborative care model CCM has potential to reduce this burden through community-based organizations CBOs who serve these populations. However CCM has been understudied in diverse cultural and resource-constrained contexts. We evaluated the implementation and effectiveness of PEARLS a home-based CCM adapted with and for community health workerspromotores CHWsPs. METHODS We used an instrumental case study design. Our case definition is a community-academic partnership to build CHWP capacity for evidence-based depression care for older U.S. Latino adults in the Inland Empire region of California 2017-2020. We aimed to understand adaptations to fit local context acceptability feasibility and fidelity clinical effectiveness and contextual determinants of implementation success or failure. Data sources included quantitative and qualitative administrative and evaluation data from participants and providers. We used descriptive statistics and paired t-tests to characterize care delivery and evaluate effectiveness post-intervention and deductive thematic analysis to answer other aims. FINDINGS This case study included 152 PEARLS participants and nine data sources N 67 documents. The CBO including their CHWsPs partnered with the external implementation team made adaptations to PEARLS content context and implementation strategies to support CHWsPs and older adults. PEARLS was acceptable feasible and delivered with fidelity. Participants showed significant reductions in depression severity at 5 months 98 clinical response rate mean SD 13.7 3.9 drop in prepost PHQ-9 p 0.001 and received support for 2.6 social needs on average. PEARLS delivery was facilitated by its relative advantage adaptability and trialability the teams collective efficacy buy-in alignment with organization mission and ongoing reflection and evaluation during implementation. Delivery was challenged by weak partnerships with clinics for participant referral engagement reimbursement and sustainability post-grant funding. DISCUSSION This case study used existing data to learn how home-based CCM was adapted by and for CHWsPs to reduce health inequities in late-life depression and depression care among older Latino immigrants. The CBOs and CHWsPs strong trust and rapport addressing social and health needs alongside depression care and regular internal and external coaching and consultation appeared to drive successful implementation and effectiveness.",

We present a multi-level manual and computer-aided analysis of 98363 tweets posted by eleven political parties during the two-month run up to the elections to present the topical functional and interaction strategies of their Twitter campaigns. This analysis is complemented by a macro analysis of electoral outcomes relationship with first-time voter population and internet accessibility information at the state level. Our findings suggest that the new-and-upcoming parties used Twitter for self-promotion and media validation while established parties used it to supplement their offline strategies. It is also observed that the winning partys electoral success is significantly associated with their use of Twitter for engaging voters the large population of first-time voters and levels of internet accessibility.
