      "abstract": "AbstractThe influence of climate on deep-time plant-insect interactions is becoming increasingly well known, with temperature, CO2 increases (and associated stoichiometric changes in plants), and aridity likely playing a critical role. In our modern climate, all three factors are shifting at an unprecedented rate, with uncertain consequences for biodiversity. To investigate effects of temperature, stoichiometry (specifically that of nitrogen), and aridity on insect herbivory, we explored insect herbivory in three modern floral assemblages and in 39 fossil floras, especially focusing on eight floras around a past hyperthermal event (the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) from Bighorn Basin (BB). We find that higher temperatures were associated with increased herbivory in the past, especially among BB sites. In these BB sites, non-N2-fixing plants experienced a lower richness but higher frequency of herbivory damage than N2-fixing plants. Herbivory frequency but not richness was greater in BB sites compared with contemporaneous, nearby, but less arid sites from Hanna Basin. Compared with deep-time environments, herbivory frequency and richness are higher in modern sites, suggesting that current accelerated warming uniquely impacts plant-insect interactions. Overall, our work addresses multiple aspects of climate change using fossil data while also contextualizing the impact of modern anthropogenic change on Earth's most diverse interactions.",

      "abstract": "Coastal wetland ecosystems support unique biodiversity and are imminently threatened by climate change-driven sea level rise. However, the impact of climate change on their demographic and evolutionary histories is poorly understood. To improve our understanding, we examined how past climatic events have shaped the evolutionary history of the salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris), an endangered species and a salt marsh habitat specialist, completely restricted to coastal wetlands in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). We used whole mitochondrial genome sequences of 102 salt marsh harvest mice to characterize phylogeography and demographic history. Then, we predicted the ancient distribution of salt marsh habitat and examined correspondence between divergence, demographic history, and changes in ancient marsh habitat caused by sea level rise. A Bayesian Skyline Plot revealed demographic expansions during periods of sea level rise, particularly during the formation of the modern SFE (~ 10 kya), and rapid decline consistent with recent anthropogenic landscape change. Bayesian estimates of divergence time were consistent with subspecies divergence ~ 10 kya, and subpopulation divergence ~ 5 kya, consistent with multiple episodes of vicariance caused by Holocene sea level rise. Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variance and ΦST revealed a mismatch between the morphological and molecular subspecies assignment of two populations. Our study implicates sea level rise as a force of demographic change and evolutionary divergence in coastal marsh ecosystems. Our study also aids conservation of an endangered species by clarifying genetic subspecies boundaries and highlighting the unique nature of isolated populations that are increasingly threatened by modern sea level rise.",

      "abstract": "Assessing habitat quality is a major goal of conservationists and restoration practitioners, but to associate habitat quality with biomarkers of vagile animals, the biomarkers must respond rapidly. Here, we identified a biomarker capable of rapidly detecting food limitation in the imperiled Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a pelagic fish endemic to the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). We conducted an experiment with fed and unfed treatments of hatchery-raised, sub-adult Delta Smelt that were sampled at 12 time points: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 21 days. We then compared four biomarkers using Day 21 fish: RNA/DNA in liver, triglycerides in liver, glycogen in liver, and glycogen in muscle. Of the liver endpoints, glycogen had the largest difference between treatments at Day 21, so we compared it to muscle glycogen across all time points. Liver glycogen declined by 60% after 1 day of fasting and remained depressed in the fasting treatment across all subsequent time points. Muscle glycogen also responded rapidly, taking only 2 days to decline by 39% in the fasting treatment, but the difference was inconsistent across subsequent time points. When applied to hatchery-released Delta Smelt collected from the SFE, liver glycogen concentrations were less than half that of the fed hatchery fish, consistent with the hypothesis of food limitation in the wild, but also several other potential causes. This study highlights the utility of liver glycogen as an indicator of recent foraging success in Delta Smelt.",

      "abstract": "Health and nutrition of individuals are tied to reproductive success, which determines population viability. Environmental variability and anthropogenic effects can affect the health and nutrition of a species leading to reproductive repercussions which can hinder recovery of endangered populations. Indices of health and nutrition were examined for an imperiled species, delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus, in relation to their reproductive status to evaluate the effects of hydrologic conditions in the San Francisco Estuary and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Adult delta smelt were collected by the Fall Midwater Trawl and Spring Kodiak Trawl during monthly monitoring surveys run by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife from 2011 to 2018 spanning from the head of the Carquinez strait to the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. The hydrologic conditions during this period ranged from high precipitation (2011 and 2017) to drought (2012-2016). Drought, via indirect effects from contaminant concentrations and food availability, is hypothesized to influence the health and reproductive success of delta smelt. Each individual was examined for size (length, weight, and condition factor), health (gill and liver pathology/indices), nutritional (RNA/DNA and liver glycogen depletion estimated histologically), and reproductive indicators (gonadosomatic indices [GSI], oocyte developmental stage, clutch size, oocyte size, and oocyte weight). Fork length and condition factor both had strong, positive correlations with reproduction. Glycogen depletion was correlated with higher oocyte mass, oocyte area and GSI, indicating females low in liver glycogen had higher reproductive metrics. Gill and liver lesion severity, which often increases with contaminant exposure, were negatively associated with oocyte area and GSI. Delta smelt in Suisun Marsh and Cache Slough had the longest fork length and highest condition factor measures. Delta smelt in Cache Slough had the highest reproductive metrics and proportion of post-spawned females and late-stage oocytes. Drought did not appear to influence reproduction but reduced population size.",

      "abstract": "The Delta Smelt is a largely zooplanktivorous, endangered fish endemic to the San Francisco Estuary (the estuary). High flows increase the availability of fresh and brackish water habitat for Delta Smelt, but also may mobilize contaminants, potentially increasing toxicological stress. Here, we examine the association between contaminants and Delta Smelt health across contrasting water year types and flow-related management actions. Our study spanned the fall season of three years: 1 dry year (2018) bracketed by 2 wet years (2017 and 2019) and coincided with several management actions meant to benefit Delta Smelt. We collected field water from six sites in the estuary that encompass the freshwater and low-salinity habitat of Delta Smelt and analyzed the water for contaminant concentrations. After a 96-hour exposure to the field water, we assessed cultured Delta Smelt survival and the histopathological condition of the gill and liver. Insecticides, particularly fipronil metabolites, were the most prevalent contaminants detected in 2017 and 2018, and a variety of contaminants associated with the rice harvest were detected in 2019. No acute toxicity was observed during any exposure, but we observed negative effects in the livers of Delta Smelt exposed to agricultural water from the Toe Drain and Cache Slough during a 2019 pulse flow action, which coincided with elevated detections and concentrations of organic pesticides. Other noteworthy sub-lethal effects, likely occurring in response to contaminant mixtures, included severe gill lesions in Delta Smelt exposed to Decker Island water in 2019. In the drier year of 2018, lesions were generally mild or absent. Thus, the trade-offs between increased habitat availability and contaminant loading may provide one explanation for why Delta Smelt abundance does not consistently respond positively to outflow.",

      "abstract": "The widespread contamination of aquatic environments by microplastics (MPs), alongside other pollutants, has emerged as a critical global concern, posing significant risks to fish populations. This study investigated the impacts of microplastic ingestion on the phenotypic traits, survival rates, and antioxidant activities of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Three experimental groups were established: (T1) a control group fed a standard commercial diet (4% of body weight) twice daily, (T2) a group fed a mixed diet of 2% commercial pellets and 2% MPs twice daily, and (T3) a group fed 4% commercial pellets on the first day, no feed on the second day, and 4% MPs added directly to the water on the third day. Results demonstrated that tilapia exposed to MPs exhibited significantly lower survival rates, decreased body weight, reduced standard length, smaller eye diameters, and diminished body areas compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MP-exposed fish displayed elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reduced catalase activity, indicating altered antioxidant defense mechanisms. Proximate analysis revealed no significant differences in crude protein, moisture, and lipid content among the groups (P > 0.05), except for ash content, which was significantly higher in MP-exposed fish (P < 0.01). Geometric morphometric analysis did not reveal significant shape variations among the groups (P > 0.05), although the control group exhibited a significantly larger centroid size (an indicator of overall body size) than the MP-exposed groups (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that microplastic ingestion can have detrimental effects on the survival, growth, antioxidant status, and body composition of juvenile tilapia. This study underscores the critical need to consider the potential impacts of microplastic pollution on tilapia farming practices in the open water system.",

Here we investigated these questions by identifying microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (miR-QTLs), or genetic variants associated with brain miRNA levels, using genome-wide small RNA sequencing profiles from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of 604 older adult donors of European ancestry. Here we show that nearly half (224 of 470) of the analyzed miRNAs have associated miR-QTLs, many of which fall in regulatory regions such as brain promoters and enhancers. We also demonstrate that intragenic miRNAs often have genetic regulation independent from their host genes. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with 16 genome-wide association studies of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, we identified miRNAs that likely contribute to bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. These findings advance understanding of the genetic regulation of miRNAs and their role in brain health and disease.",

The topics addressed in this guideline are (a) Do biomarkers or rapid pathogen tests improve antibiotic prescribing and/or clinical outcomes? (b) Does taking blood cultures in common infectious syndromes improve antibiotic prescribing and/or clinical outcomes? (c) Does watchful waiting without antibacterial therapy or with delayed antibiotic prescribing reduce antibiotic prescribing without worsening clinical outcomes in patients with specific infectious syndromes? (d) Do structured culture follow-up programs in patients discharged from the ED with cultures pending improve antibiotic prescribing? METHODS: An expert panel was convened by European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and the guideline chair. The panel selected in consensus the four most relevant antimicrobial stewardship topics according to pre-defined relevance criteria. For each main question for the four topics, a systematic review was performed, including randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Both clinical outcomes and stewardship process outcomes related to antibiotic use were deemed relevant. The literature searches were conducted between May 2021 and March 2022. In April 2022, the panel members were formally asked to suggest additional studies that were not identified in the initial searches. Data were summarized in a meta-analysis if possible or otherwise summarized narratively. The certainty of the evidence was classified according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. The guideline panel reviewed the evidence per topic critically appraising the evidence and formulated recommendations through a consensus-based process. The strength of the recommendations was classified as strong or weak. To substantiate the implementation process, implementation trials or observational studies describing facilitators/barriers for implementation were identified from the same searches and were summarized narratively. RECOMMENDATIONS: The recommendations on the use of biomarkers and rapid pathogen diagnostic tests focus on the initiation of antibiotics in patients admitted through the ED. Their effect on the discontinuation or de-escalation of antibiotics during hospital stay was not reported, neither was their effect on hospital infection prevention and control practices. The recommendations on watchful waiting (i.e. withholding antibiotics with some form of follow-up) focus on specific infectious syndromes for which the primary care literature was also included. The recommendations on blood cultures focus on the indication in three common infectious syndromes in the ED explicitly excluding patients with sepsis or septic shock. Most recommendations are based on very low and low certainty of evidence, leading to weak recommendations or, when no evidence was available, to best practice statements. Implementation of these recommendations needs to be adapted to the specific settings and circumstances of the ED. The scarcity of high-quality studies in the area of antimicrobial stewardship in the ED highlights the need for future research in this field.",

Scatterhoarder-plant interactions are a prime example of this phenomenon, as scatterhoarders can either increase or reduce plant recruitment depending on the balance between seed dispersal and predation. We explored factors that drive the magnitude of net benefits for plants in this interaction using a mathematical model, with parameter values based on European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis). We measured benefits as the percentage of germinating seeds, and examined how varying rodent survival (reflecting, e.g. changes in predation pressure), the rate of seed loss to other granivores, the abundance of alternative food resources, and changes in masting patterns affect the quality of mutualism. We found that increasing granivore abundance can degrade the quality of plant-scatterhoarder mutualism due to increased cache pilferage. Scatterhoarders are predicted to respond by increasing immediate consumption of gathered seeds, leading to higher costs and reduced benefits for plants. Thus, biotic changes that are detrimental to rodent populations can be beneficial for tree recruitment due to adaptive behavior of rodents. When scatterhoarder populations decline too drastically (< 5 individuals ha-1 ); however, tree recruitment may also suffer.",

In vitro studies suggested that the loss of intestinal ATP7B affects metabolic dysregulation in WD. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the gut microbiota and lipidome in 2 mouse models of WD and by characterizing a new mouse model with a targeted deletion of Atp7b in the intestine. METHODS: Cecal content 16S sequencing and untargeted hepatic and plasma lipidome analyses in the Jackson Laboratory toxic-milk and the Atp7b null global knockout mouse models of WD were profiled and integrated. Intestine-specific Atp7b knockout mice (Atp7bΔIEC) were generated and characterized using targeted lipidome analysis following a high-fat diet challenge. RESULTS: Gut microbiota diversity was reduced in animal models of WD. Comparative prediction analysis revealed amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism functions to be dysregulated in the WD gut microbial metagenome. Liver and plasma lipidomic profiles showed dysregulated triglyceride and diglyceride, phospholipid, and sphingolipid metabolism in WD models. However, Atp7bΔIEC mice did not show gut microbiome differences compared to wild type. When challenged with a high-fat diet, Atp7bΔIEC mice exhibited profound alterations to fatty acid desaturation and sphingolipid metabolism pathways as well as altered APOB48 distribution in intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiome and lipidome underlie systemic metabolic manifestations in murine WD. Intestine-specific ATP7B deficiency affected both intestinal and systemic response to a high-fat challenge but not the microbiome profile, at least at early stages. WD is a systemic disease in which intestinal-specific ATP7B loss and diet influence the phenotype and the lipidome profile.",

Exposure to extreme heat is associated with numerous adverse human health outcomes. This study estimated the burden of heat-related illness (HRI) attributable to anthropogenic climate change in North Carolina physiographic divisions (Coastal and Piedmont) during the summer months from 2011 to 2016. Additionally, assuming intermediate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, future HRI morbidity burden attributable to climate change was estimated. The association between daily maximum temperature and the rate of HRI was evaluated using the Generalized Additive Model. The rate of HRI assuming natural simulations (i.e., absence of greenhouse gas emissions) and future greenhouse gas emission scenarios were predicted to estimate the HRI attributable to climate change. Over 4 years (2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015), we observed a significant decrease in the rate of HRI assuming natural simulations compared to the observed. About 3 out of 20 HRI visits are attributable to anthropogenic climate change in Coastal (13.40% [IQR: -34.90,95.52]) and Piedmont (16.39% [IQR: -35.18,148.26]) regions. During the future periods, the median rate of HRI was significantly higher (78.65%: Coastal and 65.85%: Piedmont), assuming a higher emission scenario than the intermediate emission scenario. We observed significant associations between anthropogenic climate change and adverse human health outcomes. Our findings indicate the need for evidence-based public health interventions to protect human health from climate-related exposures, like extreme heat, while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to extreme heat is a known risk factor that is associated with increased heat-related illness (HRI) outcomes. The relevance of heat wave definitions (HWDs) could change across health conditions and geographies due to the heterogenous climate profile. This study compared the sensitivity of 28 HWDs associated with HRI emergency department visits over five summer seasons (2011−2016), stratified by two physiographic regions (Coastal and Piedmont) in North Carolina. The HRI rate ratios associated with heat waves were estimated using the generalized linear regression framework assuming a negative binomial distribution. We compared the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values across the HWDs to identify an optimal HWD. In the Coastal region, HWDs based on daily maximum temperature with a threshold > 90th percentile for two or more consecutive days had the optimal model fit. In the Piedmont region, HWD based on the daily minimum temperature with a threshold value > 90th percentile for two or more consecutive days was optimal. The HWDs with optimal model performance included in this study captured moderate and frequent heat episodes compared to the National Weather Service (NWS) heat products. This study compared the HRI morbidity risk associated with epidemiologic-based HWDs and with NWS heat products. Our findings could be used for public health education and suggest recalibrating NWS heat products.",

In this paper, we report the assembly of the nuclear genome of Calasterella californica.

C. californica is only the sixth species of liverworts - a group with more than 7200 described species - to have a nuclear reference genome. The availability of this reference genome will facilitate the study of the unique features of C. californica and other liverworts, pave the road towards a comparative understanding of liverwort genomes, and add an important starting point for studies of the geographic variation of this species within the CCGP project.",

We previously developed a new concept termed \"Aberrant Cell Cycle Diseases\" (ACCD), revealing that these two diseases share a common mechanism of aberrant cell cycle re-entry. The aberrant cell cycle re-entry is manifested as kinase/oncogene activation and tumor suppressor inactivation, which are hallmarks of both tumor growth in cancers and neuronal death in neurological disorders. Therefore, some cancer therapies (e.g., kinase inhibition, tumor suppressor elevation) can be leveraged for neurological treatments. The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has so far approved 74 kinase inhibitors, with numerous other kinase inhibitors in clinical trials, mostly for the treatment of cancers. In contrast, there are dire unmet needs of FDA-approved drugs for neurological treatments, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke (IS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and others. In this review, we list these 74 FDA-approved kinase-targeted drugs and identify those that have been reported in preclinical and/or clinical trials for neurological disorders, with a purpose of discussing the feasibility and applicability of leveraging these cancer drugs (FDA-approved kinase inhibitors) for neurological treatments.",

However, little is known about the association between allostatic load and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. This study used a large prospective cohort in the United States to examine the relationship between allostatic load and invasive breast cancer risk, and to evaluate the relationship by racial and ethnic identity and breast cancer subtypes. METHODS: Among 161,808 postmenopausal participants in Women's Health Initiative, eligible were a subsample of 27,393 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years old, who enrolled from 1993 to 1998, had serum test biomarkers, and were followed for breast cancer incidence through February 2022. Allostatic load at enrollment was computed based on eight biomarkers from lab serum tests and a questionnaire about participants' prescription drug use. The associations between allostatic scores and risk of breast cancer (overall and by subtypes) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. The race and ethnic differences were examined. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up time of 17.24 years, 1722 invasive breast cancer cases were identified. High allostatic load was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (HR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.20, 1.54 for third tertile vs first tertile, Ptrend < 0.0001). Similar trends were found in White women and non-Hispanic women. Higher allostatic load was associated with hormone receptor-positive and HER2/Neu-negative breast cancer (HR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.30, 1.80 for third tertile vs first tertile, Ptrend < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that higher allostatic load was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), an immune mediated disease characterized by repeated episodes of intra-ocular inflammation, affects 25% of horses in the USA and is the most common cause of glaucoma, cataracts, and blindness. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have immunomodulatory properties, which are upregulated by preconditioning with toll-like receptor agonists. The objective was to evaluate safety and migration of TLR-3 agonist polyinosinic, polycytidylic acid (pIC)-activated MSCs injected subconjunctivally in healthy horses prior to clinical application in horses with ERU. We hypothesized that activated allogeneic MSCs injected subconjunctivally would not induce ocular or systemic inflammation and would remain in the conjunctiva for >14 days. METHODS: Bulbar subconjunctiva of two horses was injected with 10 × 106 pIC-activated (10 μg/mL, 2 h) GFP-labeled MSCs from one donor three times at two-week intervals. Vehicle (saline) control was injected in the contralateral conjunctiva. Horses received physical and ophthalmic exams [slit lamp biomicroscopy, rebound tonometry, fundic examination, and semiquantitative preclinical ocular toxicology scoring (SPOTS)] every 1-3 days. Systemic inflammation was assessed via CBC, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A (SAA). Horses were euthanized 14 days following final injection. Full necropsy and histopathology were performed to examine ocular tissues and 36 systemic organs for MSC presence via IVIS Spectrum. Anti-GFP immunohistochemistry was performed on ocular tissues. RESULTS: No change in physical examinations was noted. Bloodwork revealed fibrinogen 100-300 mg/dL (ref 100-400) and SAA 0-25 μg/mL (ref 0-20). Ocular effects of the subjconjucntival injection were similar between MSC and control eyes on SPOTS grading system, with conjunctival hypermia, chemosis and ocular discharge noted bilaterally, which improved without intervention within 14 days. All other ocular parameters were unaffected throughout the study. Necropsy and histopathology revealed no evidence of systemic inflammation. Ocular histopathology was similar between MSC and control eyes. Fluorescent imaging analysis did not locate MSCs. Immunohistochemistry did not identify intact MSCs in the conjunctiva, but GFP-labeled cellular components were present in conjunctival phagocytic cells. DISCUSSION: Allogeneic pIC-activated conjunctival MSC injections were well tolerated. GFP-labeled tracking identified MSC components phagocytosed by immune cells subconjunctivally. This preliminary safety and tracking information is critical towards advancing immune conditioned cellular therapies to clinical trials in horses.",

PURPOSE: To assess whether overdose events in patients prescribed LTOT are associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND DATASET: Data from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse which includes de-identified medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment records for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees. The database contains longitudinal health information on patients, representing a mixture of ages and geographical regions across the United States. PATIENTS: Adults prescribed stable opioid therapy (≥10 morphine milligram equivalents/day) for a 6-month baseline period prior to an index opioid prescription from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. MAIN MEASURES: Health plan disenrollment during follow-up. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 404,151 patients who were followed up after 800,250 baseline periods of stable opioid dosing. During a mean follow-up of 9.1 months, unadjusted disenrollment rates among primary commercial beneficiaries and Medicare Advantage enrollees were 37.2 and 13.9 per 100 person-years, respectively. Incident overdoses were associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment with a statistically significantly stronger association among primary commercial insurance beneficiaries [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1.48 (95% CI: 1.33-1.64)] as compared to Medicare Advantage enrollees [aIRR 1.15 (95% CI: 1.07-1.23)]. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients prescribed long-term opioids, overdose events were strongly associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment, especially among primary commercial insurance beneficiaries. These findings raise concerns about the social consequences of overdose, including potential health insurance loss, which may limit patient access to care at a time of heightened vulnerability.",

Emerging as the next iteration of the MMPC Program which served the biomedical research community for 20 years (2001-2021), MMPCLive is designed as an outwardly-facing consortium of service cores that collaborate to provide reduced-cost consultation and metabolic, physiologic, and behavioral phenotyping tests on live mice for U.S. biomedical researchers. Four MMPCLive Centers located at universities around the country perform complex and often unique procedures in vivo on a fee for service basis, typically on mice shipped from the client or directly from a repository or vendor. Current areas of expertise include energy balance and body composition, insulin action and secretion, whole body carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cardiovascular and renal function, food intake and behavior, microbiome and xenometabolism, and metabolic pathway kinetics. Additionally, an opportunity arose to reduce barriers to access and expand the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by establishing the VIBRANT Program. Directed at researchers historically underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, VIBRANT-eligible investigators have access to testing services, travel and career development awards, expert advice and experimental design consultation, and short internships to learn test technologies. Data derived from experiments run by the Centers belongs to the researchers submitting mice for testing which can be made publicly available and accessible from the MMPCLive database following publication. In addition to services, MMPCLive staff provide expertise and advice to researchers, develop and refine test protocols, engage in outreach activities, publish scientific and technical papers, and conduct educational workshops and training sessions to aid researchers in unraveling the heterogeneity of diabetes and obesity.",

Ideas are investigated in the context of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. First, we find that industry scandals differentially affect contentious and collaborative SMOs' ability to mobilize resources. SMOs that had collaborated with the oil and gas industry before the spill suffered from reduced public support after the spill, and those that had contentiously interacted with the industry enjoyed increased contributions. Second, we find that industry scandals affect SMOs' willingness to collaborate with firms in the future. We show that the Horizon oil spill produced a broad chilling effect on environmental SMOs' collaborations with firms both within and outside of the oil and gas industry. Our findings show that there are risks inherent to a collaborative strategy that cannot be fully mitigated. Further, we demonstrate that industry scandals represent critical exogenous events that affect social activists' tactical repertoires for engaging in private politics.",

One surrogate of excellence during residency may be awards, especially those given for teaching and annual overall accomplishment. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether markers of superior performance during medical school documented in the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) application and student record correlated with receiving awards during residency. DESIGN: Data was analyzed from ERAS and student applications of 296 residency graduates. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated. PARTICIPANTS: 296 residency graduates from 14 US general surgery residency programs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASUREMENTS: The relationship between each residency and preresidency variable and the outcome of receiving any qualifying award. Secondary analysis included the correlation with winning a teaching or annual overall award. RESULTS: Although 140 (48%) residents received an award during residency, only 69 (23.3%) received a teaching award, while 50 (17.6%) received one for annual overall performance. Membership in Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) and honors in pediatrics rotation correlated with receiving any award. USMLE step 1 score and AOA membership reached statistically significant positively correlation with receiving a teaching award, while completing a sub-internship at that institution was negatively associated. For annual overall awards, only completing a sub-internship at the same institution reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: None of the traditional metrics in the ERAS or global student record consistently correlated with receiving an award during residency. Our findings suggest that preresidency factors available on the global application, including grades, test scores, and honor society membership, poorly correlate with exceptional general surgery residency performance as measured by receiving awards. Residency programs should shift away from using traditional ERAS metrics as the primary criteria for selection, but rather as 1 component of holistic applicant review.",

Lab testing was performed with a variety of fish, birds, turtles, and vertebrate cell lines (as well as invertebrates); field biologists conducted observations on fish, birds, turtles, and marine mammals; and epidemiologists carried out observational studies in humans. Eight years after the spill, scientists and resource managers held a workshop to summarize the similarities and differences in the effects of DWH oil on vertebrate taxa and to identify remaining gaps in our understanding of oil toxicity in wildlife and humans, building upon the cross-taxonomic synthesis initiated during the Natural Resource Damage Assessment. Across the studies, consistency was found in the types of toxic response observed in the different organisms. Impairment of stress responses and adrenal gland function, cardiotoxicity, immune system dysfunction, disruption of blood cells and their function, effects on locomotion, and oxidative damage were observed across taxa. This consistency suggests conservation in the mechanisms of action and disease pathogenesis. From a toxicological perspective, a logical progression of impacts was noted: from molecular and cellular effects that manifest as organ dysfunction, to systemic effects that compromise fitness, growth, reproductive potential, and survival. From a clinical perspective, adverse health effects from DWH oil spill exposure formed a suite of signs/symptomatic responses that at the highest doses/concentrations resulted in multi-organ system failure.",

      "abstract": "This Essay analyzes how aggressive activism in a California mountain town at the tail end of the nineteenth century commenced a chain reaction resulting in state and ultimately national anti-Chinese immigration laws. The constitutional immunity through which the Supreme Court upheld those laws deeply affected the future trajectory of U.S. immigration law and policy. Responding to sustained political pressure from the West, Congress in 1882 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, an infamous piece of unabashedly racist legislation that commenced a long process of barring immigration from all of Asia to the United States. In upholding the Act, the Supreme Court in an extraordinary decision that jars modern racial sensibilities declared that Congress possessed “plenary power”—absolute authority—over immigration and that racist immigration laws were immune from judicial review of their constitutionality. The bedrock of U.S. immigration jurisprudence for more than a century and never overruled by the Supreme Court, the plenary power doctrine permits the treatment of immigrants in racially discriminatory ways consistent with the era of Jim Crow but completely at odds with modern constitutional law. The doctrine enabled President Trump, a fierce advocate of tough-as-nails immigration measures, to pursue the most extreme immigration program of any modern president, with devastating impacts on noncitizens of color. As the nation attempts to grapple with the Trump administration’s brutal treatment of immigrants, it is an especially opportune historical moment to reconsider the plenary power doctrine. Ultimately, the commitment to remove systemic racism from the nation’s social fabric requires the dismantling of the doctrine and meaningful constitutional review of the immigration laws. That, in turn, would open the possibilities to the removal of systemic racial injustice from immigration law and policy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tapering of chronic opioids has increased, with subsequent reports of exacerbated pain among patients who tapered. We aimed to evaluate the association between opioid dose tapering and subsequent pain-related healthcare utilization (emergency department [ED] visits, hospitalizations and primary care visits). DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from years 2015-2019 using data from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse that contains de-identified retrospective administrative claims data for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees in the United States. Adults aged ≥18 years who were prescribed stable doses of opioids, ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, during a 12-month baseline period. METHODS: Tapering was defined as ≥15% relative reduction in mean daily opioid dose during one of 6 overlapping 60-day periods. Tapered patient-periods were subclassified as tapered-and-continued (MME > 0) vs tapered-and-discontinued (MME = 0). We modeled monthly counts of visits for pain diagnoses up to 12 months after cohort entry using negative binomial regression as a function of tapering, baseline utilization, and patient level-covariates. RESULTS: Among 47 033 patients, 13 793 patients tapered. Compared to no taper, any taper was associated with more ED visits for pain (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.30), tapered then continued status was associated with more ED visits (aIRR 1.23, CI: 1.14-1.32) and hospitalizations (aIRR 1.14, CI: 1.03-1.27) f-or pain, and tapered-and-discontinued was associated with fewer primary care visits for pain (aIRR 0.68, CI: 0.61-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: These associations suggest that opioid tapering may lead to increased emergency and hospital utilization for acute pain and possibly a decreased perceived need for primary care for those whose opioids were discontinued.",

Prior research theorizes how trans workers get repositioned in a binary, patriarchal gender order, but we lack a conceptual model to explain the labor market experience of people who are systematically sanctioned as gender deviants. By analyzing work history interviews from 23 trans women of color based across the United States, this article argues that crossing gender boundaries is a racialized experience that can come with an economic cost. After transitioning, trans women of color face three forms of economic sanctioning: exclusion, a racially gendered glass ceiling, and constrained employment options within a segmented labor market. Thus, work organizations premised on a hierarchical classification scheme have the option, not only to reposition people on the basis of a classification change, but to deem them unassimilable.</jats:p>",

Recent evidence suggests that even young children hold such mindsets; yet, no reliable and valid instruments exist for measuring individual differences in young children's mindsets. Given the potential relevance of mindsets to children's achievement-related behavior and learning, we developed and tested the psychometric properties of the Growth Mindset Scale for Children (GM-C). Among other psychometric properties, we assessed this instrument's (a) factor structure, (b) measurement invariance, (c) internal consistency, (d) temporal stability (test-retest reliability), (e) concurrent validity, and (f) cross-cultural robustness in samples of US children (Study 1; N = 220; ages 4 through 6; 50% girls; 39% White) and South African children (Study 2; predominantly grades 4 and 5; N = 331; 54% girls; 100% non-White). The GM-C scale exhibited four factors, representing beliefs about the instability of low ability, the malleability of low ability, the instability of high ability, and the malleability of high ability. The GM-C scale also demonstrated invariance across age, acceptable internal consistency (αs between .70 to .90), and moderate temporal stability over approximately one month (rs between .38 to .72). Concurrent validity was supported by significant relations between children's scores on the subscales about low ability and their goal orientations (Studies 1 and 2), challenge-seeking behavior, and achievement in math and English (Study 2). These findings suggest that the GM-C scale is a promising tool for measuring mindsets in young children. We offer practical recommendations for using this new scale and discuss theoretical implications.",

Exposure risk decreased as household income and neighborhood collective efficacy increased, though stark racial/ethnic inequities remained. Across racial/ethnic groups, adolescents in poor households in moderate or high collective efficacy neighborhoods had a similar risk of past-year firearm homicide exposure as middle-to-high income adolescents in low collective efficacy neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Empowering communities to build and leverage social ties may be as impactful for reducing firearm violence exposure as income supports. Comprehensive violence prevention efforts should include systems-level strategies that jointly strengthen family and community resources.",

We updated our co-morbidity scoring tool to the Assessment of Obesity-related Metabolic Conditions (AOMC) to combine pharmacotherapy and biochemical data to score diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and dyslipidemia (DYS) severity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine whether the AOMC system more accurately stages metabolic disease severity than a clinically based Assessment of Obesity-Related Comorbidities (AORC) system. SETTING: University hospital, United States. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected demographic, clinical, and biochemical data was performed on adults evaluated for bariatric surgery over 6years. AORC versus AOMC scores and disease severity were compared using McNemar's and Wilcoxon's tests. RESULTS: Of 1442 patients, AOMC newly diagnosed metabolic disease in more patients than did AORC: DM (73.4% versus 44.5%), HTN (91.7% versus 67.9%), and DYS (63.8% versus 53.4%). Of those on pharmacotherapy, AOMC found fewer patients with adequately controlled disease: DM (39.9% versus 97.7%), HTN (64.7% versus 99.3%), and DYS (51.8% versus 99.0%). For those in whom both scores could be calculated, disease severity was upstaged in most patients: DM (65.9%), HTN (42.9%), and DYS (30.9%). There were also significant shifts toward higher scores for all conditions and severity classifications, with more patients diagnosed with pre-metabolic and severe disease (untreated/uncontrolled). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the severity of DM, HTN, and DYS is vastly under-represented by clinical history alone and lacks standardized assessments. Our AOMC tool more accurately describes longitudinal metabolic response to bariatric surgery.",

Myriad articles highlighting this problem and proposing solutions have had little impact on its progression. OBJECTIVES: To discuss reasons for ED crowding leading to hallway care, the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, potential solutions, and why little has changed despite widespread awareness. DISCUSSION: ED crowding has been a public health issue for the past three decades, leading to patient care and boarding of admitted patients in ED hallways with limited resources. This care is often substandard and precarious. The COVID-19 pandemic placed further strain on the ED safety net, especially in certain urban areas. Despite recognition of the problem, publication of studies, and proposals offering many solutions, this problem continues to worsen. Corporate and hospital leadership must be made aware of the financial and legal ramifications for failure to address potential solutions, such as inpatient hallway boarding, provision of flexible expansion care areas, smoothing of elective admissions/surgeries, and efficient inpatient discharge flow. State and federal legislation may also be required to motivate this process. CONCLUSIONS: ED crowding and hallway care will continue to worsen unless hospital leadership is willing to listen to ED staff concerns and address the problem on all levels of the hospital using previously proposed solutions. Emergency physicians should not fear termination for discussing this issue and its potential for poor clinical outcomes and ED staff morale.",

Yet, few experiments have investigated its potential to improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency for high-yielding maize production in the U.S. Midwest. We tested the hypothesis that biochar application increases inorganic soil N availability during maize growth, leading to higher grain yields and N recovery efficiency while reducing the risk of N leaching following harvest. Four N fertilizer rates (0, 90, 179, and 269 kg ha−1 as urea ammonium nitrate [UAN] solution) were applied with or without biochar (10 Mg ha−1) before planting in a two-year field study. Inorganic soil N concentration was measured during the growing season (0–15 cm), and deep soil cores were obtained following harvest (0–90 cm). Results show that biochar did not affect maize yield, crop N uptake, or N recovery efficiency (by the difference method) across N rates, and there was no biochar by N rate interaction. While biochar lowered soil inorganic N concentrations on several sampling dates, this did not translate into seasonal differences in cumulative soil N availability, although grain yields in the unfertilized control were ~10% lower with biochar, suggesting net N immobilization. Biochar partially reduced the risk of N leaching following harvest by decreasing soil N concentrations at 30–60 cm, but mean concentrations for 0–90 cm were not different. Compared to previous work highlighting the benefits of biochar in arid climates with low soil fertility, we found no evidence of increased crop yield, NRE, or reduced risk of N leaching on Mollisols in a temperate climate.",

In contrast to static scaling procedures, this method allows for changes in the mappings between issue attitudes and the underlying ideological dimension over time. The results indicate that over the last forty years, mass attitudes on a range of long-standing policy controversies better fit a unidimensional ideological structure. As among elites, the left–right dimension has come to encompass a wide range of policy, partisan, and value divides in the mass public. Further, these trends hold for voters at all levels of political sophistication.

Three weighing lysimeters were used to measure water losses every 30 min to obtain the daily actual evapotranspiration (ETA) of young peach trees. Kc was calculated using the measured water losses and grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Kc was plotted against the day of the year (DOY), a quadratic equation was fitted to the data, and the estimated Kc ranged from 0.22 to 0.67. The second experiment was conducted from September 2016 to August 2018. Soil volumetric water content was recorded every 10 min on the first 90 cm of the soil profile to calculate a soil water balance that could determine the crop evapotranspiration (ETc). The average daily Kc was calculated by the ratio of ETc to ETo and plotted against DOY. A quadratic equation was fitted to the data, and the estimated Kc ranged from 0.32 to 0.69.",

      "abstract": "Escherichia coli is the most common cause of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in dogs. UTI recurrence comprises of persistent, unresolved E. coli infection or reinfection with a different strain of E. coli. Differentiating between these processes is clinically important but is often impossible with routine diagnostics. We tested the hypothesis that most recurrent canine E. coli bacteriuria is due to recurrence of the same E. coli strain involved in the initial infection. Molecular typing was performed on 98 urinary E. coli isolated from dogs with recurrent bacteriuria from five veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the United States. Of the 42 dogs in this study with multiple E. coli bacteriuria observations, a single strain of E. coli caused recurrent bacteriuria in 26 (62 %) dogs, in some cases on multiple occasions for prolonged periods of time (up to eight months). A single E. coli strain was detected during both subclinical bacteriuria and clinically-apparent UTI in three dogs. Isolates with the P-fimbrial adhesin genes papA and papC were associated with recurrence by the same strain of E. coli. Multiple isolations of a single strain of E. coli associated with recurrent bacteriuria suggests that E. coli may be maintained within the urinary tract of some dogs for prolonged periods of time. In some patients, the same strain can cause both clinical UTI and subclinical bacteriuria. This indicates that in dogs, the urinary bladder may serve as a subclinical, long-term reservoir of E. coli that may cause clinical UTI in the future.",

      "abstract": "Improving food security and dietary quality during pregnancy is vital for maternal and infant health. Poor nutrition can lead to adverse fetal development and complications for women. In 2009, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infant, and Children (WIC), a US safety net program for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women and young children, was revised to improve dietary quality, promoting intake of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Prior studies found the revision improved dietary quality, but its impact on downstream health is less understood. We analyzed 2008-2012 national birth certificate data (N = 11,855,417) and employed a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis to examine pre-post trends in outcomes among women predicted to be to be eligible for WIC (treatment group) while \"differencing\" out pre-post trends among predicted WIC-ineligible women (control group). Outcomes include infant birth weight and size for gestational age, and maternal gestational-diabetes-mellitus (GDM) and gestational-weight gain (GWG). The 2009 WIC revision was associated with small reductions in birth weight (-3.52 g; 95 %CI, -4.75 to -2.30) and small-for-gestational-age (-0.08 % points; 95 %CI, -0.15, -0.01), and GWG (-0.05 pounds; 95 %CI, -0.09, -0.02). While the results were robust to most sensitivity tests, they were not for some and therefore should be interpreted cautiously. Disparities emerged in the impact on GDM and GWG across subgroups. The limited evidence of positive effects on infant and maternal health underscores the need for ongoing research to better understand the impact of the 2019 WIC revision, including implementation factors and program design, on downstream health.",

Hospitals throughout the USA and the residency programs housed therein have drastically altered their standard operations to slow the spread of disease. Maintaining the educational mission of a residency program within the parameters of social distancing mandates is an unprecedented challenge to graduate medical education and will remain so for the near future. We evaluated resident perception of our efforts to transition educational activities within the residency to an online, remote format utilizing Microsoft SharePoint. Educational conferences were transitioned to a videoconferencing platform on March 13, 2020 in conjunction with the deployment of an intradepartmental Microsoft SharePoint site to provide educational resources, disseminate scheduling changes, and provide wellness resources in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. An 11-question survey available from 4 Jan 2020-4 Jun 2020 surveyed resident perceptions of the instituted changes. Twenty-six of 31 residents (83.8%) responded to the resident survey invitation. Twenty-four of 26 residents (92.3%) characterized the SharePoint as useful. Twenty of 26 residents (76.9%) desired attending guidance as to how to utilize the online resources for each resident rotation. A total of 92.3% (24/26) of residents felt that the program's response utilizing SharePoint engendered a greater sense of belonging to their work community. Resident perception of the transition to online learning utilizing Microsoft SharePoint as a distribution platform was generally positive, helping to mitigate untoward educational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "abstract": "Beer has over 600 flavor compounds and creates a positive tasting experience with acceptable sensory properties, which are essential for the best consumer experience. Spontaneous and mixed-culture fermentation beers, generally classified as sour beers, are gaining popularity compared to typical lager or ale styles, which have dominated in the USA for the last few decades. Unique and acceptable flavor compounds characterize sour beers, but some unfavorable aspects appear in conjunction. One such unfavorable flavor is called \"mousy\". This description is usually labeled as an unpleasant odor, identifying spoilage of fermented food and beverages. It is related as having the odor of mouse urine, cereal, corn tortilla chips, or freshly baked sour bread. The main compounds responsible for it are N-heterocyclic compounds: 2-acetyltetrahydropyridine, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, and 2-ethyltetrahydropyridine. The most common beverages associated with mousy off-flavor are identified in wines, sour beers, other grain-based beverages, and kombucha, which may contain heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, and/or yeast/fungus cultures. In particular, the fungal species Brettanomyces bruxellensis are associated with mousy-off flavor occurrence in fermented beverages matrices. However, many factors for N-heterocycle formation are not well-understood. Currently, the research and development of mixed-cultured beer and non/low alcohol beverages (NABLAB) has increased to obtain the highest quality, sensory, functionality, and most notably safety standards, and also to meet consumers' demand for a balanced sourness in these beverages. This paper introduces mousy off-flavor expression in beers and beverages, which occurs in spontaneous or mixed-culture fermentations, with a focus on sour beers due to common inconsistency aspects in fermentation. We discuss and suggest possible pathways of mousy off-flavor development in the beer matrix, which also apply to other fermented beverages, including non/low alcohol drinks, e.g., kombucha and low/nonalcohol beers. Some precautions and modifications may prevent the occurrence of these off-flavor compounds in the beverage matrix: improving raw material quality, adjusting brewing processes, and using specific strains of yeast and bacteria that are less likely to produce the off-flavor. Conceivably, it is clear that spontaneous and mixed culture fermentation is gaining popularity in industrial, craft, and home brewing. The review discusses important elements to identify and understand metabolic pathways, following the prevention of spoilage targeted to off-flavor compounds development in beers and NABLABs.",

      "abstract": "Science-informed decisions are best guided by the objective synthesis of the totality of evidence around a particular question and assessing its trustworthiness through systematic processes. However, there are major barriers and challenges that limit science-informed food and nutrition policy, practice, and guidance. First, insufficient evidence, primarily due to acquisition cost of generating high-quality data, and the complexity of the diet-disease relationship. Furthermore, the sheer number of systematic reviews needed across the entire agriculture and food value chain, and the cost and time required to conduct them, can delay the translation of science to policy. Artificial intelligence offers the opportunity to (i) better understand the complex etiology of diet-related chronic diseases, (ii) bring more precision to our understanding of the variation among individuals in the diet-chronic disease relationship, (iii) provide new types of computed data related to the efficacy and effectiveness of nutrition/food interventions in health promotion, and (iv) automate the generation of systematic reviews that support timely decisions. These advances include the acquisition and synthesis of heterogeneous and multimodal datasets. This perspective summarizes a meeting convened at the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The purpose of the meeting was to examine the current state and future potential of artificial intelligence in generating new types of computed data as well as automating the generation of systematic reviews to support evidence-based food and nutrition policy, practice, and guidance.",

Spatial estimates of biomass yields under different management regimes are required for assisting stakeholders in making better management decisions and to establish viable woody cropping systems for biofuel production. To support stakeholders in their management decisions, we have developed a GIS-based web interface using a modified 3PG model for spatially predicting poplar biomass yields under different management and climate conditions in the U.S. Pacific Northwest region. The application is implemented with standard HTML5 components, allowing its use in a modern browser and dynamically adjusting to the client screen size and device. In addition, cloud storage of the results makes them accessible on any Internet-enabled device. The web interface appears simple, but is powerful in parameter manipulation and in visualizing and sharing the results. Overall, this application comprises dynamic features that enable users to run SRWC crop growth simulations based on GIS information and contributes significantly to choosing appropriate feedstock growing locations, anticipating the desired physiological properties of the feedstock and incorporating the management and policy analysis needed for growing hybrid poplar plantations.",

The sensitivity and uncertainty of some key parameters were analyzed. The predicted transport masses of these formulation agents in surface water were strongly associated with rainfall. While predicted transport masses were quite small at the watershed scale (<0.01% of applied masses), they were 26-31 times higher in certain locales at the subbasin level.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The majority of peppers in the US for fresh market and processing are handpicked, and harvesting can account for 20-50% of production costs. Innovation in mechanical harvesting would increase availability; lower the costs of local, healthy vegetable products; and perhaps improve food safety and expand markets. Most processed peppers require removal of pedicels (stem and calyx) from the fruit, but lack of an efficient mechanical process for this operation has hindered adoption of mechanical harvest. In this paper, we present characterization and advancements in breeding green chile peppers for mechanical harvesting. Specifically, we describe inheritance and expression of an easy-destemming trait derived from the landrace UCD-14 that facilitates machine harvest of green chiles. Methods: A torque gauge was used for measuring bending forces similar to those of a harvester and applied to two biparental populations segregating for destemming force and rate. Genotyping by sequencing was used to generate genetic maps for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. Results: A major destemming QTL was found on chromosome 10 across populations and environments. Eight additional population and/or environment-specific QTL were also identified. Chromosome 10 QTL markers were used to help introgress the destemming trait into jalapeño-type peppers. Low destemming force lines combined with improvements in transplant production enabled mechanical harvest of destemmed fruit at a rate of 41% versus 2% with a commercial jalapeńo hybrid. Staining for the presence of lignin at the pedicel/fruit boundary indicated the presence of an abscission zone and homologs of genes known to affect organ abscission were found under several QTL, suggesting that the easy-destemming trait may be due to the presence and activation of a pedicel/fruit abscission zone. Conclusion: Presented here are tools to measure the easy-destemming trait, its physiological basis, possible molecular pathways, and expression of the trait in various genetic backgrounds. Mechanical harvest of destemmed mature green chile fruits was achieved by combining easy-destemming with transplant management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke is a sudden-onset, uncontrollable event; stroke-related stress may impede rehabilitation and recovery. Lifetime stress may sensitize patients to experiencing greater stroke-related stress and indirectly affect outcomes. We examine lifetime stress as predictor of poststroke acute stress and examine lifetime and acute stress as predictors of 3- and 12-month functional status. We also compare acute stress and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale as predictors of poststroke functional status. METHODS: Between 2016 and 2020 the STRONG Study (Stroke, Stress, Rehabilitation, and Genetics) enrolled adults with new radiologically confirmed stroke 2 to 10 days poststroke onset at 28 acute care US hospitals. Participants were interviewed 3 times: acute admission (acute stress; Acute Stress Disorder Interview), 3 months (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity motor impairment [Fugl-Meyer Upper Arm Assessment; N=431], modified Rankin Scale [3 months; N=542], Stroke Impact Scale-Activities of Daily Living [3 months; N=511], Lifetime Stress Exposure Inventory), and 12 months (modified Rankin Scale, N=533; Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 Activities of Daily Living; N=485; Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment; N=484) poststroke. Structural equation models examined whether acute stress predicted 3- and 12-month functional outcomes, and mediated an association between lifetime stress and outcomes controlling for demographics and initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Standardized betas are reported. RESULTS: Sample (N=763) was 19 to 95 years old (mean=63; SD=14.9); 448 (58.7%) were male. Acute stress scores ranged from 0 to 14 (mean, 3.52 [95% CI, 3.31-3.73]). Controlling for age, gender, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and race and ethnicity, higher lifetime stress predicted higher acute stress (β=0.18, P<0.001), which predicted lower 3-month Fugl-Meyer Upper Arm Assessment scores (β=-0.19, P<0.001), lower Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 Activities of Daily Living scores at 3 months (β=-0.21, P<0.001) and 12 months (β=-0.21, P<0.001), higher modified Rankin Scale scores at 3 months (β=0.23, P<0.001) and 12 months (β=0.22, P<0.001), and lower 12-month Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (β=-0.20, P<0.001). Acute stress predicted 12-month tMoCA (χ2[1]=5.29, P=0.022) more strongly, 3-month and 12-month modified Rankin Scale and SIS scores as strongly (all Ps>0.18), but Fugl-Meyer scores (χ2[1]=7.01, P=0.008) less strongly than baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime stress/trauma is associated with more poststroke acute stress, which is associated with greater motor and cognitive impairment and disability 3 and 12 months poststroke. Poststroke interventions for acute stress may help mitigate stroke-related disability.",

This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical origin of the mindset culture and examines its potential to reduce group-based inequalities in education. In particular, experiments have identified two broad ways the mindset culture is communicated by teachers: via informal messages about growth (e.g., that all students will be helped to learn and succeed), and formal opportunities to improve (e.g., learning-focused grading policies and opportunities to revise and earn credit). New field experiments, applying techniques from behavioral science, have also revealed effective ways to influence teachers' culture-creating behaviors. This paper describes recent breakthroughs in the U.S. educational context and discusses how lessons from these studies might be applied in future, global collaborations with researchers and practitioners.",

      "abstract": "Canine distemper is a severe and lethal viral disease of dogs and wild carnivores with an urgent need for the identification of effective antiviral agents against canine distemper virus (CDV). We assessed multiple agents for their ability to block the replication of three different lineages of CDV isolated from wild carnivores in the United States. Six antiviral compounds were selected after preliminary experiments that excluded ribavirin, hesperidin and rutin: a protease inhibitor (nirmatrelvir), a polymerase inhibitor (favipiravir) and four nucleoside analogs (remdesivir, GS-441524, EIDD2801 and EIDD1931). Antiviral efficacy was determined by the attenuation of the cytopathic effect in a CDV-susceptible cell line and the inhibition of viral RNA replication. The nucleoside analog GS-441524 effectively blocked the replication of CDV at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Four other antiviral agents inhibited CDV replication to a lesser degree (remdesivir, nirmatrelvir, EIDD2801 and EIDD1931). The replication of different viral lineages was differentially inhibited by the antivirals. Several of the nucleoside analogs have been safely used previously in carnivore species for the treatment of other viral diseases, suggesting that they may be promising candidates for the treatment of canine distemper in dogs. Our results emphasize the need to consider different viral lineages in the screening of antiviral compounds.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in men. Initially, it is androgen-dependent, but it eventually develops into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is incurable with current androgen receptor signaling target therapy and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy, specifically with immune checkpoint inhibitors, has brought hope for the treatment of this type of prostate cancer. Approaches such as vaccines, adoptive chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cells, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been employed to activate innate and adaptive immune responses to treat prostate cancer, but with limited success. Only Sipuleucel-T and the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab are approved by the US FDA for the treatment of limited prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer has a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) in which various immunosuppressive molecules and mechanisms coexist and interact. Additionally, prostate cancer is considered a \"cold\" tumor with low levels of tumor mutational burden, low amounts of antigen-presenting and cytotoxic T-cell activation, and high levels of immunosuppressive molecules including cytokines/chemokines. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of immunosuppressive signaling activation and immune evasion will help develop more effective treatments for prostate cancer. The purpose of this review is to summarize emerging advances in prostate cancer immunotherapy, with a particular focus on the molecular mechanisms that lead to immune evasion in prostate cancer. At the same time, we also highlight some potential therapeutic targets to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of prostate cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When selecting surgical residents, programs emphasize quantifiable data from the Electronic Residency Application Service application. However, it is unclear whether Electronic Residency Application Service data are associated with future resident performance or any of the qualities (surgical judgment, leadership, and medical knowledge) that our group has identified as being predictive of graduate performance. Our objective was to determine whether residency application variables are associated with subsequent residency graduate performance as rated by surgical educators. METHODS: Faculty from 12 general surgery residency programs rated graduates from 2017 to 2020 on 4 outcomes: overall performance, surgical judgment, leadership, and medical knowledge. Graduates' Electronic Residency Application Service data were collected, including medical school type, United States Medical Examination scores, honors society memberships, extracurriculars, clerkship honors, and class rank. Data were analyzed using the Spearman rank-order correlation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was performed to select a model predictive of each outcome from preresidency variables. RESULTS: A total of 258 graduates were evaluated. Regarding overall residency graduate performance rating, there were weak associations with the United States Medical Examination step 2 score (r = 0.23, P < .01); honors in family medicine (r = 0.17, P = .02), obstetrics/gynecology (r = 0.17, P = .01), pediatrics (r = 0.15, P = .02), and surgery (r = 0.14, P = .03); proportion of clerkship honors (r = 0.2, P < .01); and class rank (r = 0.18, P = .03). None of the preresidency variables were selected for a predictive model via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for any of the 4 outcomes measured. CONCLUSION: There is a weak correlation between measurable residency application data and subsequent resident performance as rated by surgical educators. On least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, no residency application variables were predictive of graduate performance. These findings question the value of measurable application data in resident selection and highlight the importance of cultivating outstanding surgeons throughout training.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Awareness of prescribing practices helps identify opportunities to improve antibiotic use (AU). OBJECTIVES: To estimate AU prevalence in dogs and cats in U.S. veterinary teaching hospitals (VTHs) and identify antibiotic drugs commonly prescribed, indications for use, and evidence of bacterial infection. ANIMALS: Medical record data were collected from dogs and cats examined at 14 VTHs. METHODS: Data were collected from VTH medical records of dogs and cats examined by primary care, urgent care, emergency and critical care, internal medicine, and surgery services on a single day during August 13-September 3, 2020. Data included signalment; clinical service; inpatient or outpatient status; clinical conditions; diagnostic tests; evidence of bacterial infection; intended reason for AU; name and route of antibiotics prescribed. RESULTS: Of 883 dogs and cats, 322 (36.5%) were prescribed at least 1 antibiotic. Among 285 antibiotics administered systemically intended for treatment of infection, 10.9% were prescribed without evidence of infection. The most common class of antibiotics presribed for systemic administration was potentiated penicillin for dogs (115/346, 33.3%) and cats (27/80, 33.8%). For dogs and cats, first-generation cephalosporins (93/346, 26.9% and 11/80, 13.8%, respectively) and fluoroquinolones (51/346, 14.7% and 19/80, 23.8%, respectively) was second or third most-prescribed. Common AU indications included skin, respiratory, and urinary conditions, and perioperative use. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Collaborative data collection provides a sustainable methodology to generate national AU prevalence estimates and bring attention to areas requiring additional research and detailed data collection. These efforts can also identify practice improvement opportunities in settings where future veterinarians are trained.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: In this systematic review, the authors examine the prevalence and extent of stigmatizing attitudes among health care professionals (HCPs) and trainees against patients with substance use disorders (SUDs), including research on interventions to reduce stigma. METHOD: The authors searched 7 databases for articles published from January 1, 2011, through February 15, 2023, that quantified SUD stigma among HCPs or trainees. Inclusion criteria allowed both observational and intervention studies from the United States or Canada to be included in this review. Quality assessment was applied to all included studies; studies were not excluded based on quality. RESULTS: A total of 1,992 unique articles were identified of which 32 articles (17 observational studies and 15 intervention studies), all conducted in the United States, met the inclusion criteria. Half of the included studies (16 of 32) were published in 2020 or later. Most of the intervention studies (13 of 15) used a single-group pre-post design; interventions involved didactics and/or interactions with persons with SUDs. The 32 included studies used a total of 19 different measures of stigma. All 17 observational studies showed some degree of HCP or trainee stigma against patients with SUDs. Most intervention studies (12 of 15) found small but statistically significant reductions in stigma after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: SUD stigma exists among HCPs and trainees. Some interventions to reduce this stigma had positive impacts, but future studies with larger, diverse participants and comparison groups are needed. Heterogeneity among studies and stigma measures limits the ability to interpret results across studies. Future rigorous research is needed to determine validated, consensus measures of SUD stigma among HCPs and trainees, identify stigma scores that are associated with clinical outcomes, and develop effective antistigma interventions for HCPs and trainees.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures and social determinants likely influence specific childhood asthma phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the Child Opportunity Index (COI) at birth, measuring multiple neighborhood opportunities, influences incidence rates (IRs) for asthma with recurrent exacerbations (ARE). METHODS: We tested for COI associations with ARE IRs in 15,877 children born between 1990 and 2018 in the ECHO (Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes) program. Parent-reported race and ethnicity and other demographics were assessed as effect modifiers. RESULTS: The IRs of ARE for children born in very low COI neighborhoods was higher (IR = 10.98; 95% CI: 9.71, 12.25) than for other COI categories. Rates for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children were significantly higher than non-Hispanic White children in every COI category. The ARE IRs for children born in very low COI neighborhoods were several-fold higher for NHB and Hispanic Black children (IR = 15.30; 95% CI: 13.10, 17.49; and IR = 18.48; 95% CI: 8.80, 28.15, respectively) when compared to White children. Adjusting for individual-level characteristics, children born in very low COI neighborhoods demonstrated an ARE IR ratio of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.59) with a higher incidence of cases among children ages 2 to 4 years and with a parental history of asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of ARE were higher among children born in under-resourced communities, and this relationship is strongest for young minoritized children with a parental history of asthma. Higher rates for NHB even in the highest COI categories suggest that risk associated with race persists regardless of social disadvantage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are effective in germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation-associated metastatic breast cancer. However, studies evaluating PARP inhibitors plus platinum-based chemotherapy in germline BRCA1/2-wildtype triple-negative breast cancer are scarce. A large proportion of germline BRCA1/2-wildtype triple-negative breast cancer shows homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), resulting in a BRCA-like phenotype that might render sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The S1416 trial assessed the efficacy of cisplatin combined with the PARP inhibitor veliparib in three predefined groups of metastatic breast cancer: germline BRCA1/2-mutated, BRCA-like, and non-BRCA-like. METHODS: S1416 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial conducted at 154 community and academic clinical sites across the USA. Eligible patients aged 18 years or older had metastatic or recurrent triple-negative breast cancer or germline BRCA1/2-associated metastatic or recurrent breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had received up to one line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via the National Clinical Trials Network open interactive system with dynamic balancing on number of previous cytotoxic regimens for metastatic disease to receive intravenous cisplatin (75 mg/m2, day 1) combined with either veliparib or matching placebo (300 mg orally twice a day, days 1-14) on a 21-day cycle. Investigators, patients, and the sponsors were masked to treatment assignment; the study statisticians were unmasked. Central testing after ran domisation classified patients as having mutated or wildtype germline BRCA1/2. A biomarker panel established a priori was used to classify patients with wildtype germline BRCA1/2 into BRCA-like and non-BRCA-like phenotype groups, with BRCA-like status based on at least one of the biomarkers: genomic instability score (≥42), somatic BRCA1/2 mutations, BRCA1 promoter methylation, or non-BRCA1/2 homologous recombination repair germline mutations. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, analysed separately for the three predefined biomarker groups with a prespecified α value for each analysis. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and included all eligible patients. Safety analyses of toxicities attributed to treatment included all patients who received at least one dose of veliparib or placebo. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02595905. FINDINGS: Between July 7, 2016, and June 15, 2019, 335 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. 320 patients (n=162 to cisplatin plus veliparib, all women; and n=158 to cisplatin plus placebo, 157 women and one man) were eligible for efficacy evaluation. 247 patients were classified into the three biomarker groups: germline BRCA1/2-mutated (n=37), BRCA-like (n=101), and non-BRCA-like (n=109). 73 patients could not be classified due to missing biomarker information. Median follow-up was 11·1 months (IQR 5·6-20·8). In the germline BRCA1/2-mutated group, median progression-free survival was 6·2 months (95% CI 2·3-9·2) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group and 6·4 months (4·3-8·2) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·79 [95% CI 0·38-1·67]; log-rank p=0·54). In the BRCA-like group, median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 4·3-7·8) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group versus 4·2 months (2·3-5·0) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·57 [95% CI 0·37-0·88]; p=0·010). In the non-BRCA-like group, median progression-free survival was 4·0 months (95% CI 2·5-4·7) in the cisplatin plus veliparib group versus 3·0 months (2·2-4·4) in the cisplatin plus placebo group (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·60-1·33]; p=0·57). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events attributed to treatment were neutropenia (71 [46%] of 155 patients in the cisplatin plus veliparib group vs 29 [20%] of 147 in the cisplatin plus placebo group), leukopenia (42 [27%] vs 11 [7%]), anaemia (35 [23%] vs 12 [8%]), and thrombocytopenia (29 [19%] vs four [3%]). Serious adverse events attributed to treatment occurred in 48 (31%) patients in the cisplatin plus veliparib group and 53 (36%) patients in the cisplatin plus placebo group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in one patient in the cisplatin plus veliparib group (sepsis) and one patient in the cisplatin plus placebo group (acute kidney injury due to cisplatin plus heart failure from previous doxorubicin exposure). INTERPRETATION: The addition of veliparib to cisplatin significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with BRCA-like metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but not in patients with non-BRCA-like metastatic breast cancer.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:: This study examined changes in geographic proximity to family members among race and income groups in the United States from 1981 to 2017. BACKGROUND:: Close geographic proximity to family members can facilitate mutual support and strengthen family bonds. Some scholars argue that institutional sources of support have replaced many core family functions, which might mean that households are likely to live increasingly farther away from family. Advancing technology and changing labor market opportunities might reinforce this pattern. Yet, the ongoing cultural and emotional salience of family might curtail the effects of these factors on the increasing distance to family. METHOD:: We conducted a quantitative analysis of longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We utilized the multigenerational structure of the PSID and restricted-use geocodes to map kin proximity at every interview from 1981 to 2017. We cross-classified our sample by race and income, focusing on Black and White respondents across income quartiles (n = 171,501 person-periods). RESULTS:: High-income White respondents showed the greatest increases in distance from kin over time, whereas proximity to kin among other race-income groups was relatively stable. CONCLUSION:: Proximate kin has become less central in the lives of high-income White households over time, whereas close proximity to kin has been the norm over time for other racial and income groups. These results have implications for racial and income differences in kin relations over time.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association between surgical volume and patient outcome is well established, with higher case volume associated with a lower risk of complications. We hypothesized that the geographic distribution of endocrine/head and neck surgeons with an endocrine focus in the United States and Puerto Rico may limit access to many potential patients, particularly in rural areas. METHODS: We used web-based directories from the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, American Head and Neck Society, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery to identify endocrine surgery specialists in the United States and Puerto Rico. Using geographic coordinates and OpenStreetMap and Valhalla software, we calculated the areas within a 60-, 90-, or 120-minute driving distance from specialist offices. We used 2020 U.S. Census Data to calculate census tract populations inside or outside the accessible areas. RESULTS: Excluding duplicate providers across organizations, we geocoded 603 specialist addresses in the United States and Puerto. We found that 23.76% (78.3 million) of Americans do not have access to a society-affiliated endocrine/head and neck surgeon with an endocrine focus within a 60-minute drive, 14.37% (47.4 million) within a 90-minute drive, and 8.38% (27.6 million) within a 120-minute drive. We observed that the areas of coverage are primarily focused on metropolitan areas. CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third of Americans do not have access to a society-affiliated endocrine/head and neck surgeon with an endocrine focus within a 1-hour drive, highlighting a concerning geographic barrier to care. Further work is needed to facilitate patient access and mitigate disparities in quality care.",

Appropriate selection of antimicrobial drugs is an important part of veterinary education, but many veterinary students report that they have knowledge gaps in this area. Students with greater self-efficacy, the belief that one can perform the individual steps that comprise a task, tend to expend more effort and motivation in learning new skills. Educational activities that improve self-efficacy can increase student motivation, but appropriate assessment tools tailored for specific educational domains are necessary to support these efforts. The purpose of this study was to validate an online survey instrument to measure veterinary student self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection. The secondary goal was to determine if clinical training increases veterinary students' self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection. A total of 380 students from seven veterinary colleges in the United States completed an online survey instrument that asked students to self-assess their abilities to perform 13 tasks associated with antimicrobial selection on a 10-point Likert-type scale. A principal components analysis identified three factors associated with self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection: (a) empirical selection and dosing of antimicrobials, (b) identification of trustworthy resources and resistance to pressure to prescribe, and (c) knowledge of when antimicrobials are needed. Self-efficacy for antimicrobial selection increases the most in the fourth year of veterinary training. However, exposure to at least one clinical rotation was not associated with higher self-efficacy for selection of antimicrobials.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy poses a substantial threat to efforts to mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To combat vaccine hesitancy, officials in the United States issued vaccine mandates, which were met with strong antivaccine discourse on social media platforms such as Reddit. The politicized and polarized nature of COVID-19 on social media has fueled uncivil discourse related to vaccine mandates, which is known to decrease confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the moral foundations underlying uncivil COVID-19 vaccine discourse. Moral foundations theory poses that individuals make decisions to express approval or disapproval (ie, uncivil discourse) based on innate moral values. We examine whether moral foundations are associated with dimensions of incivility. Further, we explore whether there are any differences in the presence of incivility between the r/coronaviruscirclejerk and r/lockdownskepticism subreddits. METHODS: Natural language processing methodologies were leveraged to analyze the moral foundations underlying uncivil discourse in 2 prominent antivaccine subreddits, r/coronaviruscirclejerk and r/lockdownskepticism. All posts and comments from both of the subreddits were collected since their inception in March 2022. This was followed by filtering the data set for key terms associated with the COVID-19 vaccine (eg, \"vaccinate\" and \"Pfizer\") and mandates (eg, \"forced\" and \"mandating\"). These key terms were selected based on a review of existing literature and because of their salience in both of the subreddits. A 10% sample of the filtered key terms was used for the final analysis. RESULTS: Findings suggested that moral foundations play a role in the psychological processes underlying uncivil vaccine mandate discourse. Specifically, we found substantial associations between all moral foundations (ie, care and harm, fairness and cheating, loyalty and betrayal, authority and subversion, and sanctity and degradation) and dimensions of incivility (ie, toxicity, insults, profanity, threat, and identity attack) except for the authority foundation. We also found statistically significant differences between r/coronaviruscirclejerk and r/lockdownskepticism for the presence of the dimensions of incivility. Specifically, the mean of identity attack, insult, toxicity, profanity, and threat in the r/lockdownskepticism subreddit was significantly lower than that in the r/coronaviruscirclejerk subreddit (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that moral foundations may play a substantial role in the presence of incivility in vaccine discourse. On the basis of the findings of the study, public health practitioners should tailor messaging by addressing the moral values underlying the concerns people may have about vaccines, which could manifest as uncivil discourse. Another way to tailor public health messaging could be to direct it to parts of social media platforms with increased uncivil discourse. By integrating moral foundations, public health messaging may increase compliance and promote civil discourse surrounding COVID-19.",

Unfortunately, existing regression-based approaches are ill-suited to explore the complex combinations of demographic, policy, and political factors that produce swing voters in American elections. This gap between theory and practice motivates our use of an ensemble of supervised machine learning methods to predict swing voters in the 2012, 2016, and 2020 U.S. presidential elections. The results from the learning ensemble substantiate the existence of swing voters in contemporary American elections. Specifically, we demonstrate that the learning ensemble produces well-calibrated and externally valid predictions of swing voter propensity in later elections and for related behaviors such as split-ticket voting. Although interpreting black-box models is more challenging, they can nonetheless provide meaningful substantive insights meriting further exploration. Here, we use flexible model-agnostic tools to perturb the ensemble and demonstrate that cross-pressures (particularly those involving ideological and policy-related considerations) are essential to accurately predict swing voters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "Peer support specialists (PSs) have mental health recovery experience and are hired to assist others with similar challenges. This study is among the first to characterize stress among PSs, compared to data on other groups. Seven hundred and thirty-eight PSs working in U.S. mental health settings completed a cross-sectional online survey that included the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Participants' scores were compared with those obtained in prior samples of nonreferred adults and nonpeer clinicians. Comparisons are stratified by PSs' level of current symptoms, assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory. As a group, PSs experienced low to moderate levels of general and work-related stress. PSs endorsed modestly lower levels of general stress (d = -.25) than a normative sample of community residents. Although PSs endorsed lower levels of secondary trauma (d = -.15) than social workers and greater emotional exhaustion (d = .13) than nonpeer clinicians, effect sizes are \"smaller than small.\" A small subgroup (21.6%) of PSs with significant current symptoms experienced substantially greater general stress, secondary trauma, and emotional exhaustion than comparisons (d = 0.77, 1.04, and 1.12, respectively); despite having work conditions similar to other PSs respondents. Overall, PSs appear no more susceptible to general stress and work-related stress than relevant comparison groups of community residents and clinicians. A small subgroup of PSs experience both significant stress and symptoms-as is the case in other populations, given the well-established association between these constructs. Implications for supporting PSs and other clinicians with periods of work stress are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "Neuromusculoskeletal injuries including osteoarthritis, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury affect roughly 19% of the U.S. adult population. Standardized interventions have produced suboptimal functional outcomes due to the unique treatment needs of each patient. Strides have been made to utilize computational models to develop personalized treatments, but researchers and clinicians have yet to cross the \"valley of death\" between fundamental research and clinical usefulness. This article introduces the Neuromusculoskeletal Modeling (NMSM) Pipeline, two MATLAB-based toolsets that add Model Personalization and Treatment Optimization functionality to OpenSim. The two toolsets facilitate computational design of individualized treatments for neuromusculoskeletal impairments through the use of personalized neuromusculoskeletal models and predictive simulation. The Model Personalization toolset contains four tools for personalizing 1) joint structure models, 2) muscle-tendon models, 3) neural control models, and 4) foot-ground contact models. The Treatment Optimization toolset contains three tools for predicting and optimizing a patient's functional outcome for different treatment options using a patient's personalized neuromusculoskeletal model with direct collocation optimal control methods. Support for user-defined cost functions and model modification functions facilitate simulation of a vast number of possible treatments. An NMSM Pipeline use case is presented for an individual post-stroke with impaired walking function, where the goal was to predict how the subject's neural control could be changed to improve walking speed without increasing metabolic cost. First the Model Personalization toolset was used to develop a personalized neuromusculoskeletal model of the subject starting from a generic OpenSim full-body model and experimental walking data (video motion capture, ground reaction, and electromyography) collected from the subject at his self-selected speed. Next the Treatment Optimization toolset was used with the personalized model to predict how the subject could recruit existing muscle synergies more effectively to reduce muscle activation disparities between the paretic and non-paretic legs. The software predicted that the subject could increase his walking speed by 60% without increasing his metabolic cost per unit time by modifying existing muscle synergy recruitment. This hypothetical treatment demonstrates how NMSM Pipeline tools could allow researchers working collaboratively with clinicians to develop personalized neuromusculoskeletal models of individual patients and to perform predictive simulations for the purpose of designing personalized treatments that maximize a patient's post-treatment functional outcome.",

      "abstract": "In the early twentieth century, musicology was established as an academic discipline in the United States. Nonetheless, with the exception of Iberian medieval and Renaissance repertories, U.S. scholars largely overlooked the music of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world. Why should this have been the case, especially in light of Spain’s strong historical presence in the United States? This autobiographical essay examines this question by tracing the career of an individual musicologist, the Hispanist musicologist Carol A. Hess. Evaluated here are disciplinary shifts in U.S. musicology —methodological, philosophical, and ideological— over the past thirty years. These transformations have combined to make this repertory a viable field of study today. Musicologists in the United States can now make their careers by specializing in Iberian and Latin American music, as well as the music of the Hispanic diaspora. They research topics ranging from the avant-garde composer Llorenç Barber to the rapper Nach Scratch or the popular bandleader Xavier Cugat and his U.S. audiences of the 1940s, while others also pursue the time-tested areas of medieval and Renaissance music. Iberian and Latin American music is regularly offered in postsecondary institutions while instructors now have a variety of textbooks and other pedagogical resources from which to choose. All add up to a disciplinary freedom that would have been unthinkable only a few decades ago.",

METHODS: For motor/functional end points, 3 candidate gene variants (ApoE ε4, BDNF [brain-derived neurotrophic factor], and a dopamine polygenic score) were analyzed for associations with change in grip strength (3 months-baseline), function (3-month Stroke Impact Scale-Activities of Daily Living), mood (3-month Patient Health Questionnaire-8), and cognition (12-month telephone-Montreal Cognitive Assessment). For stress-related outcomes, 7 variants (serotonin transporter gene-linked promoter region, ACE [angiotensin-converting enzyme], oxytocin receptor, FKBP5 [FKBP prolyl isomerase 5], FAAH [fatty acid amide hydrolase], BDNF, and COMT [catechol-O-methyltransferase]) were assessed for associations with posttraumatic stress disorder ([PTSD]; PTSD Primary Care Scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8) at 6 and 12 months; stress-related genes were examined as a function of poststroke stress level. Statistical models (linear, negative binomial, or Poisson regression) were based on response variable distribution; all included stroke severity, age, sex, and ancestry as covariates. Stroke subtype was explored secondarily. Data were Holm-Bonferroni corrected. A secondary replication analysis tested whether the rs1842681 polymorphism (identified in the GISCOME study [Genetics of Ischaemic Stroke Functional Outcome]) was related to 3-month modified Rankin Scale score in STRONG. RESULTS: The 763 enrollees were 63.1±14.9 (mean±SD) years of age, with a median initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 4 (interquartile range, 2-9); outcome data were available in n=515 at 3 months, n=500 at 6 months, and n=489 at 12 months. At 1 year poststroke, the rs6265 (BDNF) variant was associated with poorer cognition (0.9-point lower telephone-Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, P=1×10-5). For stress-related outcomes, rs4291 (ACE) and rs324420 (FAAH) were risk factors linking increased poststroke stress with higher 1-year depression and PTSD symptoms (P<0.05), while rs4680 (COMT) linked poststroke stress with lower 1-year depression and PTSD. Findings were unchanged when considering stroke subtype. STRONG replicated GISCOME: rs1842681 was associated with lower 3-month modified Rankin Scale score (P=3.2×10-5). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified genetic associations with cognitive function, depression, and PTSD 1 year poststroke. Genetic susceptibility to PTSD and depressive symptoms varied according to the amount of poststroke stress, underscoring the critical role of lived experiences in recovery. Together, the results suggest that genetic association studies provide insights into the biology of stroke recovery in humans.",

      "abstract": "Uncertainty surrounding if the U.S. will implement a federal climate policy introduces risk into the decision to invest in long-lived capital assets, particularly those designed to use, or to replace fossil fuel. We develop a dynamic, general equilibrium model to quantify the macroeconomic impacts of this climate policy transition risk. The model incorporates beliefs over the likelihood that the government adopts a climate policy causing the economy to dynamically transition to a lower carbon steady state. We find that climate policy transition risk decreases carbon emissions today by causing investment to become relatively cleaner and output to fall. This result counters the Green Paradox, which argues that climate policy risk raises emissions today by increasing incentives to extract fossil fuel, expanding its supply. Even allowing for the supply-side response, we find the demand-side response dominates, and the net effect of climate policy transition risk is still to reduce emissions today.",

      "abstract": "Context: Health plan disenrollment has been associated with higher mortality in patients with opioid use disorder. Insurance loss and health plan disenrollment might be downstream social consequences of opioid misuse and overdose that may heighten patient mortality risks during a period of heightened need for professional assistance. Objective: To test hypotheses that: 1) overdose events in patients prescribed long-term opioids are associated with subsequent health plan disenrollment; and 2) buprenorphine initiation after overdose would attenuate this association. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Dataset: Data from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse which includes de-identified medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment records for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees. The database contains longitudinal health information on patients, representing a mixture of ages, ethnicities, and geographical regions across the United States. Population studied: Adults (aged ≥18 years) prescribed stable, opioid therapy for a 6-month baseline period (≥90% of days covered, <10% monthly fluctuation from 6-month average, average daily dose ≥10 morphine milligram equivalents). Outcome Measures: Health plan disenrollment during up to one year of follow-up. Negative binomial regression estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios of disenrollment by incident overdose and buprenorphine initiation after overdose. Results: We identified 556,676 patients who were followed up after 1,119,100 stable periods of opioid therapy. During follow-up, 17.5% of person-periods ended in health plan disenrollment. Overdose events during follow-up were associated with health plan disenrollment with a dose-response relationship [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) for 1 overdose event = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24-1.35); aIRR for ≥2 overdose events = 1.51 (1.43-1.59)]. Among patients with overdose events, subsequent buprenorphine initiation was associated with substantially reduced risk of health plan disenrollment [aIRR 0.36 (0.17-0.74)]. Conclusions: Overdose events in patients prescribed long-term opioids may portend other social consequences, such as health insurance loss, which may exacerbate patient risk at a time of heightened need and vulnerability. Buprenorphine may mitigate the risk of health plan disenrollment in opioid-prescribed patients who overdose.",

In the Snake River, a highly altered river-reservoir system in the semi-arid western United States, OM production and loading are key drivers of reservoir anoxia, which leads to several deleterious processes such as mercury methylation. However, sources and quantities of OM to the Snake River, and the effects of impoundment on OM moving through the river-reservoir system, are not well understood. Particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate nitrogen (PN), chlorophyll a (chl-a), and δ15N–PN and δ13C–POC isotopic ratios were measured bi-weekly for over 2 years at four locations through the Snake River Hells Canyon Reservoir Complex to determine spatial and temporal patterns of OM quantities and sources. POC concentrations increased through the riverine zone upstream of the reservoirs, likely due to in situ primary production and/or inputs from tributaries and agricultural drains; then decreased through the most upstream reservoir likely due to particle settling. Isotopic ratios and other OM source indicators (δ15N–PN, δ13C–POC, POC:PN, chl-a:POC) show that the dominant source of particulate OM was phytoplankton with seasonal terrestrial/macrophytic inputs. Results highlight the effects of major tributary and agricultural drain inputs, primary production, and impoundment on OM composition and concentration through a large river-reservoir system and may inform water quality management efforts in this and similar systems.",

Yet dominant violence prevention narratives too often ignore or deemphasize the deeply intertwined threads of structural violence with other forms of violence, leading to policies and practices that are frequently insufficient, and often harmful, for reducing interpersonal firearm violence and building community safety, particularly in minoritized and structurally marginalized communities. We highlight ways in which limited scrutiny of structural violence, the omission of its defining characteristics-power and deprivation-from functional characterizations and frameworks of interpersonal firearm violence, and the inadequate distribution of power and resources to those most impacted by violence to self-determine narratives of and solutions to interpersonal firearm violence grossly impacts how interpersonal firearm violence is collectively conceived, discussed, and addressed. Expanding dominant narratives of interpersonal firearm violence, guided by the wisdom and determination of those most impacted, such that the goal of prevention and intervention efforts is not merely the absence of violence but rather the creation of a community safety and health ecosystem is essential to meet this critical moment in firearm violence research and prevention.",

      "abstract": "With vegetable consumption in the US significantly lower than that recommended by nutritionists, and growers facing increasing production challenges, a survey of carrot stakeholders was conducted to develop a plan for addressing these challenges as they pertain to carrot. The survey revealed that the carrot industry needs breeding stocks and genomic tools to develop carrots with improved field performance, including disease and pest resistance and abiotic stress tolerance, to meet growing market demands; and improved flavor and nutritional quality to better meet consumer needs. To address these needs, the carrot Specialty Crops Research Initiative (SCRI) Project was proposed and funded by the USDA-NIFA. We have screened the national germplasm collection of around 700 diverse cultivated carrot accessions and identified new sources of traits for improving carrot productivity and quality, expanding product development, and strengthening economic viability. Improved cultivars with these traits will provide a cost-effective, environmentally favorable means to deliver an improved carrot crop to growers, processors, and consumers. However, carrot breeders need tools to track genes for improving the crop, and will need tested breeding stocks to develop superior cultivars more efficiently. The goals of this project are to: 1) develop cost-effective genomic tools to advance carrot breeding populations with the economically and nutritionally significant traits identified by stakeholders; 2) map genes underlying economically important traits so breeders can effectively deploy these traits in cultivars for growers, processors, and consumers; 3) evaluate bioavailability of nutrients in carrots with varying nutrient composition that may influence nutritional impact; and 4) evaluate the market value and impact of carrot traits on grower and consumer decisions.",

Time spent alone showed linear increases from 7th to 12th grade, with greater increases in time spent alone in high school for youth who spent a high proportion of time alone at the start of high school (9th grade). Greater time spent alone in 9th grade was significantly predicted by gender, lower peer relationship quality, parent-child support, parental warmth, higher parent-child conflict, parental hostility, and youth neuroticism. However, there were no significant predictors of change in time spent alone throughout the course of high school (from 9th to 12th grade). Lastly, loneliness in young adulthood was predicted by spending a high proportion of time alone, higher neuroticism, and lower extraversion in the 9th grade. Thus, time spent alone in adolescence may be a crucial early indicator of later loneliness.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Smokeless tobacco use remains prevalent in rural and medically underserved populations, leading to increased rates of tobacco-related cancers and chronic disease. While access to effective cessation programs is limited, text-based interventions may offer a delivery approach with broad reach. This two-armed randomized control trial (RCT) assessed the efficacy of #EnufSnuff.TXT, a text-based smokeless tobacco cessation intervention, in rural and medically underserved communities. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted a two-arm RCT assessing #EnufSnuff.TXT, a text-based scheduled reduction intervention paired with text-based cessation support messages compared with the modified Enough Snuff intervention comprised of a cessation education booklet and bi-weekly motivational text messages. We recruited participants via social media and surveyed participants at 3 and 6 months post-randomization. The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months. RESULTS: We recruited and randomized 532 participants. At 3 months post-randomization, the quit rate was significantly higher in #EnufSnuff.TXT arm compared to the Enough Snuff arm for intent-to-treat (ITT) cases (29.2% vs. 19.0%, odd ratios [OR] = 1.75, p = .0066). The quit rate at 6 months post-randomization remained higher in #EnufSNuff.TXT compared to Enough Snuff for ITT cases (23.1% vs. 20.9%, OR = 1.14, p = .5384), although no longer significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale text-based cessation clinical trial for individuals in underserved areas who use smokeless tobacco. The #EnufSnuff.TXT intervention performed better in the short term; however, both interventions yielded similar quit rates at 6 months post-randomization. Future research should focus on improving long-term abstinence in the #EnufSNuff.TXT intervention. IMPLICATIONS: Text-based cessation approaches have the potential to increase access to cessation interventions in rural and medically underserved areas and reduce tobacco-related chronic disease morbidity and mortality. Our study shows short-term efficacy from the first-ever randomized controlled trial of a smokeless tobacco cessation intervention, #EnufSnuff.TXT, for rural and medically underserved residents in the United States. Our #EnufSnuff.TXT Intervention offers a scalable solution to reach and provide much-needed access to cessation interventions in medically underserved, rural communities in the United States. This work provides the foundation for further inquiry on augmented text-based approaches to increase cessation in this at-risk group.

Overall, participants produced more effortful speech when talking to a device (longer duration and higher pitch). These differences also varied by age: children produced even higher pitch in device-directed speech, suggesting a stronger expectation to be misunderstood by the system. In support of this, we see that after a staged recognition error by the device, children increased pitch even more. Furthermore, both adults and children displayed the same degree of variation in their responses for whether \"Alexa seems like a real person or not\", further indicating that children's conceptualization of the system's competence shaped their register adjustments, rather than an increased anthropomorphism response. This work speaks to models on the mechanisms underlying speech production, and human-computer interaction frameworks, providing support for routinized theories of spoken interaction with technology.",

This could trigger more alerts telling people to stay inside to protect themselves, with potential consequences for health and health equity. Here, we study the change in US air quality alerts over this century due to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), who they may affect, and how they may respond. We find air quality alerts increase by over 1 mo per year in the eastern United States by 2100 and quadruple on average. They predominantly affect areas with high Black populations and leakier homes, exacerbating existing inequalities and impacting those less able to adapt. Reducing emissions can offer significant annual health benefits ($5,400 per person) by mitigating the effect of climate change on air pollution and its associated risks of early death. Relying on people to adapt, instead, would require them to stay inside, with doors and windows closed, for an extra 142 d per year, at an average cost of $11,000 per person. It appears likelier, however, that people will achieve minimal protection without policy to increase adaptation rates. Boosting adaptation can offer net benefits, even alongside deep emission cuts. New adaptation policies could, for example: reduce adaptation costs; reduce infiltration and improve indoor air quality; increase awareness of alerts and adaptation; and provide measures for those working or living outdoors. Reducing emissions, conversely, lowers everyone's need to adapt, and protects those who cannot adapt. Equitably protecting human health from air pollution under climate change requires both mitigation and adaptation.",

The escalating cost of drug discovery is a major motivating factor for seeking new methods to predict the safety and efficacy of new compounds as early as possible in the drug development process to avoid drug attrition during late phases of clinical trials or even the withdrawal of approved drugs. Cardiotoxicity accounts for nearly 30% of US post-marketing drug withdrawal and remains a major concern to the point where the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is focused on in vitro cardiotoxicity screening to minimize cardiac risks associated with drugs. A technique that can directly quantify interactions between drugs and cardiomyocytes without the interference from exogenous genetic or chemical labels would be highly beneficial for directly screening these new drugs. Our group has previously shown that second harmonic generation (SHG) signals generated from myosin filaments in cardiomyocytes can be used as a robust label-free optical technique for recording cell shortening dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution due to the ability of the myosin rod domains in heart muscle cells to emit the frequency-doubled light. The dynamics is recorded without adding any fluorescent labels that may otherwise affect and modify the natural cell contractility of the cell. In this study, we investigated the use of SHG microscopy for measuring drug-induced changes in cardiac cell contractility and discuss its feasibility as a tool for screening drugs and evaluating cardiotoxicity.",

The two treatments rely on a higherintensity, ex-ante approach to moderating misinformation on the platform relative to the control, which relies on a more standard ex-post approach to moderation. In one treatment, no misinformation was allowed on the platform, while in the other, it was allowed with an official rebuttal. Controlling misinformation, as in the treatments, reduces platform usage by 41%, indicating a distaste for moderation. Furthermore, the treatments reduce exposure to official information by 29% more than they reduce exposure to misinformation. A conceptual framework posits that these findings can be explained by the fact that, in this setting, official information is more trusted, and thus is more widely disseminated, relative to misinformation. We find evidence for two potential mechanisms for the observed distaste for moderation.",

Multi-omics approaches, while promising, are high in cost and complexity, low throughput, slow, and require large sample volumes, thus are impractical for many stages of clinical care. Raman spectroscopy (RS) addresses many of these needs: it requires little to no sample preparation, is non-destructive, does not need exogenous dyes or labelling agents, and can be performed directly in aqueous solutions. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers further improvements in terms of sensitivity but increases complexity. In this study we carried out comprehensive RS and SERS measurements on a &amp;gt;100-person cohort of blood and saliva from head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and benign controls. Analyses were carried out on whole biofluids, in addition to extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from the biofluids to investigate the added value. EVs are emerging biomarkers of interest found in high numbers in circulating biofluids with great promise to increase the specificity of diagnostic platforms.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: We analyzed a robust clinical dataset of HNC patient saliva and plasma to build a diagnostic model.

      "abstract": "Bats have evolved behavioral specializations that are unique among mammals, including self-propelled flight and echolocation. However, areas of motor cortex that are critical in the generation and fine control of these unique behaviors have never been fully characterized in any bat species, despite the fact that bats compose ∼25% of extant mammalian species. Using intracortical microstimulation, we examined the organization of motor cortex in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a species that has evolved a novel form of tongue-based echolocation.1,2 We found that movement representations include an enlarged tongue region containing discrete subregions devoted to generating distinct tongue movement types, consistent with their behavioral specialization generating active sonar using tongue clicks. This magnification of the tongue in motor cortex is comparable to the enlargement of somatosensory representations in species with sensory specializations.3-5 We also found a novel degree of coactivation between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, both of which are involved in altering the shape and tension of wing membranes during flight. Together, these findings suggest that the organization of motor cortex has coevolved with peripheral morphology in bats to support the unique motor demands of flight and echolocation.",

Moreover, Florida peach acreage has increased 8.5-fold in the past 10 years. Using a conjoint-based experimental design and analysis, we measured U.S. consumer reactions to diverse groups of ideas describing peaches, including production regions, and identified attributes that positively and negatively influence consumer preference. The main objective of this research was to identify external and internal attributes that make the “ideal peach.” Are consumers willing to pay more for a locally grown peach? Will consumers prefer a Florida peach instead of a Georgia or California peach? The top three peach attributes identified were “juicy and fully ripe,” “strong peach aroma and sweet peach taste,” and “grown in Georgia.” Cluster analysis revealed two segments of consumers: consumers in the first segment focused on physical aspects of the peach, and consumers in the second segment were concerned with peach production regions and health benefits. The findings from this research will be helpful in developing marketing programs for Florida peaches as an item that is perfect for snacking because of their small size and desirable texture and flavor.",

      "abstract": "Low-chill peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] cultivars allow Florida growers to become competitive by offering fruits earlier than northern states for premium prices. Due to the predominance of sandy soils in Florida, irrigation is required to ensure fruit production in peaches. Available irrigation recommendations and peach crop coefficients (Kc) were determined in Mediterranean and temperate climates, and they can overestimate water demand in humid subtropical climates. Thus, a two-year study was conducted in Citra, FL, aiming to determine the water requirements and Kc values for four-year-old peach trees in humid subtropical conditions. A daily soil water balance and the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was determined using soil volumetric water content recorded every 10 min. Five soil probes, each equipped with soil moisture sensors at 10, 20, 40, and 80 cm of soil depth representing soil depth layers of 0–15, 15–30, 30–60, and 60–90 cm, respectively placed under the tree canopy. The ratios of daily ETc and Penman-Monteith FAO-56 reference evapotranspiration were used to estimate Kc for phenological stages of adult (≥4-year-old) peach trees. A soil water depletion coefficient (Ks) was estimated obtaining a threshold of 25.8 % available soil water depletion before trees undergo water stress. Daily ETc ranged from 0.22 mm d−1 during dormancy to 3.65 mm d−1 during shoot development. Values of Kc for peach trees ranged from 0.30 during dormancy to 0.69 during fruit maturity. The use of peach tree Kc adapted for subtropical humid conditions reduce the estimated crop water requirements by 21 % compared to the Kc values reported in FAO-56 guidelines.",

The lack of surveillance programs has led to low rates of diagnosis and treatment, particularly in rural areas. We conducted mobile HBV-HCC screening clinics in rural Tanzania between March 2021 and February 2023. After undergoing informed consent, patients completed a questionnaire about HBV. A rapid point-of-care (POC) assay measured HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and HBsAg-positive patients underwent POC ultrasound to screen for HCC and POC hepatitis C (HCV) antibody testing. The primary outcome was number of HBV diagnoses, and the secondary outcome was prevalence of liver masses in HBsAg-positive individuals. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Five hundred and one patients were screened for HBV; 63% (n = 303) were female with median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 40 (28-55) years. Only 6% (n = 30) reported being vaccinated against HBV, 92% (n = 453) reported no vaccination, and 2% (n = 12) did not know their vaccination status. Seventy-six percent (n = 340) did not know they should get vaccinated, and 4% (n = 16) reported that vaccination was too expensive. Two percent (n = 11) of patients were positive for HBsAg, with 55% (n = 6) of those being female with median (IQR) age of 36 (34-43) years. None of the HBsAg-positive patients reported being vaccinated against HBV, and all were negative for HCV. On ultrasound, one patient had a liver mass, and another had ascites. We demonstrated that community-based HBV and HCC screening can be implemented in Africa with local partnerships, and this model could be used to promote awareness and improve early detection of disease.",

OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of complications associated with MRI performed under general anaesthesia at a large referral facility and evaluate potential risk factors for these complications. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. METHODS: Patient information and details of the MRI procedure were collected retrospectively from medical records of all horses that had undergone an MRI under general anaesthesia at the University of Pennsylvania, New Bolton Center, between September 2005 and April 2012. Complications and categorical variables were examined by chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. A mixed-effects logistic regression approach was used to evaluate associations between explanatory variables and the outcome variable (complications or pyrexia). A univariable screen was used to select variables (likelihood ratio test p < 0.2) for inclusion in the multivariable analysis. Statistical significance was inferred when p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Complications were noted after MRI in 51 (17.4%) of 293 events eligible for inclusion. Complications included pyrexia (n = 35), pneumonia (n = 14), colic (n = 10), facial/nerve paralysis (n = 6), diarrhoea (n = 4), and other (n = 3). The odds of developing a post-anaesthetic complication were significantly decreased in horses that received peri-anaesthetic antimicrobials (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14-0.63, p = 0.002). Increased age (OR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.76-0.99, p = 0.03) and peri-anaesthetic antimicrobial administration (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.65, p = 0.005) were associated with a decreased odds of developing pyrexia. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Single centre retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: Potential complications including pyrexia, pneumonia and colic should be recognised when pursuing MRI under general anaesthesia. The administration of peri-anaesthetic antimicrobials decreased the odds of a complication and warrants consideration, particularly in horses that might be classified as high risk.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid poplar has potential as feedstock for the production of bioenergy and bio-based products. Planning effective placement of hybrid poplar based biorefinery facilities takes tremendous time and financial resources. A hybrid poplar based biorefinery siting application (HP-BiSWA), a web-enabled refinery siting application, was developed so that potential stakeholders may quickly assess available resources at selected locations and provide information relating to the economic competitiveness and financial risks associated with construction and operation. At present, the tool supports evaluation of the potential for hybrid poplar based jet fuel and acetic acid production based on user-specified conditions. The application is generally expandable to other feedstock, technology, and product types. HP-BiSWA uses various modules (i.e. 3PG-crop growth model and farm budget application) and services (i.e. parcel service, transportation routing service, crop service, soil and weather services) to retrieve and estimate information to optimize and select potential parcels for poplar cultivation, and ultimately determine net revenue for biofuel production under selected decision options. To demonstrate the utility of HP-BiSWA, a case study analysis was performed for Centralia, WA based on a 380 ML/yr (100 MGY) jet fuel biorefinery using two scenarios: (1) a 175 km feedstock supply radius with 50% pastureland use, and (2) a 225 km feedstock supply radius with 25% pastureland use. The case study captures the interactive effects on biorefinery performance with changes in feedstock supply area and available water, power, and other resources for operation of the biorefinery.",

Depressive symptoms may precede alcohol use, via the self-medication pathway, or alcohol use may precede depressive symptoms, via the alcohol induced disruption pathway. Yet little is known about other risks for developing comorbidity via either path. The present study hypothesized that poor cognitive and physiological emotion regulation (ER) are risk factors implicated in the development of comorbid depression and alcohol use during late adolescence. Participants were 229 (113 girls) Mexican-origin youth who reported on depressive symptoms and alcohol use at ages 17 (Time 1) and 19 years (Time 2). At age 17, cognitive reappraisal (CR), an adaptive ER strategy, and baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a physiological index of ER capacity, were assessed. CR, RSA and gender were examined as predictors and moderators of the developing comorbidity of alcohol use and depression in cross-lagged panel models. Lower use of CR was concurrently associated with more depressive symptoms at age 17 and predicted greater depression at age 19. Age 17 alcohol use predicted age 19 depressive symptoms for boys. Lower RSA at age 17 also predicted more depressive symptoms at age 19 for boys. Neither CR nor RSA moderated the predicted relations between depression and alcohol use. Findings supported the alcohol induced disruption model of comorbidity for boys, and showed that poor cognitive and physiological ER increased risk for exacerbating depressive symptoms in late adolescence.",

      "abstract": "A persistent lack of juvenile recruitment in populations of the imperiled Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) has been attributed to artificially inflated populations of coyotes (Canis latrans) and common ravens (Corvus corax) in some areas. Subsidized by resources in the form of road-killed prey, movement corridors, or nesting perches provided by ever-expanding road and powerline networks, these “subsidized predators” threaten tortoises and other species thanks to subsidies that help support their populations in areas where they might otherwise have been less abundant. Here, we quantified the risk of predation from these subsidized predators on juvenile Mojave desert tortoises by quantifying attack rates on 3D-printed replicas. We evaluated predation risk as a function of replica size, distance from powerlines, and season—variables that can inform release strategies of head-started and translocated tortoises. We found significantly greater risk of predation from ravens in the spring than in the fall. Replica size did not significantly influence predation risk from ravens or coyotes. Replica distance from a powerline or road also did not significantly influence predation risk, supporting previous studies that have found the risk of predation can persist for up to 1.6 km from raven nesting structures. Our results support recommendations for releasing juvenile head-started and translocated tortoises in the fall and away from areas close to raven nesting structures. Our study provides insight into the interactions of prey and subsidized predators and helps guide management on potential mitigation strategies for minimizing the impacts of subsidized predators on species like the imperiled Mojave desert tortoise.",

Head-starting—the raising of juveniles to larger sizes to improve survival—is one tool that can be used in circumstances where juvenile recruitment is limited. Due to declining populations and difficulty detecting juveniles, however, lack of knowledge of the ecology of juveniles can hinder efforts to develop and evaluate head-starting programs for many turtle species. We sought to inform recovery efforts of Mojave desert tortoises by quantifying multi-year space use and survival of head-started juveniles after release. We radio-tracked tortoises head-started under three different husbandry treatments that varied in rearing duration (from two to over six years) and whether head-starting included an indoor rearing component the first year. We compared post-release space use and survival as a function of treatment, release size, and time since release. We found that space use, including home range size and site fidelity, varied by husbandry treatment, with smaller and younger tortoises having smaller home ranges and higher site fidelity. Additionally, home range size decreased and site fidelity increased with time since release across treatments. Tortoises with an indoor-rearing component experiencing increased risk of mortality as movement increased compared to tortoises reared solely outdoors. Nevertheless, survival did not differ among treatments or with tortoise age or size. Regardless of husbandry treatment, head-started tortoises exhibited similar space-use and survival overall. Our study provides insight into juvenile tortoise behavior and head-starting as a tool for tortoise conservation.",

The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between destemming force and fruit width, fruit length, and pericarp thickness, along with the genetic potential for combining the easy‐destemming attribute with the preferred fruit morphology of New Mexico (NM) pod‐type green chile. This investigation will define optimal selection criteria for reducing destemming force, while preserving the distinctive morphology of NM pod‐type green chile. We quantified phenotypic and genetic variation of 285 F<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> families from three populations developed from reciprocal crosses between three NM pod‐type cultivars and an easy‐destemming cultivar. The results show destemming force exhibited significant positive phenotypic correlations with pericarp thickness and fruit width (0.90 and 0.92, respectively) and fruit length (0.69). Genetic correlations for each of the three populations for fruit morphological traits ranged from 0.2 to 0.9, with pericarp thickness with the highest genetic correlation with destemming force. Narrow‐sense heritability values were between 0.2 and 0.8, with destemming force and fruit length consistently having higher narrow‐sense heritability values. These findings suggest a correlation between the expression of pericarp thickness and destemming force. The lower estimates for pericarp thickness indicate environmental influences may play a more significant role in determining trait expression. The information generated from this study will aid in the development of efficient cultivars suited for mechanical harvesting in NM pod‐type breeding programs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "The organochlorine pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is an endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC) that has been banned by most countries for decades. However, it continues to be detected in nearly all humans and wildlife due to its biological and environmental persistence. The ovarian dysgenesis syndrome hypothesis speculates that exposure to EDCs during sensitive developmental windows such as early gonadal differentiation lead to reproductive disorders later in life. Yet, mechanisms by which DDT affects developing gonads remain unclear due to the inherent challenge of getting developmental exposure data from adults presenting with reproductive disease. The Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a valuable fish model for sex-specific toxicological studies due to its chromosomal sex determination, external embryonic development, short generation time, and extensively mapped genome. It is well documented that medaka exposed to DDT and its metabolites and byproducts (herein referred to as DDT+) at different developmental time points experience permanent alterations in gonadal morphology, reproductive success, and molecular and hormonal signaling. However, the overwhelming majority of studies focus primarily on functional and morphological outcomes in males and females and have rarely investigated long-term transcriptional or molecular effects. This review summarizes previous experimental findings and the state of our knowledge concerning toxic effects DDT + on reproductive development, fertility, and health in the valuable medaka model. It also identifies gaps in knowledge, emphasizing a need for more focus on molecular mechanisms of ovarian endocrine disruption using enhanced molecular tools that have become increasingly available over the past few decades. Furthermore, DDT forms a myriad of over 45 metabolites and transformation products in biota and the environment, very few of which have been evaluated for environmental abundance or health effects. This reinforces the demand for high throughput and economical in vivo models for predictive toxicology screening, and the Japanese medaka is uniquely positioned to meet this need.",

      "abstract": "Previous research suggests that ideology, material interests, and moral values drive citizens’ preferences over foreign aid policy. Little attention has been paid to how perceptions of the international environment affect these preferences. We examine the extent to which citizens in a traditional donor country consider donor competition when deciding whether to impose aid sanctions on governments engaged in human rights violations. Employing an information experiment conducted among Japanese adults, we find that the prospect of another donor ready to act as a substitute aid-provider reduces support for the use of aid sanctions. This effect runs most strongly through a pathway privileging security concerns, and the effect is larger among respondents who have preexisting concerns about the other donor. These results highlight the way in which public desires for foreign aid to bring about material returns can hinder a government’s ability to use aid to promote good governance ends.",

For annual plants that already live in an extreme environment like the Sonoran Desert, keeping a fraction of their seeds dormant underground (for possibly years at a time) is critical to survive. Here, we consider how this form of bet hedging (i.e., delayed germination) for 10 Sonoran Desert annuals mediates responses to precipitation shifts. We use a demographic model parameterized with long-term field and precipitation data to explore how forecasted changes in precipitation impact annual plant species' population densities. We then examine how instantaneous evolution of optimal germination fractions in the shifted precipitation regimes bolsters population densities. Our results indicate that overall less rainfall and, to a lesser extent, increased variance in rainfall drive population levels down. Instantaneous evolution of optimal germination fractions in new regimes benefited species' populations only marginally, and only for small to moderate shifts in precipitation. Thus, even rapid evolution is unlikely to save populations experiencing larger shifts in precipitation. Finally, we predict that specialists that can capitalize on wet-year bonanzas or are water use efficient will be the most resilient to precipitation shifts as long as their seed survivorships are sufficiently high.",

      "abstract": "During the 3rd millennium BC, a series of oases located along the western foothills of the al-Hajar Mountains saw the establishment of intensive human occupation, associated with the construction of large buildings (the so-called “towers”) and residential structures. These settlements were supported by the onset of agriculture and their development was often associated with and made possible by the introduction of substantial water management systems, including simple wells and complex, large ditches. The oasis of Salūt, near Bisya in the central Sultanate of Oman, is one such Early Bronze Age (EBA) centre. There, extensive investigation of ancient hydraulic structures provided an opportunity to study contexts preserving significant information on ancient climate change and water availability, from the late 3rd to the second half of the 1st millennium BC. A geoarchaeological investigation targeted the huge ditch surrounding the EBA stone tower of Salūt-ST1. Its complete layout was revealed and large portions were fully excavated, allowing the documentation of its infillings and the geological substratum. At the same time, wells excavated at the bottom of the ditch witness the attempt to cope with the lowering water table at the turn of the 3rd millennium BC. Exploration of Iron Age (IA) wells, paired with the geoarchaeological study of sediments from the plain, further extended the chronological scope of the research, while a survey of the area identified ancient and more recent underground and open-air channels, including the exceptional radiometric dating for the introduction of the aflaj (the local term – plural – for the underground water tunnels) network serving the oasis in the late Holocene. This contribution presents the first synthesis including fresh data on how water was harvested and managed in the area of Salūt over almost two millennia, with a diachronic approach that finds little parallels in the region.",

We investigate the ionizing properties and star formation histories of star-forming dwarf galaxies at the last stages of EoR at 4.8 < z < 7 using observations from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The magnification due to gravitational lensing allows us to probe large dynamic ranges in stellar mass (2 × 106 ≤ M∗/M ≤ 5 × 109) and ultraviolet (UV) magnitudes (−22.68 ≤ MUV ≤= −15.95). We find a median UV slope β1500 of −2.56 ± 0.23 and the production efficiency of ionizing photons logξion = 25.39 ± 0.6 for the full sample (4.8 < z < 7) with a median stellar mass of 6.3 ± 0.5 × 107 M. We find both β1500 and ξion are marginally correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, indicating a possible greater contribution of dwarf galaxies to the reionization of the Universe. We find that on average, galaxies in our sample are experiencing a recent rise/burst of star formation which translates to a higher scatter in ξion and a large scatter in Hα equivalent widths (EWs). Finally, we investigate the trends of Hα and [O III] + Hβ EWs with UV magnitude and find MUV is correlated between Hα but not with [O III] + Hβ EWs indicating low metallicities and recent burst in the UV faint galaxies.",

This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, the existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures; each focuses on a different aspect of data, such as spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovative approaches called Multi Foundation Quake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California. Earthquake time series are generated using the logarithm energy released by quakes, spanning 1986 to 2024. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a novel method, Multi Foundation Quake, that achieves the best overall performance by combining a bespoke pattern with Foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams.",

We used mixed effects regression models to assess disease patterns at the individual and population levels. Pathogen infection/exposure prevalence varied both spatially and temporally. Our findings indicate that the primary predictor of individual pathogen infection/exposure was the region in which an animal was captured, implying that transmission is driven by local ecological or behavioral factors. Higher Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae seropositivity was associated with lower lamb survival, consistent with lambs having high rates of pneumonia-associated mortality, which may be slowing population recovery. There was no association between M. ovipneumoniae and adult survival. Adult survival was positively associated with population size and parainfluenza-3 virus seroprevalence in the same year, and orf virus seroprevalence in the previous year. Peninsular bighorn sheep are recovering from small population sizes in a habitat of environmental extremes, compounded by infectious disease.

Native turtles are among the species eaten by bullfrogs, and turtle populations are slow to recover from this impact. We examined the effects of bullfrogs and their removal on Northwestern pond turtles (Actinemys marmorata) at four sites in Yosemite National Park. From 2016 to 2022, we monitored turtle populations in two sites where bullfrogs were present and two where they have been absent. We removed 12,317 bullfrogs, larvae, and whole egg masses from one site and 4067 from the other, reaching near complete eradication by 2019. We captured just large adult turtles where bullfrogs were present compared with all sizes where bullfrogs were absent. Prior to near complete eradication, juvenile turtles were only found with bullfrogs when they were recovered from bullfrog stomachs. Turtles at bullfrog present sites were 26–36 % larger and 76–97 % heavier than turtles from bullfrog absent sites. Turtle abundance and densities were also 2–100 times higher at bullfrog absent sites. We captured the first juvenile turtles at bullfrog present sites only after reaching near complete bullfrog eradication in 2019. Altogether, our study shows a prolonged lack of juvenile turtle recruitment where bullfrogs were present but offers hope that bullfrog control may succeed in recovering turtle populations by easing predation pressure on hatchlings and juveniles. Our results indicate that bullfrog eradication efforts may be necessary to ensure persistence of at-risk species like native turtles.",

Previous research has documented substantial barriers, especially among vulnerable patient subgroups such as those with lower socioeconomic status or limited health literacy (LHL). We tested the effectiveness of delivering online, video-based portal training to patients in a safety net setting. METHODS: We created an online video curriculum about accessing the San Francisco Health Network portal, and then randomized 93 English-speaking patients with 1+ chronic diseases to receive 1) an in-person tutorial with a research assistant, or 2) a link to view the videos on their own. We also examined a third, nonrandomized usual care comparison group. The primary outcome was portal log-in (yes/no) 3 to 6 months post-training, assessed via the electronic health record. Secondary outcomes were self-reported attitudes and skills collected via baseline and follow-up surveys. RESULTS: Mean age was 54 years, 51% had LHL, 60% were nonwhite, 52% were female, 45% reported fair/poor health, and 76% reported daily Internet use. At followup, 21% logged into the portal, with no differences by arm (P = .41), but this was higher than the overall clinic rate of 9% (P < .01) during the same time period. We found significant prepost improvements in self-rated portal skills (P = .03) and eHealth literacy (P < .01). Those with LHL were less likely to log in post-training (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both modalities of online training were comparable, and neither mode enabled a majority of vulnerable patients to use portals, especially those with LHL. This suggests that portal training will need to be more intensive or portals need improved usability to meaningfully increase use among diverse patients.",

      "abstract": "In the past decade, studies have demonstrated that urban and nonurban wildlife populations exhibit differences in foraging behavior and diet. However, little is known about how environmental heterogeneity shapes dietary variation of organisms within cities. We examined the vertebrate prey components of diets of coyotes (Canis latrans) in San Francisco to quantify territory- and individual-level dietary differences and determine how within-city variation in land cover and land use affects coyote diet. We genotyped fecal samples for individual coyote identification and used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition and individual niche differentiation. The highest contributor to coyote diet overall was anthropogenic food followed by small mammals. The most frequently detected species were domestic chicken, pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), domestic pig, and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Diet composition varied significantly across territories and among individuals, with territories explaining most of the variation. Within territories (i.e., family groups), the amount of dietary variation attributed to among-individual differences increased with green space and decreased with impervious surface cover. The quantity of anthropogenic food in scats also was positively correlated with impervious surface cover, suggesting that coyotes consumed more human food in more urbanized territories. The quantity of invasive, human-commensal rodents in the diet was positively correlated with the number of food services in a territory. Overall, our results revealed substantial intraspecific variation in coyote diet associated with urban landscape heterogeneity and point to a diversifying effect of urbanization on population diet.",

      "abstract": "Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) populations in some regions have declined by >50% since 2004, prompting the need for more research on ways to recover populations. One possible recovery tool is head-starting (i.e., the act of protecting and raising juvenile tortoises to sizes that increase survival upon release); however, head-starting can have high start-up and maintenance costs that can limit its feasibility. Strategies that reduce cost and rearing duration may foster broader and more effective use. We released and radio-tracked 60 juvenile tortoises in the Mojave National Preserve in California, USA, that had been reared under 2 treatments: those reared 1 year indoors after hatching, then 1 year outdoors (combo) and those reared just 1 year indoors (indoor-only). We tested whether indoor-only rearing alone could be a more efficient means of producing robust head-started tortoises. We examined the behavior, movement, and survival of tortoises after release into the wild from 2020 to 2021 to determine whether these outcomes differed between husbandry treatments. Combo tortoises tended to perform settling behaviors (mean ± 1 SE days to building first burrow = 6.7 ± 0.8, entering dormancy = 23.3 ± 2.1, and emerging from dormancy = 189.6 ± 4.4) earlier than indoor-only tortoises (7.4 ± 0.9, 31.5 ± 2.6, and 193.9 ± 5.9, respectively), but this difference was not significant, suggesting the rearing method did not greatly alter settling behavior. Indoor-only tortoises dispersed at least twice as far from their release site (156.2 ± 26.3 m compared with 77.3 ± 20.6 m for combo tortoises), had larger mean use areas (3.7 ± 0.1 ha compared with 2.8 ± 0.3 ha for combo tortoises for 95% Brownian bridge movement model estimates), and greater variability in their movements than combo tortoises (daily average step length post-emergence: 4.3 ± 0.2 m compared with 2.8 ± 0.1 m for combo tortoises). Despite differences in their movements, indoor-only and combo tortoises had similar survival rates over the study, 51% versus 42%, respectively, during a period of extreme drought in 2021. The similarity in survival between groups gives head-starting practitioners freedom in their rearing methods. The indoor-only group had lower site fidelity, which should be considered when this is an undesirable trait for released tortoises.",

However, the 2017 ouster of Robert Mugabe gave rise to renewed hope for political change. Using the political settlements theoretical framework, and data obtained from interviews with Zimbabwean civil society leaders, studies of legal documents, and government pronouncements, we analyze the changes in the relationship between the state and civil society groups during President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s regime. We find that, while civil society faced restrictions during Mugabe's tenure, their existence is now under much more scrutiny under Mnangagwa’s militarized government. This is because authoritarian regimes are more likely to increase the suppression of citizen voices when faced with growing citizen engagement.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionWhile ultrasound-guided breast biopsy (UGBB) performed by a radiologist is the standard of care in high-income countries for diagnosing breast cancer, blind or surgical biopsy has been the norm in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) in part because LMIC radiologists lack the skill to perform UGBB. We present the study protocol of a competency-based UGBB training program for LMIC Nigerian radiologists that leverages mobile health technology.MethodsThis institutional review board-approved prospective multi-institutional single-arm clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04501419) involves 13 Nigerian radiologists from eight tertiary hospitals in South West and South East Nigeria. Our training program is unique because it uses a competency-based curriculum developed specifically for LMIC radiologists. The competency-based curriculum incorporates blended learning (e-learning and trainer-led), simulation (supervised and unsupervised), and patient biopsy (supervised and unsupervised) components. The study time frame is two years: 1 year for the trainees to complete active training and patient recruitment and another 1 year for patient follow-up. Primary outcome measures include trainees' competency (measured using the Ottawa Surgical Competency Operating Room Evaluation (O-SCORE)), the radiology-pathology concordance rate, and the complication rate. Secondary outcome measures include the diagnostic interval and the positive predictive value of UGBB.ConclusionBuilding capacity for UGBB in Nigeria and other LMIC can potentially improve breast cancer outcomes through early diagnosis. This training program is part of an implementation multi-component strategy package in Nigeria to improve breast cancer outcomes. This training program can also be adapted for other image-guided procedures that could impact global cancer control through diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and/or palliation.",

Here, we present the findings of TVP from processed broiler carcasses in Argentina following marked condemnation at the processing plant. We studied a total of 122 abnormally presenting proventriculi at processing from 42-to-50-day-old, male Cobb500™ broiler chicken carcasses from 11 farms belonging to the same company in 13 episodes of proventriculi-gizzards condemnation between December 2021 and April 2022. The proventriculi were enlarged and pale with a widened gastric isthmus. A histopathologic lesion score system was developed based on the presence of a combination of key microscopic findings, the distribution, and the severity of the lesions. Scoring of the affected proventriculi revealed 65% (79/122) with a score of 4, 23% (28/122) with a score of 3, and 12% (15/122) with a score of 2. Focal to multifocal immunoreactivity against the VP2-CPNV antigen within the necrotic glandular epithelial cells was noted in the affected proventriculi using immunohistochemistry. We found 84.4% (103/122) of the studied proventriculi with TVP lesions grossly and microscopically scored were positive for CPNV by RT-PCR. The sequencing results of the PCR product showed a high nucleotide sequence similarity (88.97%) to previously published VP1-CPNV sequences. We confirmed CPNV infection in most of the TVP affected proventriculi in all condemnation episodes at a broiler chicken processing plant in Argentina during the studied period. This study documents TVP associated with CPNV detection at processing plants in Argentina for the first time.",

The overarching objective of this study was to calibrate a gene-based model to predict wheat heading date that allows breeders to select specific gene combinations that would head within the optimal window for a given environment independently of varietal genetic background. A dataset with a total of 49 Argentine wheat cultivars and two recombinant inbred lines was chosen to cover a wide range of allelic combinations for major vernalization, photoperiod, and earliness per-se genes. The model was validated using independent data from an Argentine wheat trial network that includes sites from a wide latitudinal range. Ultimately, using this gene-based model, simulations were made to identify optimal gene combinations (ideotypes) × site combinations in contrasting locations. The selected model accurately predicted heading date with an overall median error of 4.6 days. This gene-based crop model for wheat phenology allowed the identification of groups of gene combinations predicted to head within a low-risk window and can be adapted to predict other phenological stages based on accessible climatic information and publicly available molecular markers, facilitating its adoption in wheat-growing regions worldwide.",

The preferences of citizens in developing countries, however, are not well understood on this matter. Do they prefer that their own governments control foreign aid resources, or are there conditions under which they instead prefer that donors maintain control over how aid is implemented? We explore these questions through parallel survey experiments in Myanmar, Nepal, and Indonesia. Our experimental vignettes include two informational treatments: one about who implements aid (i.e., the donor or the recipient government) and the other about the trustworthiness of the foreign donor. The trust-in-donor treatment, on average, increases levels of support for aid in all three countries. In contrast, we observe heterogenous average treatment effects regarding aid control: control of aid by the donor rather than the government reduces levels of support in Indonesia and Myanmar, whereas it increases support levels in Nepal. We show how the cross-country variation in ATEs originates in consistent individual-level variation in reactions to aid control that is more shaped by respondents’ trust in their own government than their trust in the donor.",

The efficacy of international pressure is often contingent on how publics in target states respond. Employing survey experiments, we examine how two common tools of external influence employed by other countries —verbal condemnation and the threat of aid withdrawal—affect public opinion in three Asian states that have been criticized for their human rights practices: Myanmar, Nepal, and Indonesia. Overall, we find that, in the face of such pressure, preference for the status quo policy becomes stronger among the supporters of incumbent governments in target states. In contrast, those who are not government partisans are more likely to support policy change for better human rights conditions. The latter, however, is the constituency less likely to exert influence on the government to revise its policy. Together, these findings point to the possibility that criticism and aid sanction threats employed by foreign countries will be ineffective or even counterproductive at least in the short run.",

This study considers whether and by what means OCC provides statutorily required \"needed-treatment\" addressing two aspects of its legal mandate to protect the safety of self (exclusive of deliberate-self-harm) and others. METHOD: Over a 12.4-year period, records of hospitalized-psychiatric-patients, 11,424 with CTO-assignment and 16,161 without CTO-assignment were linked to police-records. Imminent-safety-threats included perpetrations and victimizations by homicides, rapes, assaults/abductions, and robberies. \"Need for treatment\" determinations were validated independently by Health of the Nations Scale (HoNOS) severity-score-profiles. Logistic regressions, with propensity-score- adjustment and control for 46 potential confounding-factors, were used to evaluate the association of CTO-assignment with occurrence-risk of perpetrations and victimizations. RESULTS: CTO-assignment was associated with reduced safety-risk: 17% in initial-perpetrations, 11% in initial-victimizations, and 22% for repeat-perpetrations. Each ten-community-treatment-days in interaction with CTO-assignment was associated with a 3.4% reduced-perpetration-risk. CTO-initiated-re-hospitalization was associated with a 13% reduced-initial-perpetration-risk, a 17% reduced-initial-victimization-risk, and a 22% reduced-repeat-victimization-risk. All risk-estimates appear to be the unique contributions of the CTO, CTO-initiated-re-hospitalization, or the provision of ten-community-treatment-days-i.e. after accounting for the influence of prior crimes and victimizations, ethnic-bias, neighborhood disadvantage and other between-group differences in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: CTO assignment's association with reduced criminal-victimization and perpetration-risk, in conjunction with requiring participation in needed-treatment via re-hospitalization and community-service, adds support to the conclusion that OCC is to some extent fulfilling its legal objectives related to protecting safety of self (exclusive of deliberate-self-harm), and others.",

No published research has focused on the possible role of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) despite their widespread presence in human tissues. METHODS: We formulated two samples. The first was an operative sample comprising 495 women aged 18-44 years scheduled for laparoscopy/laparotomy at one of 14 participating clinical sites in the Salt Lake City or San Francisco area, 2007-2009. The second was a population-based sample comprising 131 women matched to the operative sample on age and residence within a 50-mile radius of participating clinics. Interviews and anthropometric assessments were conducted at enrollment, along with blood collection for the analysis of nine PFCs, which were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Endometriosis was defined based on surgical visualization (in the operative sample) or magnetic resonance imaging (in the population sample). Using logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each PFC (log-transformed), adjusting for age and body mass index, and then parity. RESULTS: Serum perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; OR = 1.89 [95% CI = 1.17-3.06]) and perfluorononanoic acid (2.20 [1.02-4.75]) were associated with endometriosis in the operative sample; findings were moderately attenuated with parity adjustment (1.62 [0.99-2.66] and 1.99 [0.91-4.33], respectively). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (1.86 [1.05-3.30]) and PFOA (2.58 [1.18-5.64]) increased the odds for moderate/severe endometriosis, although the odds were similarly attenuated with parity adjustment (OR = 1.50 and 1.86, respectively).

It argues that US officials used the prison system not only to extract labor, but to structure racial hierarchy and justify expansionist claims to jurisdiction and sovereignty. It reveals how despite the purported “usefulness” of the Black bodies conscripted in this brutal labor regime, the prison system's operational modality was racial and gendered violence which exceeded the registers of political economy, penology, and state-building in which that usefulness was framed. The Canal Zone convict road building scheme then became a cornerstone from which Good Roads Movement boosters, who claimed the convict was a slave of the state, could push for the Pan-American Highway across the hemisphere. Afro-Panamanian and Caribbean workers, who were the majority of those forced into Canal Zone chain gangs, protested the racism and imperialism of the prison system by blending anti-colonial and anti-racist strategies and deploying a positive notion of blackness as solidarity and race pride. Their efforts and insight offer an understanding of the US carceral state's imperial dimensions as well as enduring lessons for movements struggling to broaden the meaning and experience of freedom in the face of slavery's recurrent afterlives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "In January 2018, soon after he was elected President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte signed a comprehensive tax reform bill. In this paper, a nationwide survey and embedded experiment are used to investigate how ordinary Filipino citizens responded to different possible changes in tax incidence originating in the reform. The survey was conducted a few days prior to the enactment of the legislation. Our survey experiment yielded two noteworthy findings. First, Filipino citizens' interest in gathering information about the government budget and its usage increased when they were explicitly reminded of the possibility that the reform would change their tax burden; importantly, this occurred whether they expected their taxes to increase or decrease. Second, lower class citizens were more motivated than upper class citizens to monitor government when faced with the prospect of major tax burden changes. These findings not only shed light on how ordinary citizens in the Philippines reacted to the impending historic tax reform, but also reveal limits of the conventional fiscal contract conception of the link between taxation and accountability.",

      "abstract": "High-yielding varieties developed in the 1960s and 1970s at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and elsewhere benefited farmers and the public, ultimately increasing yields and reducing the cost of rice to consumers. Most of these varieties, however, did not have the optimum cooking quality that was possessed by many of the traditional varieties they replaced. In 1985, the IRRI-developed indica variety IR64 was released in the Philippines. In addition to its high yield, early maturity and disease resistance, it had excellent cooking quality, matching that of the best varieties available. These merits resulted in its rapid spread and cultivation on over 10 million ha in the two decades after it was released. It has intermediate amylose content and gelatinization temperature, and good taste. It is resistant to blast and bacterial blight diseases, and to brown planthopper. Because of its success as a variety, it has been used extensively in scientific studies and has been well-characterized genetically. Many valuable genes have been introduced into IR64 through backcross breeding and it has been used in thousands of crosses. Its area of cultivation has declined in the past 10 years, but it has been replaced by a new generation of high-quality varieties that are mostly its progeny or relatives. Continued basic studies on IR64 and related varieties should help in unraveling the complex genetic control of yield and other desirable traits that are prized by rice farmers and consumers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cause of most fetal anomalies is not determined prenatally. Exome sequencing has transformed genetic diagnosis after birth, but its usefulness for prenatal diagnosis is still emerging. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF), a fetal abnormality that is often lethal, has numerous genetic causes; the extent to which exome sequencing can aid in its diagnosis is unclear. METHODS: We evaluated a series of 127 consecutive unexplained cases of NIHF that were defined by the presence of fetal ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, skin edema, cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency, or a combination of these conditions. The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing for detecting genetic variants that were classified as either pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to the criteria of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of cases associated with specific genetic disorders and the proportion of variants that were inherited. RESULTS: In 37 of the 127 cases (29%), we identified diagnostic genetic variants, including those for disorders affecting the RAS-MAPK cell-signaling pathway (known as RASopathies) (30% of the genetic diagnoses); inborn errors of metabolism and musculoskeletal disorders (11% each); lymphatic, neurodevelopmental, cardiovascular, and hematologic disorders (8% each); and others. Prognoses ranged from a relatively mild outcome to death during the perinatal period. Overall, 68% of the cases (25 of 37) with diagnostic variants were autosomal dominant (of which 12% were inherited and 88% were de novo), 27% (10 of 37) were autosomal recessive (of which 95% were inherited and 5% were de novo), 1 was inherited X-linked recessive, and 1 was of uncertain inheritance. We identified potentially diagnostic variants in an additional 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In this large case series of 127 fetuses with unexplained NIHF, we identified a diagnostic genetic variant in approximately one third of the cases.

      "abstract": "In the Andes, mountains, rocks, and stones (all conceptually related) are power-ful entities that engage with human beings in different ways. Among other qual-ities, they take human shape, accomplish great deeds, heal, protect fields, or increase fertility. One aspect that has not been explored much is how stones can also work to reestablish a positive relationship between humans and superior forces. This article examines this capacity in the context of the largest Peruvian pilgrimage (also the highest in the world), the pilgrimage to the sanctuary of the Taytacha Qoyllurit’i (dear father of the shiny snow) located in Cuzco, Peru. This analysis takes place in relation to the central concept underlying the pil-grimage, that of pampachay, which literally means “flattening the ground.” While the whole pilgrimage is a way to maintain a reciprocal relationship with the Taytacha Qoyllur Rit’i (an image of Christ crucified on a rock at the bottom of a glacier), the traditional on-foot travel has specific key rituals that must take place along the way to reestablish this reciprocity. Pilgrims need to carry stones uphill and put them in designated places where they will leave them for good. By doing so pilgrims leave behind the part of themselves that might have disturbed the reciprocal relationship with the Taytacha.",

      "abstract": "The importance of global isoprene emissions has stimulated studies of oxidation mechanisms that follow the initial reaction of isoprene with atmospheric hydroxyl (OH). A key question involves the speed and pathways by which isoprene products isomerize. Some reactions in these mechanisms generate new hydroxyl, perhaps enough to recycle most hydroxyl. This research examines five different isoprene oxidation mechanisms using observations from a 2013 field study in an Alabama forest and a 2014 companion study in the Caltech Environmental Chamber. Model mechanisms and observations were compared for OH, hydroperoxyl (HO2), and the isoprene oxidation products: isoprene hydroxyhydroperoxide (ISOPOOH), isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX), hydroxyacetone, formaldehyde, methacrolein, and methyl vinyl ketone. Observed hydroxyl is generally simulated within uncertainties for both the chamber and the field studies, indicating that hydroxyl recycling is well captured by current model mechanisms, although two mechanisms are slightly better than the other three. When the observed and modeled uncertainties are considered, no currently accepted mechanism is clearly superior to the others for simulating isoprene products. For atmospheric conditions typical of forests-abundant isoprene and low nitric oxide-these model mechanisms produce concentrations of isoprene products that can be substantially different from observations and from each other. This result suggests both the common and different parts of the chemical mechanisms need to be reexamined, particularly by observing the later-generation products directly.",

Three pathogens are prevalent in farmed Atlantic salmon in BC, spill over to wild Pacific salmon, and are linked to negative impacts on wild salmon: Piscine orthoreovirus, Tenacibaculum spp., and sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). Molecular screening of infectious agents in farmed and wild salmon and environmental DNA highlights a further 4 agents that are likely elevated near salmon farms and 37 that co-occur in wild and farmed salmon. Pathogens likely affect wild salmon indirectly by mediating migration, competition, and predation. Current net-pen aquaculture practices pose these risks to numerous populations of all species of wild salmon in BC, most of which are not covered in Government of Canada science and advisory reports. Climate change, pathogen evolution, and changes to disease management and aquaculture regulations will influence future risks.",

      "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and regions investigated the potential use of wastewater-based disease surveillance as an early warning system. Initially, methods were created to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Investigators have since conducted extensive studies to examine the link between viral concentration in wastewater and COVID-19 cases in areas served by sewage treatment plants over time. However, only a few reports have attempted to create predictive models for hospitalizations at a county-level based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater. This study implemented a linear mixed-effects model that evaluates the association between levels of virus in wastewater and county-level hospitalizations. The model was then utilized to predict short-term county-level hospitalization trends in 21 counties in California based on data from March 21, 2022, to May 21, 2023. The modeling framework proposed here permits repeated measurements, as well as fixed and random effects. The model that incorporated wastewater data as an input variable rather than cases or test positivity rate exhibited robust performance and effectively captured discernible trends in hospitalizations. Additionally, the model allows for the prediction of SARS CoV-2 hospitalizations two weeks ahead. Forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations could provide crucial information for hospitals to better allocate resources and prepare for potential surges in patient numbers.",

The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) surveillance efforts of waterfowl for AIv have been largely discontinued in the contiguous United States. Consequently, the use of technologies to identify areas of high waterfowl density and detect the presence of AIv in habitat such as wetlands has become imperative. Here we identified two high waterfowl density areas in California using processed NEXt generation RADar (NEXRAD) and collected water samples to test the efficacy of two tangential flow ultrafiltration methods and two nucleic acid based AIv detection assays. Whole-segment amplification and long-read sequencing yielded more positive samples than standard M-segment qPCR methods (57.6% versus 3.0%, p < .0001). We determined that this difference in positivity was due to mismatches in published primers to our samples and that these mismatches would result in failing to detect in the vast majority of currently sequenced AIv genomes in public databases. The whole segment sequences were subsequently used to provide subtype and potential host information of the AIv environmental reservoir. There was no statistically significant difference in sequencing reads recovered from the RexeedTM filtration compared to the unfiltered surface water. This overall approach combining remote sensing, filtration and sequencing provides a novel and potentially more effective, surveillance approach for AIv.",

      "abstract": "Late-season weed emergence in California rice fields complicates decisions concerning the timing of control measures. The objective of this study was to predict the emergence of three problematic weed species in rice using thermal time models. Smallflower umbrella sedge, barnyardgrass, and bearded sprangletop seedlings were counted and removed daily at three locations across the Sacramento Valley rice-growing region in 2018. The accumulation of thermal time (growing degree days; GDD) commenced with the initial flooding of the fields at each location, utilizing the specific base temperatures corresponding to each species. The pattern of emergence as a function of GDD was modeled with a Weibull function. Root-mean-square values for comparing actual and model-predicted cumulative emergence values were 6% to 23%. Percent cumulative emergence initially increased rapidly for smallflower umbrella sedge and reached 90% emergence with accumulation of 13 GDD. Barnyardgrass emerged after smallflower umbrella sedge and reached 90% emergence with an accumulation of 124 GDD. Bearded sprangletop had a delay of 64 GDD compared to barnyardgrass to reach first emergence and reached 90% emergence at 215 GDD. The period of weed emergence at all field sites differed across the three species and led to a continuous spectrum of weed emergence over time. This study characterizes the emergence of three economically important rice weeds and provides useful information for the timing of weed management. Typical herbicide applications on the day of seeding may have less efficacy on the late-emerging weeds, causing reduced weed control. Delayed herbicide application, overlay of residual herbicides, or use of herbicides with longer residual activity are suggested to control late-emerging weeds.",

      "abstract": "Conservation translocations are often used to connect disjunct populations or reintroduce them to otherwise suitable areas from which they have become locally extinct. Translocations, however, can alter wildlife movements and increase their exposure to hazards such as predation, thus increasing their risk of mortality. The giant gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas, is a wetland-dependent threatened species that has lost > 90% of its historical habitat. Certain species recovery may depend on the success of translocations in restoring populations. We translocated snakes from two donor sites—one managed wetland and one rice agriculture site—to a third restored wetland in Sacramento County, California, USA, to evaluate the impact of translocations on home ranges and movements. Translocated snakes had smaller home ranges after translocation for the 95% and 100% MCP estimation, had smaller net displacements, but had similar measures of sinuosity (index that measures the curvature of a movement path), total distance moved, and start-to-end distance compared to their individual measurements before translocation. Landscape type, however, had the greatest effect on home range estimates and movement measures, with resident snakes from the rice agriculture site having greater home ranges and net displacements, and greater, less sinuous seasonal movement paths than snakes from both the donor and recipient wetland sites. Results varied depending on the specific metric, but overall, translocated snakes tended to have intermediate values for home range size, movement distances, and sinuosity compared to the two resident groups. Our results suggest that although translocation did affect movement and space use relative to resident snakes, its effect depended on the donor habitat from which translocated snakes were removed. Because irregular movements are often linked to low survival after translocation, it is encouraging that translocated snakes did not move more than snakes from a donor rice agriculture site, a landscape that represents much habitat for remaining populations.",

We suggest that developing measures of individual mitigation behaviors and testing them among high-risk individuals, including pregnant people, may help to reduce overall morbidity and mortality by quickly identifying targets for messaging around mitigation until sufficient vaccination uptake is reached. METHODS: We surveyed pregnant people in California over 2 waves of the COVID-19 pandemic to explore mitigation behaviors. We developed and validated a novel Viral Respiratory Illness Mitigation Scale (VRIMS). RESULTS: Seven measures loaded onto a single factor with good psychometric properties. The overall sample scale average was high over both waves, indicating that most pregnant Californians engaged in most of the strategies most of the time. Older participants, minoritized participants, those living in more urban contexts, and those surveyed during a surge reported engaging in these strategies most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and researchers should consider using reliable, validated measures like the VRIMS to identify individuals and communities that may benefit from additional education on reducing risk for COVID-19, future respiratory pandemics, or even seasonal flu.",

      "abstract": "Earthquake nowcasting has been proposed as a means of tracking the change in large earthquake potential in a seismically active area. The method was developed using observable seismic data, in which probabilities of future large earthquakes can be computed using Receiver Operating Characteristic methods. Furthermore, analysis of the Shannon information content of the earthquake catalogs has been used to show that there is information contained in the catalogs, and that it can vary in time. So an important question remains, where does the information originate? In this paper, we examine this question using stochastic simulations of earthquake catalogs. Our catalog simulations are computed using an Earthquake Rescaled Aftershock Seismicity (“ERAS”) stochastic model. This model is similar in many ways to other stochastic seismicity simulations, but has the advantage that the model has only 2 free parameters to be set, one for the aftershock (Omori-Utsu) time decay, and one for the aftershock spatial migration away from the epicenter. Generating a simulation catalog and fitting the two parameters to the observed catalog such as California takes only a few minutes of wall clock time. While clustering can arise from random, Poisson statistics, we show that significant information in the simulation catalogs arises from the “non-Poisson” power-law aftershock clustering, implying that the practice of de-clustering observed catalogs may remove information that would otherwise be useful in forecasting and nowcasting. We also show that the nowcasting method provides similar results with the ERAS model as it does with observed seismicity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy is a time of increased vulnerability to mental health disorders. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of depression and anxiety. Thus, we aimed to assess mental health and associated healthy behaviors of pregnant people in California during the pandemic in order to contextualize prenatal well-being during the first pandemic of the twenty-first century. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study of 433 pregnant people from June 6 through July 29, 2020. We explored 3 hypotheses: (1) mental health would be worse during the pandemic than in general pregnant samples to date; (2) first-time pregnant people would have worse mental health; and (3) healthy behaviors would be positively related to mental health. RESULTS: Many of our participants (22%) reported clinically significant depressive symptoms and 31% reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms. Multiparous pregnant people were more likely to express worries about their own health and wellbeing and the process of childbirth than were primiparous pregnant people. Additionally, as pregnancy advanced, sleep and nutrition worsened, while physical activity increased. Lastly, anxious-depressive symptomology was significantly predictive of participant sleep behaviors, nutrition, and physical activity during the past week. DISCUSSION: Pregnant people had worse mental health during the pandemic, and this was associated with worse health-promoting behaviors. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated risks are likely to persist due to low vaccination rates and the emergence of variants with high infection rates, care that promotes mental and physical well-being for the pregnant population should be a public health priority.",

It occurs as an understory vine in riparian and chaparral areas and in forest edges and windrows. The geographic range of this plant species almost entirely overlaps with that of its major specialized herbivore, the California Pipevine Swallowtail Butterfly Battus philenor hirsuta. While this species pair is a useful, ecologically well-understood system to study co-evolution, until recently, genomic resources for both have been lacking. Here, we report a new, chromosome-level assembly of A. californica as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Following the sequencing and assembly strategy of the CCGP, we used Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Hi-C chromatin proximity sequencing technology to produce a de novo assembled genome. Our genome assembly, the first for any species in the genus, contains 531 scaffolds spanning 661 megabase (Mb) pairs, with a contig N50 of 6.53 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 42.2 Mb, and BUSCO complete score of 98%.

Using a state-representative survey of California adults (n = 2870) administered in July 2020, we estimate the prevalence of anticipatory concerns about violence within respondents' social networks and describe characteristics of the persons at perceived risk of violence, reasons for respondents' concerns, and actions undertaken by respondents to reduce that risk. Approximately 1 in 5 respondents knew at least one person, usually a friend or extended family member, whom they perceived to be at risk of other- or self-directed violence. Among respondents living with the person at perceived risk, about one-quarter reported household firearm ownership. Alcohol and substance misuse and a history of violence were among respondents' top reasons for concern; serious mental illness and firearm access also contributed to concerns. About one-quarter of respondents with such concerns said harm was likely or very likely to occur in the next year. Most respondents reported having taken action to reduce the risk of violence, including providing resources and asking family or friends to help; few acted to reduce access to lethal means. The most common reasons for inaction were the perception that a dangerous situation was unlikely and that it was a personal matter. Our findings can help inform a broader understanding of exposure to violence and interventions that leverage the knowledge of those close to persons at risk to prevent violence.",

This study generates hypotheses regarding the farm- and animal-level variables (e.g., vaccination, lane cleaning, and AMD use practices) that may be associated with AMR in respiratory isolates from weaned dairy heifers. A cross-sectional study was performed using survey data and respiratory isolates (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Histophilus somni) collected from 341 weaned dairy heifers on six farms in California. Logistic regression and Bayesian network analyses were used to evaluate the associations between farm- and animal-level variables with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classification of respiratory isolates against 11 AMDs. Farm-level variables associated with MIC classification of respiratory isolates included the number of source farms of a calf-rearing facility, whether the farm practiced onsite milking, the use of lagoon water for flush lane cleaning, and respiratory and pinkeye vaccination practices. Animal-level variables associated with a MIC classification included whether the calf was BRD-score-positive and time since the last phenicol treatment.",

      "abstract": "The Geysers geothermal field in California is experiencing land subsidence due to the seismic and geothermal activities taking place. This poses a risk not only to the underlying infrastructure but also to the groundwater level which would reduce the water availability for the local community. Because of this, it is crucial to monitor and assess the surface deformation occurring and adjust geothermal operations accordingly. In this study, we examine the correlation between the geothermal injection and production rates as well as the seismic activity in the area, and we show the high correlation between the injection rate and the number of earthquakes. This motivates the use of this data in a machine learning model that would predict future deformation maps. First, we build a model that uses interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images that have been processed and turned into a deformation time series using LiCSBAS, an open-source InSAR time series package, and evaluate the performance against a linear baseline model. The model includes both convolutional neural network (CNN) layers as well as long short-term memory (LSTM) layers and is able to improve upon the baseline model based on a mean squared error metric. Then, after getting preprocessed, we incorporate the geothermal data by adding them as additional inputs to the model. This new model was able to outperform both the baseline and the previous version of the model that uses only InSAR data, motivating the use of machine learning models as well as geothermal data in assessing and predicting future deformation at The Geysers as part of hazard mitigation models which would then be used as fundamental tools for informed decision making when it comes to adjusting geothermal operations.",

DATA SOURCES/SETTING: Electronic health records from a large, health care delivery system for 223,730 patients with diabetes prescribed 842,899 new cardiometabolic medications during 2006-2012. STUDY DESIGN: Observational, new prescription cohort study of the effect of OOP cost on medication initiation and adherence. DATA COLLECTION: Adherence and OOP costs were based on pharmacy dispensing records and benefits. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Primary nonadherence (never dispensed) increased monotonically with OOP cost after adjusting for demographics, neighborhood socioeconomic status, Medicare, medical financial assistance, OOP maximum, deductibles, mail order pharmacy incentive and use, drug type, generic or brand, day's supply, and comorbidity index; 7 percent were never dispensed the new medication when OOP cost ≥$11, 5 percent with OOP cost of $1-$10, and 3 percent when the medication was free of charge (p < .0001). Higher OOP cost was also strongly associated with inadequate secondary adherence (≥20 percent of time without adequate medication). There was no clinically significant or consistent relationship between OOP costs and early nonpersistence (dispensed once, never refilled) or later stage nonpersistence (discontinued within 24 months). CONCLUSIONS: Cost-sharing may deter clinically vulnerable patients from initiating essential medications, undermining adherence and risk factor control.",

Four of 15 SSO K. pneumoniae isolates were HMV and all were recovered from SSOs that stranded during 2005. Many K. pneumoniae infections were associated with moderate to severe pathology as a cause of death or sequela. All HMV infections were assessed as a primary cause of death or as a direct result of the primary cause of death. Klebsiella-infected SSOs exhibited bronchopneumonia, tracheobronchitis and/or pleuritis, enteritis, Profilicollis sp. acanthocephalan peritonitis, septic peritonitis, and septicemia. All SSO HMV isolates were capsular type K2, the serotype most associated with HMV infections in CSLs. Multiplex PCR revealed two distinct virulence gene profiles within HMV isolates and two within non-HMV isolates. In vitro experiments investigating CSL whole blood and serum killing of K. pneumoniae suggest that HMV isolates are more resistant to serum killing than non-HMV isolates.",

Still, we lack large-scale studies focusing on disseminating these practices into routine clinical care. This is especially important to study within safety-net healthcare settings that disproportionately care for marginalized patient populations. METHODS: We will conduct a hybrid type 1 implementation trial (2 × 2 factorial design) with 25 safety-net clinics across three of California's public healthcare delivery systems, enrolling 2500 English- and Spanish-speaking patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Clinics will be randomized to receive baseline training on best practices in remote monitoring for hypertension management vs. training plus ongoing practice facilitation to support its implementation. Patients within these clinics will be randomized to receive cellular-enabled blood pressure monitors and automatic text message reminders to check their blood pressure at home vs. receipt of the same monitors as well as additional support via individually tailored text message feedback and support for hypertension management. RESULTS: The primary outcome will be a change in systolic blood pressure collected during routine office visits. Secondary outcomes include changes in home blood pressure and patient-reported assessments of clinical care and medication adherence. Given the hybrid type I trial implementation, the primary implementation outcomes will be the adoption of intervention at the patient and clinic levels. DISCUSSION: The evidence from this trial will advance implementation-focused research on hypertension management, such as the essential combination of both patient- and clinic-facing intervention strategies.

      "abstract": "Increased use of pyrethroids in the Central Coast of California since 2011 has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number and proportion of surface water samples with detectable concentrations at levels of concern to the public and state regulators. The goals of this study were to investigate the relationships between pyrethroid usage and environmental contamination, quantify and assess the potential risks, and recommend mitigation strategies. This study compiled the available pyrethroid use and surface water sampling data for the region, and then applied GIS methods to dynamic simulation modeling and usage-restriction buffer analyses. The results showed that in Monterey County alone, the agricultural usages of bifenthrin and permethrin each increased by ~50%, and the positive detection frequencies of both also increased around 2011-2013. County-wide, bifenthrin positive detections in surface water samples increased precipitously from 8.2% (7/85) for 2008-2012 up to 36.4% (106/291) for 2013-2017, and detections above its crustacean LC50 concentration went from 7.1% (6/85) to 35.7% (104/291). Despite its higher usage by mass, comparable figures for permethrin were more modest for the same time-periods, with positive detections going from 10.6% (9/85) to 14.4% (64/444), and detections above its crustacean LC50 going from 3.5% (3/85) to 7.2% (32/444). The seasonal lag between high bifenthrin usage in spring/summer and high detections in fall/winter samples showed the best correlations with 128- to 182-day lag times. This timing suggests that fallow season rain is likely the main driver of pyrethroid off-site movement into surface waters. SWAT modeling indicated that significant reductions in surface water permethrin concentrations only occurred with buffer distances of 1.6-3.2 km, but not with narrower buffers. However, if those wider buffers were implemented, permethrin could no longer be used on the majority of land where it is currently applied. Specifically, a 1.6-km buffer reduced the instream concentration by 8% but impacted 50% of the cropland, and a 3.2-km buffer reduced the concentration by 50% while impacting 76% of cropland. This study suggested that more promising alternative management practices could include an overall reduction in pyrethroid usage back to 2011 levels or other active mitigation strategies, like planting cover crops during the fallow winter wet season, or installing either vegetated buffer strips and/or sediment check dams on small tributaries to minimize sediment runoff.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trauma is a major public health problem and organized systems of trauma care have been shown to substantially reduce trauma-related mortality. Currently California and many other states have incompletely developed systems of trauma care delivery. This study was undertaken to determine how frequently patients incurring serious trauma in California receive treatment at a trauma center. STUDY DESIGN: Hospital discharge records for 360,743 acute trauma patients for 1995 to 1997 were analyzed. Abbreviated Injury Scale scores were calculated from discharge diagnosis codes. Severity of trauma and the need for trauma center treatment was defined by eight Abbreviated Injury Scale criteria combined with patient age and type of injury. RESULTS: According to study criteria, 67,718 patients needed trauma center care and 56% were treated at a trauma center. Among patients less than 55 years of age, 62% were treated at a trauma center compared with 40% of those aged 55 years or more (p < 0.0001). For patients less than 55 years old with brain injuries, 66% were treated at a trauma center compared with 44% for patients aged 55 years or more (p < 0.0001). Of the 29,849 patients who met Abbreviated Injury Scale criteria but were not treated at trauma centers, 59% were in counties with designated trauma centers and 41% were in counties without trauma centers. CONCLUSIONS: Only 56% of seriously injured patients in California were treated at trauma centers, despite most of the injuries occurring in the catchment areas of designated trauma care systems. Substantial undertriage of serious trauma patients to trauma centers appears to be occurring, especially in older persons and in persons with brain injuries. Efforts to understand why undertriage is occurring so frequently are hampered by fragmentation of the systems of care, inadequate data management systems, and lack of trauma care performance reporting by non-trauma center hospitals.",

The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) (1998) established chronic transfusions as the standard of care for children with SCD at high risk for stroke. Using statewide data from the California Department of Health Care Access and Innovation (1991-2019), we determined the cumulative incidence (CMI) and rates of primary and recurrent strokes/TIAs in people with SCD pre- and post-STOP trial. For the 7636 patients included in our SCD cohort, the cumulative incidence of the first ischemic stroke was 2.1% by the age of 20 years and 13.5% by the age of 60 years. The CMI of the first intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was 0.5% and 6.8% by the age of 20 and 60 years, respectively. Ischemic stroke rates increased in children (age <18 years; 234.9 vs 165.1 per 100 000 patient years [PY]; P = .012) and adults (age 31-50 years; 431.1 vs 303.2 per 100 000 PY; P = .031) in 2010 to 2019 when compared with the preceding decade. There was an increase in the rates of ICH in those aged 18 to 30 years and TIA in children <18 years from 2010 to 2019 when compared with the previous decade. Risk factors for strokes included increasing age, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. These findings underscore the need for stroke prevention in adults with SCD, suggesting an emphasis on management of modifiable cerebrovascular risk factors that have been proven to be effective in the general population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus (CA-Sa) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are historically associated with densely populated urban areas experiencing high poverty rates, intravenous drug use, and homelessness. However, the epidemiology of CA-Sa SSTIs in the United States has been poorly understood since the plateau of the Community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemic in 2010. This study examines the spatial variation of CA-Sa SSTIs in a large, geographically heterogeneous population and identifies neighborhood characteristics associated with increased infection risk. METHODS: Using a unique neighborhood boundary, California Medical Service Study Areas, a hotspot analysis, and estimates of neighborhood infection risk ratios were conducted for all CA-Sa SSTIs presented in non-Federal California emergency departments between 2016 and 2019. A Bayesian Poisson regression model evaluated the association between neighborhood-level infection risk and population structure, neighborhood poverty rates, and being a healthcare shortage area. RESULTS: Emergency departments in more rural and mountainous parts of California experienced a higher burden of CA-Sa SSTIs between 2016 and 2019. Neighborhoods with high infection rates were more likely to have a high percentage of adults living below the federal poverty level and be a designated healthcare shortage area. Measures of population structure were not associated with infection risk in California neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight a potential change in the epidemiology of CA-Sa SSTIs in California emergency departments. Future studies should investigate the CA-Sa burden in other geographies to identify whether this shift in epidemiology holds across other states and populations. Further, a more thorough evaluation of potential mechanisms for the clustering of infections seen across California neighborhoods is needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A prolonged first episode of psychosis (FEP) without adequate treatment is a predictor of poor clinical, functional, and health outcomes and significant economic burden. Team-based \"coordinated specialty care\" (CSC) for early psychosis (EP) has established effectiveness in promoting clinical and functional recovery. However, California's CSC program implementation has been unsystematic and could benefit from standardizing its processes and data collection infrastructure. To address this, we established a consortium of EP clinics across the state via a Learning Health Care Network (LHCN) framework to develop the Early Psychosis Intervention Network of California (EPI-CAL). EPI-CAL's LHCN developed a core battery of evidence-based measures for service users and family members and linked them together using a unique data collection and visualization application, Beehive. METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: EPI-CAL's LHCN collects, visualizes, and aggregates data at the individual and clinic level for EP programs across California via Beehive. Beehive was designed to: (1) collect outcomes data from service users receiving care at EP programs and their support persons, (2) provide the data to providers on a secure web-based dashboard to support measurement-based care, and (3) allow data to be used for program or research analysis. We will (1) determine the feasibility of implementing an LHCN across a diverse, decentralized network of early psychosis programs, (2) determine if the implementation of an LHCN increases the delivery of measurement-based care, and (3) determine if the implementation of measurement-based care is associated with significant improvements in key service user outcomes. EPI-CAL's network will contribute data to the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET) program. DISCUSSION: The current study aims to establish an LHCN of EP clinics in California that implements harmonized data collection using Beehive and assesses the feasibility of establishing such a network. Our goal is for this harmonized data collection approach to be used to inform decisions and develop learning opportunities for service users, staff, and administrators, and to improve outcomes for service users and their supporters in CSC care. Further, the data will enable programs and research teams to examine what elements of care lead to program success and improved treatment outcomes for service users.

      "abstract": "Almond band canker and prune Cytospora canker have become more severe in the last decade, especially in young orchards, in California. To test our hypothesis that young trees from nurseries could carry the canker-causing pathogens at latency phase to new orchards through transplanting, a multiyear survey on latent infection of canker-causing pathogens of budwood and young trees of almond and prune nurseries in California was conducted. A total of more than 1,730 samples including shoots of rootstocks and scions and grafting union cuttings were collected from 11 nurseries. A real-time quantitative PCR assay was applied to quantify the latent infection levels by six canker-causing pathogen taxa: Botryosphaeria dothidea and species of Cytospora, Diplodia, Lasiodiplodia, Neofusicoccum, and Phomopsis. For almond, the average incidences of latent infection caused by Lasiodiplodia spp. (43.6%) and Neofusicoccum spp. (24.2%) were significantly greater than those by the other four pathogen taxa. The molecular severity (MS) of latent infection caused by Neofusicoccum spp. (3.6) was significantly greater than those caused by other pathogen taxa, except for Lasiodiplodia spp. (2.6). For prune, the average incidence of latent infection caused by Cytospora spp. (13.5%) was significantly higher than those caused by B. dothidea (1.5%) and Diplodia spp. (1.3%) but not significantly higher than those caused by Lasiodiplodia spp. (6.9%), Neofusicoccum spp. (6.3%), and Phomopsis spp. (7.7%), respectively. Moreover, the average MS values caused by Cytospora spp. (3.8) and Neofusicoccum spp. (3.2) were the highest followed by those caused by B. dothidea (1.4), Lasiodiplodia spp. (2.2), and Phomopsis spp. (2.3). Different almond varieties showed various levels of susceptibilities to different canker-causing pathogens. This study concluded that Lasiodiplodia and Neofusicoccum are the predominant pathogen species in almond, and Cytospora is the most important canker-causing pathogen species in prune in nurseries. These findings confirmed the observations of predominancy of canker-causing pathogens in almond and prune orchards in California.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism is common and usually managed as an outpatient. A better understanding of patients at risk for an emergency department (ED) visit can improve health-care utilization and patient care. METHODS: The California Cancer Registry and Health Care Access and Information Databases were linked to identify patients who underwent a thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer 2005-2018 and had an ED visit for hypoparathyroidism within 2 y of surgery. Cumulative incidence and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with an ED visit. RESULTS: Among 41,502 thyroidectomy patients, 588 (1.42%) presented to the ED for hypoparathyroidism, with a median time between thyroidectomy and first ED visit of 4 ds. Two-year cumulative incidence was highest for women (1.56%), Hispanic patients (2.04%), younger adults aged 18-40 y (1.97%), higher Charlson comorbidity index score (2.43%), lowest neighborhood socioeconomic status quintile (1.97%), patients with >4 lymph nodes removed (2.04%), and patients not seen at an American College of Surgeons Committee on Cancer site (1.60%). Multivariable analysis revealed several factors associated with an increased risk of hypoparathyroidism, including female gender (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-2.10), Hispanic ethnicity (HR 1.41, 95% CI = 1.16-1.71), a higher Charlson comorbidity index score (≥2 = HR 1.91 [95% CI = 1.46-2.51]), and patients with >4 lymph nodesremoved (HR 1.70 [95% CI = 1.43-2.01]). CONCLUSIONS: ED visits for postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism are uncommon, but usually occurs shortly after surgery. Most risk factors identified are not modifiable, but they help identify high-risk patients who could benefit from targeted postoperative care (programs) to reduce unplanned ED visits.",

STUDY DESIGN: This single-institution case series included 20 patients who underwent in-office bone-anchored hearing implant placement under local anesthesia from 2018 to 2021. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Northern California Healthcare System. METHODS: Following completion of the case series, patients were retrospectively surveyed regarding their satisfaction with this approach via a modified SSQ-8 (Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire) to fit our purposes. RESULTS: A total of 23 implants were completed in the in-office setting on 20 patients. Intra- and postoperative complication rates, including skin changes, irritation, infection, and poor wound healing, were similar to or better than currently published complication rates in the literature. In addition, patients reported overwhelmingly positive responses on the SSQ-8, almost universally stating that they were \"very satisfied\" with their clinic experience. CONCLUSION: This case series suggests that it is feasible and safe to complete this procedure in the clinic under local anesthesia, but further prospective studies are needed to evaluate this in a more generalized population.",

Knowing how communities are affected by these wildfires is vital to understanding recovery. We sought to identify impacted communities' post-wildfire needs and characterize how those needs change over time. The WHAT-Now study deployed a survey that was made publicly available for communities affected by the October 2017 Northern California wildfires or the accompanying smoke at beginning approximately four months post-fire with the vast majority completed by nine months post-fire. Among other questions, the survey asked an adult household member to report on their households' greatest need both one-week post-fire and at the time of survey. A total of 1461 households responded to these questions. Households reported many types of needs, with 154 responses that did not directly name needs but rather described how their households had been affected, which we classified as impacts. Four major themes were identified: physical, health, air, and information, each representing an array of varied specific needs or impacts. Physical needs (e.g. housing, food) were the most common (cited by more than 50% during the fires and about a third at the time of survey). The need for clean air was strong during the fires, but not months later, at the time of survey. In contrast, health needs were reported by a quarter of households during the fires. Needs that were reported at both times were categorized as 'persistent', and there were more persistent mental health needs over time compared to other health themes. Understanding the needs and impacts that arise during wildfires, their diversity and duration, and how they change over time is crucial to identifying types of assistance that are most needed during recovery efforts and when they are needed. Results presented here along with other wildfire needs assessments can be utilized to improve disaster preparedness, including for wildfire recovery.",

Measurements of the contributions of wildfire smoke to ambient air pollutants, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), at fine resolution scales would be valuable to public health research on climate vulnerable populations and compound climate risks. We estimate the influence of wildfire smoke emissions on daily PM2.5 at fine-resolution, 3 km, for California 2011–2020, using a geostatistical modeled ambient PM2.5 estimate and wildfire smoke plume data from NOAA Hazard Mapping System. Additionally, we compare this product with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) daily and annual standards for PM2.5 exposure. Our results show wildfires significantly influence PM2.5 in California and nearly all exceedances of the daily US EPA PM2.5 standard were influenced by wildfire smoke, while annual exceedances were increasingly attributed to wildfire smoke influence in recent years. This wildfire-influenced PM2.5 product can be applied to public health research to better understand source-specific air pollution impacts and assess the combination of multiple climate hazard risks.",

      "abstract": "During droughts, potable water agencies may need to increase supply or reduce demand. Water agencies have many options for water demand management (WDM), including low flow toilets, showerheads, faucet aerators, educational outreach, and more. Reduced water consumption may result in energy savings, both at the customer and utility level. In this study, we estimated household water, electricity, and natural gas and utility-wide energy savings using statistical modeling for four large water demand management programs implemented between 2014 and 2018 in California. These programs focused on single and multifamily retrofit programs. These retrospective analyses were performed using household-level data gathered from multiple water, electricity, and natural gas companies. We found detectable water savings in three of the four programs, no detectable electricity savings for any program, and detectable gas savings in only one program. The deemed estimates of water savings were generally inaccurate predictors of actual savings. All programs that reduced household water consumption also reduced system-wide electricity consumption. A benefit-cost analysis was performed for each program from the perspectives of three stakeholders: water utilities, households, and a regulatory authority responsible for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Many of the program actions were not cost-effective for the participating utilities and households because of the low cost of water. For the WDM programs considered here cost-effective from the perspective of the water utilities, the opportunity cost of consuming an additional unit of water would have to exceed their observed variable production costs in 2020 by a factor of 3 to nearly 20, dependent on the utility. In settings with sufficiently severe drought conditions and impending water scarcity, it is certainly plausible to expect that the opportunity cost of water consumption could reach such levels. WDM is an effective method of reducing GHG emissions for programs that target hot water savings, and the cost of these programs was consistent with non-water-related programs that target GHG emission reductions.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Veterans Affair (VA) Northern California Healthcare System (NCHS) encounters from 2006 to 2021 for benign obstructive salivary etiologies were identified using International Classification of Disease 9/10 codes. This cohort was then cross referenced with Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify patients who underwent a procedure for their salivary pathologies. The rates of sialadenectomy and minimally invasive procedures were measured before and after sialendoscopy was introduced to the VA NCHCS in 2016. Data was obtained via chart review and demographic information, diagnosis, and procedure type were extracted. Rates of sialadenectomy, minimally invasive procedures, and other patient and procedural characteristics were compared between the Pre-Sialendoscopy Era (PSE) and Sialendoscopy Era (SE). Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, version 16.66). RESULTS: An increasing number of patients per year sought care for benign obstructive salivary pathology in the SE when compared to the PSE cohort and a higher rate of female patients were treated in the SE cohort. A simultaneous reduction in sialadenectomy rates and increase in minimally invasive procedure rates was observed in the SE. Sialendoscopy represented most of the increase in minimally invasive techniques, but there was a slight increase in other procedure types. Submandibular gland obstructive pathologies required the most procedures and resulted in the most gland excisions. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review strongly suggests introducing sialendoscopy reduced the incidence of sialadenectomy for benign non-tumor obstructive pathology in this VA NCHS population. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate this in a more generalized setting.",

      "abstract": "This short communication describes a new open-source implementation of the CALVIN model (CALifornia Value Integrated Network), a large-scale network flow optimization model of California's water supply system. The model is cross-platform, uses common data formats, and connects to several freely available linear programming solvers. Given inputs including hydrology, urban/agricultural demand curves, and variable operating costs, the model minimizes the systemwide cost of water scarcity and operations including surface and groundwater reservoirs, wastewater reuse, desalination, environmental flow requirements, and hydropower. Key outputs include water shortage costs and marginal economic values of water and infrastructure capacity. We benchmark the scalability of different solvers up to roughly 5 million decision variables, using shared-memory parallelization on a high performance computing cluster. Runtimes are reduced by two orders of magnitude relative to the original model when no initial solution is provided, in addition to the benefits such as accessibility and transparency that come with an open-source platform. While this model is specific to California, the data and model structure are separated, so a similar framework could be used in any system where water allocation has been formulated as a network flow problem.",

      "abstract": "The effective reproduction number serves as a metric of population-wide, time-varying disease spread. During the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, this metric was primarily derived from case data, which has varied in quality and representativeness due to changes in testing volume, test-seeking behavior, and resource constraints. Deriving nowcasting estimates from alternative data sources such as wastewater provides complementary information that could inform future public health responses. We estimated county-aggregated, sewershed-restricted wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction numbers from May 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 for five counties in California with heterogeneous population sizes, clinical testing rates, demographics, wastewater coverage, and sampling frequencies. We used two methods to produce sewershed-restricted effective reproduction numbers, both based on smoothed and deconvolved wastewater concentrations. We then population-weighted and aggregated these sewershed-level estimates to arrive at county-level effective reproduction numbers. Using mean absolute error (MAE), Spearman's rank correlation (ρ), confusion matrix classification, and cross-correlation analyses, we compared the timing and trajectory of our two wastewater-based models to: (1) a publicly available, county-level ensemble of case-based estimates, and (2) county-aggregated, sewershed-restricted case-based estimates. Both wastewater models demonstrated high concordance with the traditional case-based estimates, as indicated by low mean absolute errors (MAE ≤ 0.09), significant positive Spearman correlation (ρ ≥ 0.66), and high confusion matrix classification accuracy (≥ 0.81). The relative timings of wastewater- and case-based estimates were less clear, with cross-correlation analyses suggesting strong associations for a wide range of temporal lags that varied by county and wastewater model type. This methodology provides a generalizable, robust, and operationalizable framework for estimating county-level wastewater-based effective reproduction numbers. Our retrospective evaluation supports the potential usage of real-time wastewater-based nowcasting as a complementary epidemiological tool for surveillance by public health agencies at the state and local levels. Based on this research, we produced publicly available wastewater-based nowcasts for the California Communicable diseases Assessment Tool (calcat.cdph.ca.gov).",

Microscopically, there was severe necrotizing and suppurative inflammation in the lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and, when present, the placenta, with intralesional bacterial colonies. All cases were received from northern and central California in the winter and spring.

However, these low average curtailment rates may overstate how much renewable supply increases as a result of further increases in renewable capacity. Using historical hourly generation and curtailment data from California's electricity market, we estimate that only 91% of the output supplied by new solar capacity goes towards increasing the state's renewable supply — with the remaining 9% being discarded in the form of increased curtailments.",

      "abstract": "Yes. Plain Language Summary The question of whether earthquake occurrence is random in time, or perhaps chaotic with order hidden in the chaos, is of major importance to the determination of risk from these events. It was shown many years ago that if aftershocks are removed from the earthquake catalogs, what remains are apparently events that occur at random time intervals, and therefore not predictable in time. In the present work, we enlist machine learning methods using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. With these methods, probabilities of large events and their associated information value can be computed. Here information value is defined using Shannon entropy, shown by Claude Shannon to define the surprise value of a communication such as a string of computer bits. Random messages can be shown to have high entropy, surprise value, or uncertainty, whereas low entropy is associated with reduced uncertainty and high reliability. An earthquake nowcast probability associated with reduced uncertainty and greater reliability is most desirable. Examples of the latter could be the statements that there is a 90% probability of a major earthquake within 3 years, or a 5% chance of a major earthquake within 1 year. Despite the random intervals between major earthquakes, we find that it is possible to make low uncertainty, high reliability statements on current hazard by the use of machine learning methods using catalog data from 1970-present.",

      "abstract": "Meeting the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited resources will require increasing the yield potential of staple crops, such as rice. Yet many high-yielding, intensive production systems have experienced slow rates of yield improvement in recent years despite a demonstrated increase in the yield potential of new crop cultivars. We analyzed experimental data from one such cropping system, i.e., California (CA) rice, in order to quantify improvements made in the genetic yield potential obtained through plant breeding. California rice systems are among the highest in the world and close to maximum yield potential. Specifically, the hypothesis was tested that if rice cultivar yields decline over time then apparent yield increases in side-by-side yield comparison tests will not reflect increases in yield potential. This hypothesis was tested using 33 years of experimental yield data from the California Cooperative Rice Research Foundation Rice Experiment Station. Based on side-by-side comparisons of old and new rice cultivars which do not consider yield decline over time, there was an apparent increase in yield. However, the yields of older cultivars were found to decline at an estimated rate of 29.3 kg ha−1 year−1 (90% credible interval −4.4 to −53.3) after initial selection. Once this effect was considered, the yield advantage of newer cultivars over old was uncertain (−3.3 kg ha−1 year−1, 90% credible interval −36.1 to 31.5). These results highlight (1) the importance of continuous crop improvement and deployment of new cultivars simply to maintain existing yields, and (2) to increase the genetic yield potential, higher yield targets are needed. Importantly, when breeding near the yield potential, despite the limited yield gains, significant advances in improving quality and reducing crop duration have been made.",

      "abstract": "Freshwater fishes are increasingly facing extinction. Some species will require conservation intervention such as habitat restoration and/or population supplementation through mass-release of hatchery fish. In California, USA, a number of conservation strategies are underway to increase abundance of the endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus); however, it is unclear how different estuarine conditions influence hatchery fish. The goal of this study was to evaluate a year of Delta Smelt field deployments to inform species conservation strategies of suitable conditions for smelt physiology. Hatchery-reared Delta Smelt was deployed in experimental cages (seven deployments) throughout the Estuary in the winter, summer and fall of 2019. Effects of season and location of cage deployments on fish health (condition factor and histological condition of liver and gill), growth, thermal tolerance and survival were evaluated. The results indicate both seasonal and location differences, with high survival in the winter (100%) and fall (88-92%) compared to lower survival in summer (67%). In the summer, one of the study sites had no surviving fish following high temperature exposure, which peaked ~26°C. After 29 days in the cages, surviving Delta Smelt in summer and fall showed signs of nutritional stress that may be related to biofouling of the cages limiting passive food inputs, restriction of natural foraging behaviour by containment in the cages, and water temperatures that were too high given the chronically low pelagic productivity in the Estuary overall. Field measurements of upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) following caging exposures suggest that laboratory measures of CTmax may overestimate the realized tolerance in a more stochastic field environment. This study demonstrates the utility of using cages as an experimental tool to better understand aspects of Delta Smelt physiological responses to environmental changes across estuarine habitats in a more natural-field setting, while also highlighting potential limitations of using cages.",

Whether BMI impacts BC stage at diagnosis and BC specific survival (BCSS) is not understood. We aim to better understand the relationship between BMI with stage at BC diagnosis and BCSS. METHODS: Women age ≥ 15 years old diagnosed with BC between 2014 and 2019 were identified from the California Cancer Registry. BMI at diagnosis was classified as underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2), obesity class 1-2 (30-39.9 kg/m2), and obesity class 3 (≥ 40 kg/m2). BC late stage of diagnosis was defined as American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3 and 4. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to compare sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with late stage. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression models assessed association of BMI and BCSS. RESULTS: Of 159,248 patients: 2.2% were underweight, 34.6% normal weight, 30.5% overweight, 26.7% obesity class 1-2, and 6.0% obesity class 3. Compared to normal weight, patients who were underweight [Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.54, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.51-1.57], obesity class 1-2 [HR 1.06, 1.05-1.07], and obesity class 3 [HR 1.14, 1.12-1.16] were more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage BC. In models stratified by age, patients ≥ 40 years who were underweight had worse BCSS, while patients ≥ 51 years with obesity class 1-2 had better BCSS. CONCLUSION: Patients with obesity class 1-2 were more likely to be diagnosed with a later stage, but had improved BCSS, supporting an \"obesity paradox\" in BC and suggesting that other measures are needed to better assess body composition, adipose distribution, and metabolic health of patients. Patients who were underweight had worse survival, suggesting this high-risk group may benefit from being assessed and treated for possible sarcopenia and malnourishment.",

Using genomic prediction approaches, we pinpoint the origin of the Green Revolution to the early 1950s and uncover significant increases in additive genetic variation caused by transgressive segregation and phenotypic diversification. Lastly, we show that the most consequential Green Revolution breeding breakthrough was the introduction of photoperiod-insensitive, PERPETUAL FLOWERING hybrids in the 1970s that doubled yields and drove the dramatic expansion of strawberry production in California.",

      "abstract": "Heterosis was the catalyst for the domestication of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa), an interspecific hybrid species that originated in the 1700s. The hybrid origin was discovered because the phenotypes of spontaneous hybrids transgressed those of their parent species. The transgressions included fruit yield increases and other genetic gains in the twentieth century that sparked the global expansion of strawberry production. The importance of heterosis to the agricultural success of the hybrid species, however, has remained a mystery. Here we show that heterosis has disappeared (become fixed) among improved hybrids within a population (the California population) that has been under long-term selection for increased fruit yield, weight, and firmness. We found that the highest yielding hybrids are among the most highly inbred (59-79%), which seems counterintuitive for a highly heterozygous, outbreeder carrying heavy genetic loads. Although faint remnants of heterosis were discovered, the between-parent allele frequency differences and dispersed favorable dominant alleles necessary for heterosis have decreased nearly genome-wide within the California population. Conversely, heterosis was prevalent and significant among wide hybrids, especially for fruit count, a significant driver of genetic gains for fruit yield. We attributed the disappearance (fixation) of heterosis within the California population to increased homozygosity of favorable dominant alleles and inbreeding associated with selection, random genetic drift, and selective sweeps. Despite historical inbreeding, the highest yielding hybrids reported to-date are estimated to be heterozygous for 20,370-44,280 of 97,000-108,000 genes in the octoploid genome, the equivalent of an entire diploid genome or more.",

The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a widespread carnivore in California, USA, that until recently lacked robust demographic data. To facilitate a statewide abundance study, we created a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping panel for individual identification. For SNP discovery, we performed restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) on 78 samples collected throughout California and subsequently designed a panel of 96 SNPs for sequencing on a microfluidic platform. This panel includes loci to identify sex and differentiate bobcats from other common carnivores. The panel reliably differentiates individuals when using DNA extracted from feces, with 89% of samples amplifying at > 90% of SNPs. Importantly, we found autosomal SNPs were monomorphic in the closely related Canada lynx (L. canadensis) suggesting the panel would still be effective for bobcat study in areas of sympatry. Fecal genotyping provides a cost-effective, noninvasive method for population monitoring and detecting individual movement. Our panel generates standardized genotypes that can be analyzed across laboratories and used for continued bobcat monitoring in California and other western states.",

Furthermore, the occurrence of mutations conferring resistance to QoI and SDHI fungicides within an Alternaria population isolated from citrus was investigated. In field trials, high frequencies of Alternaria infections were observed on the stem end and stylar end of Satsuma and Shiranui mandarins, with a higher prevalence of stem-end infections. Fungicide treatments applied towards the end of the season effectively reduced the frequency of latent infections on the stem end, indicating that such infections occur during this period under specific conditions. While some fungicide treatments demonstrated efficacy in reducing fruit drop caused by Alternaria rot, the results varied across different orchards and years. Latent infections on fruits persisted at high frequencies in the majority of trials, highlighting the complex nature of disease management. Mutations associated with resistance against QoI and SDHI fungicides were identified within the Alternaria population affecting California citrus. Our study suggests the potential need for fungicide sprays at the onset of the season to reduce the frequency of Alternaria infections on the stem end and stylar end of fruits. However, the observed non-correlation or low correlation between latent infections and fruit drop indicates that latent infections alone cannot reliably predict fruit drop. Our findings indicate that pre-harvest fungicide treatments have inconsistent efficacy and are cost-effective only during unpredictable disease outbreaks.",

Previous studies have noted difficulties in determining the sequence of dsRNA molecules that have affected studies of immune function and estimates of viral diversity in nature. DMSO has been used to denature dsRNA prior to the reverse-transcription stage to improve reverse transcriptase PCR and Sanger sequencing. We systematically tested the utility of DMSO to improve the sequencing yield of a dsRNA virus (Φ6) in a short-read next-generation sequencing platform. DMSO treatment improved sequencing read recovery by over two orders of magnitude, even when RNA and cDNA concentrations were below the limit of detection. We also tested the effects of DMSO on a mock eukaryotic viral community and found that dsRNA virus reads increased with DMSO treatment. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DMSO treatment does not adversely affect recovery of reads from a ssRNA viral genome (influenza A/California/07/2009). We suggest that up to 50 % DMSO treatment be used prior to cDNA synthesis when samples of interest are composed of or may contain dsRNA.",

      "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.1/BA.1.1) variant was declared a variant of concern (VOC) on November 26, 2021 and rapidly became the dominant lineage globally. Monitoring for VOCs is a public health priority, but standard case-based surveillance requires a robust, local whole genome sequencing (WGS) network and results may take weeks. Wastewater monitoring of VOCs is appealing as a potentially sensitive and timely approach to VOC monitoring that could provide complementary information to case-based WGS and a more complete picture of VOC circulation. However, wastewater VOC monitoring through PCR assays and WGS each have unique advantages and disadvantages that are not well characterized. The California Department of Public Health collaborated with academic partners to conduct wastewater VOC monitoring during the emergence of Omicron BA.1./BA.1.1 in late 2021. Wastewater monitoring was conducted via RT-PCR assays targeting specific mutations and via wastewater sequencing. Wastewater data was analyzed within the context of case-based WGS data to track the emergence of Omicron in California. In most locations across California, wastewater PCR provided early identification of the emergence and subsequent dominance of Omicron BA.1./BA.1.1. These results were then corroborated and confirmed as case-based WGS results became available. These data helped guide real-time public health response during the Omicron surge. Wastewater monitoring of VOC's provides a timely, accurate, and sensitive methodology for VOC monitoring. Successful implementation of wastewater VOC monitoring requires wastewater surveillance infrastructure as well as ongoing investment and research to support the development and deployment of assays and sequencing methodologies for emerging variants.",

      "abstract": "California, USA, is home to 3 subspecies of North American elk (Cervus canadensis): Roosevelt (C. c. roosevelti), Rocky Mountain (C. c. nelsoni), and tule (C. c. nannodes). Effective management requires a baseline understanding of each subspecies' range, admixture zones, and geographic patterns of genetic diversity. To address these questions, we genotyped 1,271 individual elk from California (n = 1,204) and reference populations of Rocky Mountain and Roosevelt elk from Nevada (n = 32) and Oregon (n = 35), USA. Using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, we detected admixture between Roosevelt and Rocky Mountain elk at a contact zone in northern California, and between Roosevelt and tule elk in north-coastal California and central-coastal California. We identified a genetically distinct population of Roosevelt elk in northwestern California, likely reflecting the remnant population that survived a large demographic decline from overhunting during the 1800s. Tule elk exhibited lower levels of heterozygosity (0.44 ± 0.03 [SD]) and allelic richness (2.9 ± 0.2) than Rocky Mountain (0.58 ± 0.05, 4.9 ± 0.4, respectively) and Roosevelt (0.50 ± 0.06, 4.4 ± 0.6, respectively) elk. Among tule elk populations, heterozygosity varied, with the lowest heterozygosity (0.23 ± 0.05) corresponding to the oldest enclosed herd used over the past century as a source of translocations. Among tule elk populations, genetic structure revealed several cases of successful and unsuccessful reintroduction or augmentation attempts. Results provide an essential baseline for future monitoring and decisions about harvest management, translocations to preserve genetic diversity, and landscape-level conservation planning to maintain, enhance, or obstruct connectivity of elk populations. Genome-wide sequencing and analyses are needed to quantify inbreeding absolutely and assess genetic load and the age of admixture where subspecies currently exchange genes.",

      "abstract": "<jats:title/>\n               <jats:p>Background: Air pollution is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes in the general population such as asthma exacerbations, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and stroke. There is a strong association between air pollution and mechanistic processes associated with oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, and inflammation, suggesting a high risk of exposure for those with sickle cell disease (SCD). A small number of published studies have explored this relationship, primarily focusing on children. Only two studies have examined air pollution in the US, both with outcomes among urban area hospitals in Atlanta, GA. None have taken place in California, which has the worst air quality, including the four most polluted cities in year-round particle pollution in the nation. Additionally, all published studies have overlooked more rural exposure areas. Recent advances in environmental exposure assessment have enabled high-resolution predictions of ambient air pollution concentrations in the whole US, making it possible to cover unmonitored suburban and rural areas that were unrepresented in the past. In addition, these high-resolution predictions are more precise surrogates of the personal exposure measures than monitored data. Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5) is the most harmful pollutant based on current research findings. We hypothesized that short term increases in PM 2.5 exposure were associated with an increased risk for hospitalization among individuals with SCD in California.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods: We designed a time-stratified case-crossover study to estimate the percent change in risk for hospitalization for SCD complications associated with each 1mg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 exposure. The zip code of residence was used to spatially link each hospital admission with PM 2.5 exposure using a novel hybrid exposure model allowing for estimated exposure in areas without direct remote sensing. We used conditional logistic regressions to examine the PM 2.5 exposures at 7-day moving average and single lag days (from lag 0 to 6 days) before admission, adjusting for nonlinear confounding effects of air temperature and humidity at the same exposure window. We examined risk for all hospitalizations and specifically for vaso-occlusive pain (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: From 2000-2016, among 5,835 California residents with SCD, there were 107,450 admissions for sickle cell disease complications with VOC being the most common indication (71.1%). PM 2.5 air pollution data was examined among 2,634 zip codes throughout the state. Residents with SCD were noted to be living among 1,180 zip codes. The daily burden of PM 2.5 was higher in zip codes with residents with SCD (mean 11.5 mg/m 3, standard deviation [SD] 9.0) when compared to zip codes without residents known to have SCD (mean 9.2 mg/m 3, SD 8.6, p&amp;lt;0.001) ( Table 1). Overall, the mean daily burden of PM 2.5 declined in the period of 2010-2016 when compared to that from 2000-2009. However, the daily mean PM 2.5 concentration remained higher in zip codes with individuals with SCD. No significant association was seen in examining the week-long exposure to PM 2.5 and increase risk in hospitalizations for any indication over the entire study period (2000-2016). However, when examining the more contemporary period of 2010-2016, we identified that each 1mg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 was associated with 0.22% increased risk for SCD hospitalization (Confidence Interval [CI] 0.02-0.42, p=0.03) 3 days prior to admission. We observed a 0.26% increased risk for hospitalization for VOC with each 1 mg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 exposure (CI 0.02-0.49, p=0.03) at lag day 3 (Figure 1). No effect was seen with PM 2.5 on hospitalizations for ACS during any time period.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Discussion: Our study suggests that short term air pollution exposure may be a trigger for hospitalization for individuals with SCD. In particular this effect is seen in the more recent years with a lower daily average PM 2.5 burden overall, suggesting attention may be needed well below Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) thresholds. Consistent with previous studies, lag day 3 PM 2.5 exposure is associated with an increased risk for hospitalization for VOC. These results may have important implications in understanding risk factors for hospitalization for children and adults with SCD.</jats:p>",

Yet none has considered the tour in musical terms, nor taken into account Spanish reaction. Drawing on coverage in the Republican press, along with recent work on vocality and identity, I argue that the tour challenged prior notions of blackness in Spain. Spanish journalists addressed Robeson’s singing from the standpoint of the ‘suspect whiteness of Spain’ (to borrow Fra-Molinero’s apt description) while Robeson himself linked blackness and flamenco and reformulated the ‘sorrow song,’ as W. E. B. Du Bois called the spiritual. I also analyse Robeson’s performances of ‘Ol’ Man River’ from the musical Show Boat in terms of Republic ideology. In sum, Robeson challenged Franco’s vision of ‘blood purity’ (limpieza de sangre) while calling for racial justice worldwide.",

      "abstract": "PROBLEM: Academic medical centers struggle with the high cost of care, reduced reimbursement, intense competition, and low profit margins. Many factors, including a high proportion of publicly insured patients, a model rewarding procedural specialties, and research and educational support burden, led to faculty salary inequities, physician disengagement, and difficulty recruiting. APPROACH: UC Davis Health implemented an aligned funds flow model in July 2021 to create a mission-aligned model in which all departments had financial margins to optimize recruitment, retention, research, and teaching. OUTCOMES: The 3-year experience (academic years 2021-2024) with this model at UC Davis Health was characterized by physician compensation, physician recruitment, and profit increases. Total collections for departments increased by 4% in the first year, 0.2% in the second year, and 11.3% in the third year of funds flow. Total productivity increased by 4.9% during the first year, 3.6% during the second year, and 8.4% during the third year. Salaries increased in all departmental categories in year 3. Productivity and collections per faculty member increased during the first year and were stable during the second and third years. Parity among procedural, primary care, and hospital-based service lines was improved because departmental revenue was agnostic to payer mix and hospital agreements were more formulaic. The hospital contribution to funds flow increased from $67 million in 2022 to $101 million in 2024. NEXT STEPS: Regular communication and transparency are critical to ongoing trust and success with implementation of sustaining funds flow. The new model resulted in improved physician compensation and increased hiring. However, the implementation of funds flow had a negative fiscal effect on the academic medical center, and sustainability may require fine-tuning to balance affordability. The authors plan to convert outpatient primary care to productivity-based models and decrease time-limited support for new faculty from 2 years to 1 year.",

      "abstract": "Norton culture (ca. 740 BC–AD 1000) sites are ubiquitous across the western Arctic. Based on artifact and settlement data, it is generally agreed that Norton culture south of Seward Peninsula possessed a mixed marine-focused economy dominated by seasonally available Pacific salmon. However, the few direct studies of Norton subsistence, thus far, have suggested an emphasis on marine mammals rather than salmon. We present the results of a zooarchaeological midden analysis from the large Norton site of Difchahak (49-NOB-005) near Shaktoolik on Norton Sound, Alaska. We argue the faunal remains recovered from this site reflect its local estuarine system. Inhabitants were able to maintain year-round occupation of the region through an expansion of netting technology to non-salmon prey species. The economic focus at Difchahak was on mass capture of several seasonally available taxa, including salmon, mussels, saffron cod, ptarmigan, ducks, geese, and seal. Comparison of these faunal remains to those from Norton culture deposits at the neighboring site of Iyatayet suggests that differences between the localities are largely driven by geographically dependent prey-species distributions, and these two sites may represent complementary parts to a broad logistical foraging system.",

      "abstract": "Artifact and settlement data suggest that precolonial subsistence strategies in northwestern Alaska went through an economic transition with increased importance placed on local fish and small game between AD 1400 and AD 1500. From a North American Arctic perspective, this process has been defined as “regionalization.” Here, we present results from a zooarchaeological analysis of over 31,700 faunal remains from the Shaktoolik Airport Site (NOB-072), a large multicomponent precolonial village site adjacent to the Native Village of Shaktoolik in Norton Sound, Alaska. Faunal specimens were derived from 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) screened and bulk sediment samples taken from midden deposits generated during two distinct archaeological or cultural phases from AD 1280 to the mid-1800s: 1) Nukleet, a regional variant of the Western Thule culture, and 2) three chronological periods associated with precolonial Yup’ik occupations. Comparison among archaeological deposits indicates that faunal assemblage composition varies spatially across the site and likely represents discrete seasonal activity areas. Faunal remains from bulk sediment samples also highlight the importance of small forage fish and shellfish, further emphasizing the need for sampling sites using fine-mesh screening. Based on our analysis, precolonial Yup’ik subsistence strategies diversified around AD 1500, coinciding with a broader regionalization trend. This shift may have been in response to the onset of the Little Ice Age (AD 1500–1850), but it could also have been in response to demographic pressure from increased regional populations.",

Louis Giddings in his excavation trench in 1948. Findings reveal that saffron cod and salmonberries were a crucial resource. Although these food items have low caloric yields, we argue that both provide essential nutrients to supplement marine-mammal dominant diets. Drawing on ethnographic accounts, we argue that saffron cod were crucial fallback resources, likely harvested by women and were relied on in times of resource scarcity. These data shed novel insight into Thule coastal subsistence strategies, which may otherwise be overlooked when the focus is on analysis of tool technologies or on unscreened faunal samples. Future research requires additional processing of sediment samples to fully understand the role of small-bodied fauna and plant foods to Thule subsistence strategies.",

Using remote sensing, we constrain the timing of stream discoloration to the last 10 years, a period of rapid warming and snowfall, suggesting impairment is likely due to permafrost thaw. Thawing permafrost can foster chemical weathering of minerals, microbial reduction of soil iron, and groundwater transport of metals to streams. Compared to clear reference streams, orange streams have lower pH, higher turbidity, and higher sulfate, iron, and trace metal concentrations, supporting sulfide mineral weathering as a primary mobilization process. Stream discoloration was associated with dramatic declines in macroinvertebrate diversity and fish abundance. These findings have considerable implications for drinking water supplies and subsistence fisheries in rural Alaska.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To perform a multicenter study to assess growth failure in hospitalized infants with gastroschisis. STUDY DESIGN: This study included neonates with gastroschisis within sites in the University of California Fetal Consortium. The study's primary outcome was growth failure at hospital discharge, defined as a weight or length z score decrease >0.8 from birth. Regression analysis was performed to assess changes in z scores over time. RESULTS: Among 125 infants with gastroschisis, the median gestational age was 37 weeks (IQR 35-37). Length of stay was 32 days (23-60); 55% developed weight or length growth failure at discharge (28% had weight growth failure, 42% had length growth failure, and 15% had both weight and length growth failure). Weight and length z scores at 14 days, 30 days, and discharge were less than birth (P < .01 for all). Weight and length z scores declined from birth to 30 days (-0.10 and -0.11 z score units/week, respectively, P < .001). Length growth failure at discharge was associated with weight and length z score changes over time (P < .05 for both). Lower gestational age was associated with weight growth failure (OR 0.70 for each gestational age week, 95% CI 0.55-0.89, P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Growth failure, in particular linear growth failure, is common in infants with gastroschisis. These data suggest the need to improve nutritional management in these infants.",

      "abstract": "Background Prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease has been associated with early-term delivery and cesarean delivery (CD). We implemented a multi-institutional standardized clinical assessment and management plan (SCAMP) through the University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium. Our objective was to decrease early-term (37-39 weeks) delivery and CD in pregnancies complicated by fetal congenital heart disease using a SCAMP methodology to improve practice in a high-risk and clinically complex setting. Methods and Results University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium site-specific management decisions were queried following SCAMP implementation. This contemporary intervention group was compared with a University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium historical cohort. Primary outcomes were early-term delivery and CD. A total of 496 maternal-fetal dyads with prenatally diagnosed congenital heart disease were identified, 185 and 311 in the historical and intervention cohorts, respectively. Recommendation for later delivery resulted in a later gestational age at delivery (38.9 versus 38.1 weeks, P=0.01). After adjusting for maternal age and site, historical controls were more likely to have a CD (odds ratio [OR],1.8; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P=0.004) and more likely (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3) to have an early-term delivery than the intervention group. Vaginal delivery was recommended in 77% of the cohort, resulting in 61% vaginal deliveries versus 50% in the control cohort (P=0.03). Among pregnancies with major cardiac lesions (n=373), vaginal birth increased from 51% to 64% (P=0.008) and deliveries ≥39 weeks increased from 33% to 48% (P=0.004). Conclusions Implementation of a SCAMP decreased the rate of early-term deliveries and CD for prenatal congenital heart disease. Development of clinical pathways may help standardize care, decrease maternal risk secondary to CD, improve neonatal outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs.",

All targets were quantified in influent, secondary-treated effluent, and tertiary-treated effluent at the University of California, Davis Wastewater Treatment Plant (UCDWWTP) over 11 weeks. We established an FVM-gating boundary for VLPs using bacteriophages T4 and ϕ6 as well as four phages isolated from wastewater. We then utilize T4 alongside three submicron beads as quality controls in the FVM assay. Coliphage was measured by standard plaque assays, and genome copies of PMMoV, CrAss, and ToBRFV were measured by digital droplet (dd)PCR. FVM results for wastewater revealed distinct microbial profiles at each treatment stage. However, correlations between VLPs and targeted viruses were poor. Trends for virus inactivation and removal, observed for targeted viruses during wastewater treatment, were consistent with expectations. Conversely, VLP counts were elevated in the WWTP effluent relative to the influent. Additional sampling revealed a decrease in VLP counts during the filtration treatment step following secondary treatment but a substantial increase in VLPs following ultraviolet disinfection. Defining application boundaries remain crucial to ensuring meaningful data interpretation as flow cytometry and virometry take on greater significance in water quality monitoring.",

We aimed to determine the proportion of NIHF cases in which the etiology was clearly determined in a large, contemporary, and diverse cohort, as well as to describe the etiologies with a focus on genetic causes. METHODS: Retrospective review of NIHF cases between 2015 and 2017 from the five University of California Fetal-Maternal Consortium sites. Singleton pregnancies with prenatally diagnosed NIHF were included, and cases with maternal alloimmunization were excluded. Cases were categorized as being of confirmed, suspected, or unknown etiology. RESULTS: Sixty-five NIHF cases were identified. Forty-six percent (30/65) remained of unknown etiology, while 9.2% (6/65) had a suspected etiology and 44.6% (29/65) were of confirmed etiology. Among confirmed cases, 11 resulted from aneuploidy; 7 from fetal structural anomalies; 2 each from fetal arrhythmia, Noonan syndrome, and generalized lymphatic dysplasia; and 1 each from arthrogryposis, parvovirus, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, fetal goiter, and Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. CONCLUSION: In this contemporary, multicenter study, the cause of prenatally diagnosed NIHF was confirmed in only 44% of cases, and a genetic etiology was found in only 25% of those that received standard of care genetic testing.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the interlinkages between ecological conditions and mariculture practices are vital for enhancing growth performance and nutritional profiling of marine bivalves. However, highly productive mariculture practices under different local ecological conditions have not been comprehensively documented to achieve sustainable outcomes. This study investigates how depth (0.5 m, 1 m, and 1.5 m) and site-specific ecological factors of three farming sites (Moheshkhali, Khurushkul, and Choufaldandi) influence the growth performance and nutritional profile of green mussels (Perna viridis) in floating raft mariculture systems in the southeast coast of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. For this purpose, 20 uniform green mussel spats (2.9 ± 0.08 g) were inoculated across three cultivation depths in ten replicated mussel net socks, which were suspended vertically in the water column from horizontal floating rafts and cultured for six months (October-March) at the above-mentioned three farming sites. Among environmental factors, the two-way ANOVA model displayed both depth- and site-specific significant variation of ecological parameters (DO, salinity, turbidity, NO3-N, PO4-P, Chlorophyll-a) and food availability (Coscinodiscophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, and Dinophyceae) in the studied areas. Our findings based on the two-way ANOVA model also revealed that both the depth and site-specific ecological settings significantly impact (p < 0.05) growth performance, shell morphometry and nutritional profiles of green mussels. Various univariate and multivariate analyses further revealed that the above ecological factors are closely interlinked with the observed differences in growth performance and nutritional profiles of mussels. By integrating these ecological and environmental variables, our study provides actionable insights for optimizing green mussel farming practices, potentially leading to improved yield and nutritional quality in floating raft systems.",

      "abstract": "Bangladesh, with its diverse coastal and marine ecosystems, holds immense potential to harness low-trophic extractive mariculture (LTEM) as a key component of its sustainable blue economy. Considering the present national interest, this study provides a comprehensive assessment of the current status of LTEM in Bangladesh, identifying its challenges and offers strategic interventions for future development. Using a mixed-method approach, the research integrates an extensive literature review, key informant interviews, field research experiences, and stakeholder workshops involving policymakers, industry leaders, academia, NGOs, and community representatives. Based on the synthesized information, key challenges were broadly classified into four categories, which were further sub-divided into several thematic issues, including eight for technical, five for environment, five for socio-economic, and two for regulatory and policy constraints, revealing systemic inefficiencies such as poor suitability mapping, technological limitation, weak value chains, poor coordination among stakeholders, and insufficient research investment. These issues contribute to knowledge gaps, coastal hydro-dynamics conditions, inconsistent practices, and hinder the development of effective regulatory frameworks, limiting market access, product quality, and export potential. In response, twelve thematic intervention areas were identified, which were further refined during plenary discussions in the workshops to form a detailed roadmap for the period 2025–2035. The roadmap outlines a series of sequential actions and identifies key actors for each of the twelve thematic areas, with an emphasis on addressing the barriers to LTEM development. By shifting from a project-focused approach to a systems-oriented strategy, the framework integrates stakeholder perspectives and lessons learned to strengthen Bangladesh's LTEM sector.",

Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 158 semi-intensive shrimp farmers from Bangladesh's Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat districts. Type-based data analysis was done. We used Spearman's rank correlation and multiple linear regression. Only 35% of respondents said that they knew the health safety of chemicals and pesticides used in semi-intensive shrimp farms and that safety training is needed, and all farmers wanted to attend when available. At least 74% of farmers used masks when handling pesticides, fertilizers, and chemicals. 40.50% of farmers used protective clothing, 91% cleansed their hands, legs, and face after each day's work, and 94% felt that sanitization reduces pesticide, fertilizer, and chemical pollution. A significant positive correlation coefficient was established in KAP. Education significantly increased knowledge. Practices varied with health and safety training. Results suggest that attitudes determine practices, where knowledge is significantly associated with attitudes. A comprehensive health safety and hygiene training program for all shrimp farmers should be developed to raise awareness, reduce illness outbreaks, and preserve healthy living.",

      "abstract": "PREMISE: Quantifying how closely related plant species differ in susceptibility to insect herbivory is important for understanding the variation in evolutionary pressures on plant functional traits. However, empirically measuring in situ variation in herbivory spanning the geographic range of a plant-insect complex is logistically difficult. Recently, new methods have been developed using herbarium specimens to investigate patterns in plant-insect symbioses across large geographic scales. Such investigations provide insights into how accelerated anthropogenic changes may impact plant-insect interactions that are of ecological or agricultural importance. METHODS: Here, we analyze 274 pressed herbarium samples to investigate variation in herbivory damage in 13 different species of the economically important plant genus Cucurbita (Cucurbitaceae). This collection is composed of specimens of wild, undomesticated Cucurbita that were collected from across their native range, and Cucurbita cultivars collected from both within their native range and from locations where they have been introduced for agriculture in temperate North America. RESULTS: Herbivory is common on individuals of all Cucurbita species collected throughout their geographic ranges. However, estimates of herbivory varied considerably among individuals, with mesophytic species accruing more insect damage than xerophytic species, and wild specimens having more herbivory than specimens collected from human-managed habitats. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that long-term evolutionary changes in habitat from xeric to mesic climates and wild to human-managed habitats may mediate the levels of herbivory pressure from coevolved herbivores. Future investigations into the potential factors that contribute to herbivory may inform the management of domesticated crop plants and their insect herbivores.",

One subspecies, the Ivallda Arctic (O. c. ivallda), is endemic to California's Sierra Nevada and of particular biogeographic interest and conservation concern. Extreme alpine habitats occupied by this subspecies include the summit of Mt. Whitney, California, representing the highest elevation butterfly population in North America. The assembly presented here consists of two haplotypes, 738.92 and 770.85 Mb in length, with contig N50 values of 10.49 and 10.13 Mb, scaffold N50 values of 25.35 and 25.69 Mb, scaffold L50 values of 13 and 14, and BUSCO completeness scores of 96.5 and 98.3%, respectively. More than 97% of the assembly is organized into 29 scaffolds, which likely represent whole chromosomes. This assembly is the first major genomic resource for Oeneis, providing a foundational reference for future genomic studies on the taxonomy, evolutionary history, and conservation of the genus. As part of the California Conservation Genomics Project, we will use this assembly in conjunction with short-read resequencing to resolve patterns of evolutionary differentiation, adaptive genomic variation, and gene flow among remaining O. c. ivallda populations. These data can and will be used to inform the subspecies' conservation as warming climatic conditions continue to lead to the loss and fragmentation of alpine habitats. We also provide genome assemblies for the O. chryxus mitochondrion and a Wolbachia endosymbiont.",

Subjects with a prenatal diagnosis of severe fetal central nervous system ventriculomegaly were recruited and followed longitudinally. Maternal events around the delivery of fetuses with AS were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven subjects with fetal AS confirmed by neonatal neuroimaging were analyzed. The average gestational age at delivery was 36.7 weeks. Overall, 86% were delivered by CS, and 62% of these were elective. Ninety-one percent of CSs were performed through a Pfannenstiel abdominal incision. A classical uterine incision was required in 13% of cesarean deliveries. The peripartum complication rate was 27%. CONCLUSION: Women carrying a fetus with AS were at risk for preterm birth, cesarean delivery, a classical uterine incision, and peripartum complications.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A critical component of an evidence-based reassessment of in-utero intervention for fetal aqueductal stenosis (fetal AS) is determining if the prenatal diagnosis can be accurately made at a gestational age amenable to in-utero intervention. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted through the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet). Pregnancies complicated by severe central nervous system (CNS) ventriculomegaly (lateral ventricle diameter &gt;15 mm) not secondary to a primary diagnosis (myelomeningocele, encephalocele, etc.) were recruited at diagnosis. Imaging and laboratory findings were recorded in an online REDCap database. After evaluation, investigators were asked to render their degree of confidence in the diagnosis of fetal AS. The prenatal diagnosis was compared to the postnatal diagnosis obtained through neonatal neuroimaging. Performance characteristics of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were calculated, as was the mean gestational age at diagnosis. RESULTS: Between April 2015 and October 2022, eleven NAFTNet centers contributed 64 subjects with severe fetal CNS ventriculomegaly. Of these, 56 had both prenatal and postnatal diagnoses recorded. Ultrasound revealed 32 fetal AS true positives, 4 false positives, 7 false negatives, and 13 true negatives, rendering a sensitivity of 0.82, a specificity of 0.76, a positive predictive value of 0.89, and a negative predictive value of 0.65. The mean gestational age at diagnosis by ultrasound was 25.5 weeks (std +/- 4.7 weeks). The proportion of agreement (true positive + true negative/n) was highest at 24 weeks gestation. For fetal MRI (n = 35), the sensitivity for fetal AS was 0.95, specificity was 0.69, positive predictive value was 0.84, and negative predictive value was 0.90. MRI was performed at 25 weeks on average. CONCLUSION: The prenatal diagnosis of fetal AS can be made with accuracy at a gestational age potentially amenable to in-utero intervention. Only 7% of subjects were incorrectly diagnosed prenatally with fetal AS by ultrasound and 11% by MRI. Diagnostic accuracy of fetal AS will likely improve with increased experience.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the timing of weed emergence is crucial to effective management. Management practices implemented too early may fail to completely control late-emerging seedlings, whereas management practices implemented too late will suffer from low efficacy. Weed emergence times reflect biological factors, such as seed dormancy and germination requirements, as well as environmental conditions. We conducted a systematic review of studies that developed models to predict weed emergence temporal patterns. We screened 1,854 studies, 98 of which were included in the final dataset. Most of the studies included were conducted in North America (51%) or Europe (30%). A wide variety of weed species (102) and families (21) were included, and many studies modeled several weeds. Grass weeds (Poaceae) were modeled most frequently (83 instances). Most weeds (40%) had base temperature values between 0 and 5 C, and 38% had base water potential ranging from -1.0 to -0.5 MPa. Most studies used empirical parametric models, such as Weibull (40%) or Gompertz (30%) models. Nonparametric and mechanistic models were also represented. Models varied in their biological and environmental data requirements. In general, empirical parametric models based on hydrothermal time (i.e., time above base temperature and water potential thresholds) represented a good balance between ease of use and prediction accuracy. Soft computing approaches such as artificial neural networks demonstrated substantial potential in situations with complex emergence patterns and limited data availability, although they (soft computing approaches) can be susceptible to overfitting. Our study also demonstrated variability in model performance and limited generalizability across species and regions. This finding underscores the need for context-specific and well-validated weed emergence models to inform management, especially in the context of climate change.",

      "abstract": "\"Neurophobia\" is a phenomenon in human medical education where students develop negative attitudes towards neurology, impeding student learning and future clinical practice. While suspected to exist in veterinary medical education, it remains unstudied. The main objectives of this study were to examine North American veterinary student attitudes towards neurology and neurology education and explore elements that might contribute to neurophobia. Additional objectives were to evaluate veterinary educators' perceptions of student neurophobia and to develop and validate a scoring tool (VetNeuroQ) to quantify veterinary neurophobia. Veterinary students and faculty at North American veterinary schools were surveyed. A scoring tool was developed from a subset of questions and validated using confirmatory factor analysis. Six hundred six anonymous responses were collected from students at all stages of veterinary education. Neurology training was reported as insufficient by 35.9% and most respondents perceived neurology to not be easy to learn. Neuroanatomy/physiology and neurolocalization were considered difficult concepts. Students rated low confidence in neurology (vs. other topics), and low interest in the Neurology/Neurosurgery specialty. 61.7% of educators reported neurophobia amongst their students. The proposed VetNeuroQ scale showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha >0.7) and validity (p < .05; CFI >0.9, RMSEA <0.08). VetNeuroQ scores were low but improved over the course of veterinary education. These findings demonstrate low self-efficacy, interest, and confidence, along with perceptions of difficulty, amongst veterinary students, consistent with neurophobia. Contributing elements are discussed. The VetNeuroQ scale allows quantification of veterinary student neurophobia and may be useful for screening students and assessing the impact of educational interventions.",

Developing strategies for equitable representation of diverse populations in sub-city wastewater sampling frameworks is complicated by misalignment between demographic data and sampling zones. We address this challenge by: (1) developing a geospatial analysis tool that probabilistically assigns demographic data for subgroups aggregated by race and age from census blocks to sub-city sampling zones; (2) evaluating representativeness of subgroup populations for COVID-19 wastewater-based disease surveillance in Davis, California; and (3) demonstrating scenario planning that prioritizes vulnerable populations. We monitored SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater as a proxy for COVID-19 incidence in Davis (November 2021-September 2022). Daily city-wide sampling and thrice-weekly sub-city sampling from 16 maintenance holes covered nearly the entire city population. Sub-city wastewater data, aggregated as a population-weighted mean, correlated strongly with centralized treatment plant data (Spearman's correlation 0.909). Probabilistic assignment of demographic data can inform decisions when adapting sampling locations to prioritize vulnerable groups. We considered four scenarios that reduced the number of sampling zones from baseline by 25% and 50%, chosen randomly or to prioritize coverage of >65-year-old populations. Prioritizing representation increased coverage of >65-year-olds from 51.1% to 67.2% when removing half the zones, while increasing coverage of Black or African American populations from 67.5% to 76.7%. Downscaling had little effect on correlations between sub-city and centralized data (Spearman's correlations ranged from 0.875 to 0.917), with strongest correlations observed when prioritizing coverage of >65-year-old populations.",

However, a close examination of the publications produced by the Russian and British missions to its ruler, Ya'qub Beg, militates against interpreting these missions as merely another episode of the Great Game, the century-long struggle for influence in Central and High Asia. Rather, Russian and British diplomats and travellers participated in a common culture of exploration, sharing a purpose and a European identity. This self-identification, in turn, was closely connected with the practice of exploration: objective measurement and scientific inquiry were coded as activities differentiating Russian and British travellers from the objects of their study.

Nowadays, δ15N/δ18O-NO3- combined with a Bayesian-based SIAR model are widely used to identify riverine nitrate sources. However, little is known regarding the effect of variations in pollution source isotopic composition on nitrate source contributions. Herein, we used δ15N/δ18O-NO3-, SIAR modeling, probability statistical analysis and a perturbing method to quantify the contributions and uncertainties of riverine nitrate sources in the Wen-Rui Tang River of China and to further investigate the model sensitivity of each nitrate source. The SIAR model confirmed municipal sewage (MS) as the major nitrate source (58.5-75.7%). Nitrogen fertilizer (NF, 8.6-20.9%) and soil nitrogen (SN, 7.8-20.1%) were also identified as secondary nitrate sources, while atmospheric deposition (AD, <0.1-7.9%) was a minor source. Uncertainties associated with NF (UI90 = 0.32) and SN (UI90 = 0.30) were high, whereas those associated with MS (UI90 = 0.14) were moderate and AD low (UI90 = 0.0087). A sensitivity analysis was performed for the SIAR modeling and indicated that the isotopic composition of the predominant source (i.e., MS in this study) had the strongest effect on the overall riverine nitrate source apportionment results.",

      "abstract": "China has experienced a rapid period of urbanization since the 1980s. Many traditional agricultural areas were transformed into the urban-rural transitional areas, in which both urban and rural characteristics exist. Non-point source pollution (NPSP) has become a major side effect of urbanization and agricultural production which caused wide public concerns. It is crucial to carry out research on identifying the spatiotemporal variation in NPSP in the urban-rural transitional area (especially in developing countries, e.g., in China), which is a prerequisite for improving water quality and guiding NPSP control efforts. Modeling approaches are great tools to provide quantitative information on NPSP and optimize the best management practices for NPSP control. We reviewed over twenty years of publications on NPSP modeling and applications in urban, rural and its transitional areas. The strengths and limitations of 20 commonly used NPSP models in China were concluded based on a brief introduction and the evolution history. Reporting the strengths and weaknesses of each NPSP model could enhance its utility in practice. In terms of the unique characteristics of urban-rural transitional areas, which are neither strictly urban nor rural, non-point source pollutants are often distinctly different between traditional pollutants from urban and agricultural areas since the great differences in the hydrological processes, and none of existing NPSP models are fully applicable to urban-rural transitional areas. Based on limited NPSP modeling studies in urban-rural transitional areas, the existing research insufficiency were technical and mechanism limitations of the model despite of numerous improvements in the past, concerns about simulation accuracy, limited investigations on new pollutants, and lack of monitoring data. Future development trend and concerns of NPSP models for urban-rural transitional areas were discussed, which could be of great help to the development of NPSP models and their applications in water quality management in the rapid urbanized China.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterize the effect of embolic particle size on outcomes of uterine artery embolization (UAE) for mixed adenomyosis/fibroids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective database was compiled of all patients with mixed adenomyosis/fibroids who underwent UAE with microspheres (Embosphere [Merit Medical, South Jordan, Utah] and Embozene [Varian, Palo Alto, California]) from September 2015 to May 2022 (n = 76; mean age, 46.7 years [standard deviation {SD} ± 5.7]). Demographic, clinical, imaging, procedural, and follow-up data were collected. Intraprocedurally, initial particle size was chosen according to proceduralist judgment and subsequently upsized as needed until near-stasis was achieved. Initial particle size was categorized as either small (Embosphere 300-500 μm and Embozene 500 μm) or large (Embosphere 500-700 μm and Embozene 700 μm). The effect of initial particle size on patient-reported symptomatic improvement was assessed with logistic regression, with preprocedural uterine volume, presence of focal adenomyoma, and total number of vials of embolic material as regression covariates. RESULTS: Preprocedural symptoms included menorrhagia (89.5%), pelvic pain (53.9%), and bulk symptoms (60.5%). The baseline mean uterine volume was 748.5 mL (SD ± 543.9). Postprocedurally, 89.1%, 92.3%, and 97.4% reported improvement in menorrhagia, pelvic pain, and bulk symptoms, respectively. Initial embolic particle sizing was not significantly associated with patient-reported improvement in menorrhagia (P = .134), pelvic pain (P = .598), or bulk symptoms (P = .151), when controlling for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: When controlling for covariates, smaller-calibrated microspheres had similar postprocedural pain outcomes as larger particles, with similar target outcomes in UAE for mixed adenomyosis/fibroids.",

Scholars and policymakers alike have argued that disclosure will lead to greater social accountability—either reputational harm for firms revealing large disparities or benefit for more-egalitarian organizations. Yet little research has directly tested this central assumption. We advance understanding of this issue by examining reactions from a key constituency affected by pay gaps: employees. We analyze the existence, magnitude, and persistence of changes in employees’ public affective evaluations of their employers on the review site Glassdoor in the wake of pay gap disclosures prompted by new regulations in the United Kingdom. We find a short-lived improvement in employees’ evaluations of organizations reporting pay parity, consistent with a reputational boost. At the same time, we find little evidence of a negative post-disclosure reaction from employees of firms reporting sizable gender-based disparities. We take an abductive approach to investigate these surprising findings, probing key assumptions and the viability of different plausible explanations for the results. We consider how our empirical findings can inform the development of novel theory in the areas of gender wage inequality, reputation, and transparency.",

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the production performance and biochemical profile of sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) under three farming systems, namely floating long-line (FLL), off-bottom long-line (OBLL), and off-bottom net (OBN), and three site-specific (Khurushkul, Nuniachora, and Sonapara) ecological conditions for a period of nine months (October 2022 to June 2023). Depending on the site suitability for different cultivation systems, 15 plots (5 FLL, 5 OBLL, and 5 OBN) were established in Nuniachora, 10 plots (5 FLL, 5 OBLL) were established in Sonapara, and 5 plots (FLL) were established in Khurushkul of the Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh. Depending on the cultivation months, we partially harvested U. lactuca every 15–30 days once it reached 25–35 cm in length. Results showed that the gross weight biomass (GWB) of U. lactuca cultured in the FLL (F = 200.43, p < 0.001) cultivation system was 45.38% and 39.85% higher compared to OBN and OBLL, respectively. The average daily growth rate (DGR) was found to be 11%–13% higher in the FLL method (F = 236.11, p < 0.001). Location-based comparisons indicated a significantly higher (p < 0.05) U. lactuca production in Khurushkul, followed by the Nuniarchora, and the lowest was observed in Sonapara. Seasonality influenced the production performances of U. lactuca, with significantly higher (p < 0.05) growth observed from December to March due to favourable physio-chemical parameters. Multivariate analysis revealed that high salinity, pH, and nutrient concentrations positively influenced growth performances, while high temperature, turbidity, and total suspended solids (TSS) had negative effects. U. lactuca harvested from the FLL and OBN systems contained 14.3% and 9.44% higher amounts of protein (F = 36.77, p < 0.001) than the OBN system. The fatty acid analysis showed that U. lactuca from the FLL and OBN systems contained a significantly lower amount of saturated fatty acids but a higher amount of monounsaturated and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to the OBLL system. Among the heavy metals and minerals analyzed, U. lactuca harvested from the FLL system contained significantly (p < 0.05) higher amounts of Na and K and lower amounts of Pb, Cr, Co, and Fe. The findings of the present study underscore the superiority of the floating long-line cultivation system for U. lactuca, highlighting its potential for sustainable farming practices to address global food security and utilization in various industrial applications.",

Excessive quantities of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is a significant source of aquatic pollution, despite of their roles as essential nutritional elements for aquatic life processes. In this study, we present a new framework using random forest (RF) as a powerful machine learning algorithm driven by geo-datasets to estimate and map the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) at a spatial resolution for the Wen-Rui Tang River (WRTR) watershed, which is a typically urban-rural transitional area in east coastal region of China. A comprehensive GIS database of 26 in-house built environmental variables was adopted to build the predictive models of TN and TP in open waters over the watershed. The performances of the RF regression models were evaluated in comparison with in-situ measurements, and the results indicated the ability of RF regression models to accurately predict the spatiotemporal distribution of N and P concentration in rivers. Charactering the explanatory variable importance measures in the calibrated RF regression model defined the most significant variables impacting N and P contaminations in open waters across the urban-rural transitional area, and the results showed that these variables are aquaculture, direct domestic sewage, industrial wastewater discharges and the changing meteorological variables. Besides, mapping of the TN and TP concentrations across the continuous river at high spatiotemporal resolution (daily, 1 km × 1 km) in this study were informative. The results in this study provided the valuable data to various different stakeholders for managing water quality and pollution control where similar regions with rapid urbanization and a lack of water quality monitoring datasets.",

      "abstract": "Predation threat is a major driver of behavior in many prey species. Animals can recognize their relative risk of predation based on cues in the environment, including visual and/or chemical cues released by a predator or from its prey. When threat of predation is high, prey often respond by altering their behavior to reduce their probability of detection and/or capture. Here, we test how a clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), behaviorally responds to predation cues. We measured aggressive and social behaviors both under 'risk', where chemical cues from predatory fish and injured conspecifics were present, and control contexts (no risk cues present). We predicted that mollies would exhibit reduced aggression towards a simulated intruder and increased sociability under risk contexts as aggression might increase their visibility to a predator and shoaling should decrease their chance of capture through the dilution effect. As predicted, we found that Amazon mollies spent more time with a conspecific when risk cues were present, however they did not reduce their aggression. This highlights the general result of the 'safety in numbers' behavioral response that many small shoaling species exhibit, including these clonal fish, which suggests that mollies may view this response as a more effective anti-predator response compared to limiting their detectability by reducing aggressive conspecific interactions.",

      "abstract": "The last 12 months have provided further evidence of the potential for cascading ecological and socio-political crises that were warned of 12 months ago. Then a consensus statement from the Regional Action on Climate Change Symposium warned: \"the Earth's climatic, ecological, and human systems are converging towards a crisis that threatens to engulf global civilization within the lifetimes of children now living.\" Since then, the consequences of a broad set of extreme climate events (notably droughts, floods, and fires) have been compounded by interaction with impacts from multiple pandemics (including COVID-19 and cholera) and the Russia-Ukraine war. As a result, new connections are becoming visible between climate change and human health, large vulnerable populations are experiencing food crises, climate refugees are on the move, and the risks of water, food, and climate disruption have been visibly converging and compounding. Many vulnerable populations now face serious challenges to adapt. In light of these trends, this year, RACC identifies a range of measures to be taken at global and regional levels to bolster the resilience of these populations in the face of such emerging crises. In particular, at all scales, there is a need for globally available local data, reliable analytic techniques, community capacity to plan adaptation strategies, and the resources (scientific, technical, cultural, and economic) to implement them. To date, the rate of growth of the support for climate change resilience lags behind the rapid growth of cascading and converging risks. As an urgent message to COP27, it is proposed that the time is now right to devote much greater emphasis, global funding, and support to the increasing adaptation needs of vulnerable populations.",

      "abstract": "The premutation of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene is characterized by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeats (55 to 200 CGGs) in the 5' untranslated region and increased levels of FMR1 mRNA. Molecular mechanisms leading to fragile X-premutation-associated conditions (FXPAC) include cotranscriptional R-loop formations, FMR1 mRNA toxicity through both RNA gelation into nuclear foci and sequestration of various CGG-repeat-binding proteins, and the repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN)-initiated translation of potentially toxic proteins. Such molecular mechanisms contribute to subsequent consequences, including mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death. Clinically, premutation carriers may exhibit a wide range of symptoms and phenotypes. Any of the problems associated with the premutation can appropriately be called FXPAC. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), and fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND) can fall under FXPAC. Understanding the molecular and clinical aspects of the premutation of the FMR1 gene is crucial for the accurate diagnosis, genetic counseling, and appropriate management of affected individuals and families. This paper summarizes all the known problems associated with the premutation and documents the presentations and discussions that occurred at the International Premutation Conference, which took place in New Zealand in 2023.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Histologically evaluate damage to rabbit femur after the creation of bicortical 1.5-mm-diameter holes using a standard surgical drill bit, an acrylic drill bit, and a Kirschner wire (K-wire). METHODS: 10 femora (5 pairs) from skeletally mature female intact New Zealand white rabbits were used. The bone diaphyses were divided into 4 locations, systematically undergoing each test (surgical drill bit, acrylic drill bit, K-wire, and intact control). Four pairs were drilled using a mechanical testing machine, and 1 pair was drilled by hand. Cross-sections of the bone were stained en bloc with basic fuchsin for undecalcified histological evaluation. Damaged bone was reported as a percentage of a standardized area and categorized by location (cis- or transcortex), drill contact (entrance or exit of the cortex), and total damage (both cortices). RESULTS: The drilling method (hand vs mechanical testing machine) had no effect on histologic damage, so results were analyzed by combining all data. The K-wire demonstrated the greatest area of cracks/damage compared to both standard surgical and acrylic drill bits, whereas no difference in damage was noted between the 2 drill bits for all variables. CONCLUSIONS: The K-wire and drill bits caused microdamage; K-wire drilling created more microdamage than drill bits. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The rabbit bone cortex is thin and brittle relative to dogs and cats, leading to failure during and after fracture fixation. The clinical failure of rabbit bone is at least partially caused by drill bits or K-wires causing microcracks.",

Understanding how sulfate (SO42‒) influences the conversion of inorganic mercury (Hg(II)) to toxic methylmercury (MeHg) is critical for predicting wetland responses to land use and climate change. Here, we sampled surface and pore waters across SO42‒ gradients in three freshwater Everglades wetlands to assess linkages between SO42‒, MeHg, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and inorganic sulfide (S(‒II)). Increasing SO42‒ concentrations increase S(‒II) and DOM concentrations and DOM aromaticity. MeHg concentration show a unimodal response to surface water SO42‒, which reflect high Hg(II) methylation at low-to-intermediate SO42‒concentration (2-12 mg/L) and low Hg(II) methylation at higher SO42‒concentrations ( > 12 mg/L). MeHg concentrations in surface waters correlate positively with MeHg concentrations in prey fish. The coherent biogeochemical relationships between SO42‒ and MeHg concentrations and biologic uptake improve MeHg risk assessment for aquatic food webs and are globally relevant due to anthropogenic and climate-driven increases in SO42‒.",

The most common emissions are carbon- or nitrogen-based pollutants that may impact diverse interactions between plants and insect herbivores. However, the effects of vehicle pollution on plant-insect interactions are poorly understood. Here, we combine a city-wide experiment across the Sacramento Metropolitan Area and a laboratory experiment to determine how vehicle emissions affect insect herbivory and leaf nutritional quality. We demonstrate that leaf damage to a native oak species (Quercus lobata) commonly planted across the western US is substantially elevated on trees exposed to vehicle emissions. In the laboratory, caterpillars preferred leaves from highway-adjacent trees and performed better on leaves from those same trees. Synthesis and applications. Together, our studies demonstrate that the heterogeneity in vehicle emissions across cities may explain highly variable patterns of insect herbivory on street trees. Our results also indicate that trees next to highways are particularly vulnerable to multiple stressors, including insect damage. To combat these effects, urban foresters may consider planting trees that are less susceptible to insect herbivory along heavily travelled roadways.",

We theorize that during a period of destigmatization, the effects of stigma persist more strongly for people stigmatized by association than for those directly stigmatized. We propose that this occurs because, during periods of destigmatization, conscious prejudice has diminished but nonconscious prejudice remains, so people correct for their explicit biases toward individuals with the stigmatizing trait but are unaware of their ongoing implicit prejudice toward those stigmatized by association. Our evidence comes from archival data on individual employment in film during the cold war years in Hollywood. It shows that as the stigma of being on an anticommunist blacklist weakened, the employment penalty for being a coworker of a blacklisted artist was greater than the penalty for actually having been on the blacklist itself. A supplemental experiment, designed to address the limitations of archival data, shows the same imbalanced employment penalties in another stigma currently undergoing destigmatization (that of physical disability). Paradoxically, as stigmas recede, harmful effects persist more for associates of stigmatized individuals than for the stigmatized themselves.",

      "abstract": "Crop rotation is one strategy for adapting agroecosystems to a framework that balances ecological diversity, sustainability, and food production. The Sacramento Valley, one of the most productive rice growing regions in the US, faces sustainability challenges including increasing herbicide resistant weed pressure and water use restrictions. Increasing crop diversity may help address these challenges, but this region has unique soil attributes including high clay content, salinity, alkalinity, and cemented subsurface layers, and the degree to which these soil properties influence crop rotation decisions remain unclear. The objectives of this study were to quantify the extent of crop rotation in this region, compare soil properties for rotated and continuous rice fields, and assess the potential for expanding rotations based on the geographic coverage of influential soil variables. Using satellite derived land cover data for 2007–2021, our analysis shows that only ∼5000 ha are in rotation with rice, while 220,000 ha are in continuous rice production. This land cover information is fused with SSURGO soil maps in a spatial random forest model. The modeling approach indicates that fields with soil pH between 6.5 and 8, EC between 0.5 and 2 (ds m-1), and saturated hydraulic conductivity less than 2 (μm s-1) are more likely to be rotated. However, we estimate that only 11% of the continuous rice area has all three of these soil properties combined, suggesting soil limitations are an important constraint. This research highlights a method for evaluating land use decisions in relation to spatial variability of soil properties to better understand barriers to agroecological diversification.",

      "abstract": "The injectable progestin depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is a popular contraceptive choice in sub-Saharan Africa although mouse models indicate it weakens genital epithelial integrity and barrier function and increases susceptibility to genital infection. The intravaginal ring NuvaRing® is another contraceptive option that like DMPA suppresses hypothalamic pituitary ovarian (HPO) axis function with local release of progestin (etonogestrel) and estrogen (ethinyl estradiol). As we previously reported that treating mice with DMPA and estrogen averts the loss of genital epithelial integrity and barrier function induced by DMPA alone, in the current investigation we compared genital levels of the cell-cell adhesion molecule desmoglein-1 (DSG1) and genital epithelial permeability in rhesus macaques (RM) treated with DMPA or a NuvaRing®re-sized for RM (N-IVR). While these studies demonstrated comparable inhibition of the HPO axis with DMPA or N-IVR, DMPA induced significantly lower genital DSG1 levels and greater tissue permeability to intravaginally administered low molecular mass molecules. By identifying greater compromise of genital epithelial integrity and barrier function in RM administered DMPA vs. N-IVR, our results add to the growing body of evidence that indicate DMPA weakens a fundamental mechanism of anti-pathogen host defense in the female genital tract.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Low bone mineral density is highly prevalent in sickle cell disease (SCD); whether bisphosphonates can safely preserve or increase bone mass in SCD adults remains unknown. In this study, lumbar spine bone density remained stable with alendronate use, and treatment-related side effects were mostly mild and self-limited. PURPOSE: To describe the effects of alendronate in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and osteoporosis. METHODS: We reviewed retrospective clinical data from adults with SCD and osteoporosis treated with alendronate at a single center in Brazil (2009-2019). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. We analyzed BMD changes by alendronate treatment duration (months), stratified by sex, skeletal site, and SCD genotype. RESULTS: Sixty-four SCD adults with osteoporosis (69% females, 73% HbSS, mean age ± standard deviation 42.4 ± 10.9 years) received alendronate for a median (interquartile range) of 48 (29, 73) months. Compared with males, females had significantly lower baseline BMD (g/cm2) at the femoral neck (0.72 vs 0.85, p =  < 0.001) and total hip (0.79 vs 0.88, p = 0.009). The between-sex differences in BMD changes were insignificant. Mean lumbar spine BMD significantly changed by 0.0357 g/cm2 (p = 0.028) in those on alendronate for > 5 years. Four adults (6.3%) reported mild therapy-related side effects. An atypical femoral diaphysis fracture, attributed to alendronate, was incidentally noted in a 37-year-old man on treatment for 4 years. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort of adults with SCD and osteoporosis on alendronate for a median of 48 months, we found no significant interactions between sex and changes in lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip BMD with alendronate. Lumbar spine BMD was stable in those on alendronate for < 5 years. Side effects of alendronate were mild, though one patient developed an atypical femoral fracture.",

Gross total resection was achieved in 9 patients. Patients with post resection residual tumor, high risk genomic features or disseminated disease were stratified as high risk. We treated all radiation eligible patients (n=13) per COG ACNS0332 maintenance chemotherapy regardless of risk group with 12/13 receiving radiosensitization (Vincristine/Carboplatin) and either 23.4 Gy/36 Gy CSI (two patients treated per Headstart3D2 and ACNS0334 respectively). 2 patients with spinal cord disease were treated with intrathecal topotecan and liposomal cytarabine respectively. During ACNS0332 maintenance bacteremia, weight loss and hypomagnesemia were frequent complications. 5 patients required chemotherapy dose reductions (4 Vincristine/1 Cisplatin). Two patients with LFS developed glioblastoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma following ACNS0332 therapy. Two patients (with WNT and NWNSHH subgroup tumors) experienced medulloblastoma relapse.

      "abstract": "Microinfarcts and microhemorrhages are characteristic lesions of cerebrovascular disease. Although multiple studies have been published, there is no one universal standard criteria for the neuropathological assessment of cerebrovascular disease. In this study, we propose a novel application of machine learning in the automated screening of microinfarcts and microhemorrhages. Utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) from postmortem human brain samples, we adapted a patch-based pipeline with convolutional neural networks. Our cohort consisted of 22 cases from the University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain bank with hematoxylin and eosin-stained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections across 3 anatomical areas: frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes (40 WSIs with microinfarcts and/or microhemorrhages, 26 without). We propose a multiple field-of-view prediction step to mitigate false positives. We report screening performance (ie, the ability to distinguish microinfarct/microhemorrhage-positive from microinfarct/microhemorrhage-negative WSIs), and detection performance (ie, the ability to localize the affected regions within a WSI). Our proposed approach improved detection precision and screening accuracy by reducing false positives thereby achieving 100% screening accuracy. Although this sample size is small, this pipeline provides a proof-of-concept for high efficacy in screening for characteristic brain changes of cerebrovascular disease to aid in screening of microinfarcts/microhemorrhages at the WSI level.",

By building on the UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) from its initial NIH funding in 2006, we created an institution-wide K scholar resource. We investigated subsequent NIH funding for K scholars and to what extent CTSC research resources were used. Using NIH RePORTER, we created a database of UC Davis investigators who obtained K01, K08, K23, K25, or K99, as well as institutional KL2 or K12 awards and tracked CTSC research resource use and subsequent funding success. Overall, 94 scholars completed K training between 2007 and 2020, of which 70 participated in one of four institutional, NIH-funded K programs. An additional 103 scholars completed a mentored clinical research training program. Of 94 K awardees, 61 (65%) later achieved NIH funding, with the majority receiving a subsequent individual K award. A higher proportion (73%) of funded scholars used CTSC resources compared to unfunded (48%). Biostatistics and Biomedical Informatics were most commonly used and 55% of scholars used one or more CTSC resource. We conclude that institutional commitment to create a K scholar platform and use of CTSC research resources is associated with high NIH funding rates for early career investigators.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Identification of patients with mTBI at risk for developing persistent-post concussive syndromes should begin during the ED/inpatient evaluation due to frequent lack of post-discharge follow-up. The best method for evaluating cognitive deficits in these acute settings and how to utilize this information to optimize follow-up care is a matter of ongoing research. In this descriptive study, we present the cognitive profile of 214 hospitalized patients with mTBI using a novel cognitive and behavioral screener, the UCD-Cog. METHOD: A retrospective review of patients with mTBI requiring hospitalization who were enrolled in the UC Davis TBI Registry over the course of 1 year. RESULTS: Reasoning, executive function, and delayed recall were the most frequently impaired cognitive domains. GCS 13-14 was associated with higher numbers of impaired cognitive domains and frequencies of impairments in domains traditionally associated with post-concussive symptoms. Patients with abnormal UCD-Cog results, regardless of GCS, were recommended higher levels of post-discharge care and supervision. CONCLUSION: Inpatient cognitive profiles using the UCD-Cog were consistent with evaluations during the subacute/chronic phase of mTBI and supports the clinical utility of acute cognitive screeners for mTBI management. Future studies will determine how the acute cognitive assessments correlate with long-term mTBI outcomes.",

We previously showed that low bone mineral density (BMD) independently associates with hip ON and chronic pain in a pediatric SCD cohort. We now present preliminary data on the association between low BMD and pain in a prospective cohort of adults enrolled in the SCD Bone Pain Study (NCT05283148).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, who were recruited from ambulatory adults with SCD seen at the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. All participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of their lumbar spine, left hip, and left forearm. Vertebral fractures were assessed by thoracolumbar morphometry in the DXA scanner. All participants also completed the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-Me) Pain Impact questionnaire. We used linear regression to evaluate the association between ASCQ-Me pain scores and low BMD (categorically defined as BMD Z-score ≤ -2 at any DXA site). We also used linear regression to determine the association between ASCQ-Me pain scores and continuous total hip and lumbar spine BMD Z-scores. Lastly, we evaluated the impact of other covariates on pain scores, with low BMD or BMD Z-scores included in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO, no shrinkage).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Thirty adults (median age 34.5 years [20-67 years]) completed the study between Nov 2022-Jul 2023. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. There was a borderline significant association between low BMD and lower (worse) pain scores (p=0.077). Continuous BMD Z-scores of the total hip (p=0.081) and lumbar spine (p=0.024) were independently associated with higher (better) pain scores. In addition to low BMD, only white blood cell count (WBC), indirect bilirubin, and vitamin D were identified as possible covariates (all had non-zero coefficients in LASSO analysis). Low BMD was significantly associated with pain (p=0.024), even after adjusting for WBC, indirect bilirubin, and vitamin D (Table 2). Similarly, we found that higher hip (p=0.059) and lumbar (p=0.027) BMD Z-scores were associated with higher (better) pain scores, despite adjusting for the same confounders.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Discussion:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We found low BMD in 12 of 30 (40%) adults enrolled in the SCD Bone Pain Study. Like other chronic hemolytic anemias, compensatory increased erythropoiesis leads to trabeculae degradation, cortical bone thinning, and eventual low bone mass. Lumbar vertebrae comprises mostly of trabecular bone, while the hip joint has mostly cortical bone. This might explain why mean lumbar BMD Z-scores were lower than hip BMD Z-scores (Table 1), and why lumbar spine BMD Z-scores directly and significantly correlated with pain scores (Table 2). These preliminary data suggest that pain is more prevalent in SCD adults with low BMD than those with normal BMD as we previously reported in a pediatric SCD cohort.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Pain scores decrease (worsen) with increasing WBC, which suggests an inflammatory component to chronic SCD pain. Contrary to expectation, higher indirect bilirubin (a marker of increased hemolysis) significantly correlated with higher (better) pain scores. Similarly, higher vitamin D (a proxy for bone health) correlated with lower (worse) pain scores, though this association was non-significant. The reason(s) for these counterintuitive associations between pain scores, indirect bilirubin, and vitamin D levels is currently unknown.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Limitations include a small sample size, though using the LASSO method for multivariate regression adjusted for this. Further, low BMD causality could not be determined at this time. Recruitment is ongoing with an enrollment target of 50 adults with SCD by Nov 2023. Analysis are ongoing to determine if SCD-modifying therapies will impact the association between low BMD and pain. Bone biomarker studies are also pending. Further, the thoracolumbar morphometry is still undergoing radiologic review, so we can further assess how vertebral compression fractures (i) correlate with pain scores, and/or (ii) attenuate the association between low BMD and pain. Identifying and treating risk factors for low BMD may alleviate bone pain and potentially improve quality of life for all people with SCD.</jats:p>",

ANIMALS: 50 healthy cats with > 1 kg body weight presenting for elective surgery. METHODS: In this randomized, prospective clinical trial, cats presenting to the University of California-Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital were assigned to receive buprenorphine 0.02 mg/kg IM followed by 1 of 2 oral sedation treatments: pregabalin 4 mg/kg or gabapentin 10 mg/kg. Cats were then anesthetized using a standardized protocol. Physical examination parameters and behavioral scores were measured by 2 treatment-blinded veterinarians to compare sedation levels before and after drug administration. Inadequate sedation for handling or IV catheter placement was addressed by dexmedetomidine administration. After surgery was completed, anesthesia recovery times and quality were assessed by the same veterinarians. The effects of pregabalin versus gabapentin on body temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were analyzed using Student t tests; behavioral assessments were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; and drug treatment effects on dexmedetomidine sedation rescue and frequency of delirium during anesthetic recovery were analyzed using Fisher exact tests. A P < .05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in change of physiologic parameters or sedation scores before and after sedation between groups. The need for rescue sedation for IV catheter placement and the incidence of emergence delirium were infrequent and similar for both treatments. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: At the doses studied, oral pregabalin and gabapentin produced indistinguishable effects as adjunctive perioperative sedation agents in cats.",

However, open access to reliable sources of well-characterized antibodies with unambiguous molecular identities remains an obstacle to research transparency and reproducibility. We propose here a community shift towards open-source antibodies, analogous to open-source computer software. The tenets of such antibodies are that 1) they are available to researchers in a ready to use form, 2) the renewable source of the antibody (e.g., hybridoma cells or plasmid) is also widely available ensuring reproducible and cost-effective access to the same antibody, and 3) the antibody sequence is publicly available. With these criteria met, the antibody can be widely used with the transparent assurance associated with a molecularly defined reagent, and the code can be edited to generate antibody variants to meet researchers' specific needs. We (the UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility, the Development Studies Hybridoma Bank, and Addgene) have established a consortium to provide open-source access to a large collection of well characterized antibodies. As open-source software has benefitted both users and developers, we suggest open-source antibodies will have a similar positive impact on antibody based biomedical research. We encourage funding agencies to support initiatives to expand access to open-source antibody resources, and researchers to both utilize and to contribute to them, with a goal of enabling more reliable and cost-effective pursuit of research.",

Blood samples were obtained from 52 canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) that were captured on San Francisco Bay, California, during December 2017 as part of a long-term study. Reference values and clinical agreement were determined for blood chemistry and plasma protein parameters among four commonly used point-of-care devices (VetScan® VS2, i-STAT®, AlphaTRAK®2 glucometer, refractometer) and two gold standard laboratory analyzers (Roche cobas® c501, Helena SPIFE 3000 system). Canvasback reference values were generally within expected ranges for Anatidae species with the exception of higher upper limits for sodium and chloride. Creatine kinase and aspartate transaminase values exceeded a published threshold for diagnosis of capture myopathy even though study birds were captured using low-stress techniques and successfully released. With the exception of higher alkaline phosphatase in hatch-year canvasbacks, no age or sex differences were observed for any analyte in this population that was captured during a nonbreeding period. Analysis of analyzer agreement found raw VetScan aspartate transaminase, calcium, glucose, and uric acid values; corrected VetScan albumin, potassium, sodium, and total protein values; raw i-STAT glucose and potassium values; and corrected i-STAT sodium and chloride values were clinically interchangeable with Roche cobas values. Raw VetScan and i-STAT glucose values were also interchangeable. However, none of the Roche or point-of-care analyzer plasma protein values were in clinical agreement with gold standard electrophoresis values. The findings of this study highlight the need for analyzer- or technique-specific reference values and provide biologists and veterinarians quantitative reference values using currently available analyzers to better assess and respond to the health of individuals and populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dengue is a leading cause of morbidity throughout the tropics; however, accurate population-based estimates of mortality rates are not available. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We established the Enhanced Fatal Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance System (EFASS) to estimate dengue mortality rates in Puerto Rico. Healthcare professionals submitted serum and tissue specimens from patients who died from a dengue-like acute febrile illness, and death certificates were reviewed to identify additional cases. Specimens were tested for markers of dengue virus (DENV) infection by molecular, immunologic, and immunohistochemical methods, and were also tested for West Nile virus, Leptospira spp., and other pathogens based on histopathologic findings. Medical records were reviewed and clinical data abstracted. A total of 311 deaths were identified, of which 58 (19%) were DENV laboratory-positive. Dengue mortality rates were 1.05 per 100,000 population in 2010, 0.16 in 2011 and 0.36 in 2012. Dengue mortality was highest among adults 19-64 years and seniors ≥65 years (1.17 and 1.66 deaths per 100,000, respectively). Other pathogens identified included 34 Leptospira spp. cases and one case of Burkholderia pseudomallei and Neisseria meningitidis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: EFASS showed that dengue mortality rates among adults were higher than reported for influenza, and identified a leptospirosis outbreak and index cases of melioidosis and meningitis.",

Here, we describe four fatal cases of Leptospira species/dengue virus co-infection in Puerto Rico. Although all patients sought care early, antibiotic administration was delayed for most. Steroids were administered to all patients, in most cases before antibiotics. These cases show the need for clinicians evaluating patients in or recently returned from the tropics with acute febrile illness to consider both dengue and leptospirosis. Furthermore, they illustrate the need for nucleic acid- or antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests to enable timely patient diagnosis and management. In particular, antibiotic therapy should be initiated early for patients with suspected leptospirosis, and steroids should not be administered to patients with suspected dengue.",

      "abstract": "Public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek novel ways to understand pathogen infection in native, wildlife hosts. With its deep history of tools and perspectives for understanding the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can shed new light on viral infection dynamics. However, datasets allowing deep explorations of viral communities from an ecological perspective are lacking. We sampled 1086 bats from two, adjacent Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection by herpesviruses, resulting in 3131 short, viral sequences. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm (affinity propagation), we categorized herpesviruses into 43 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to be used in place of species in subsequent ecological analyses. Herpesvirus metacommunities demonstrated long-tailed rank frequency distributions at all analyzed levels of host organization (i.e., individual, population, and community). Although 13 herpesvirus OTUs were detected in more than one host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a single core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all satellite species combined. We describe the natural history of herpesvirus metacommunities in Puerto Rican bats and suggest that viruses follow the general law that communities comprise few common and many rare species. To guide future efforts in the field of viral ecology, hypotheses are presented regarding mechanisms that contribute to these patterns.",

We describe clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings in individuals who died following chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. METHODS: We identified individuals who died in Puerto Rico during 2014 following an acute illness and had CHIKV RNA detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a pre- or postmortem blood or tissue specimen. We performed histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CHIKV antigen on tissue specimens and collected medical data via record review and family interviews. RESULTS: Thirty CHIKV-infected fatal cases were identified (0.8/100 000 population). The median age was 61 years (range: 6 days-86 years), and 19 (63%) were male. Death occurred a median of 4 days (range: 1-29) after illness onset. Nearly all (93%) had at least 1 comorbidity, most frequently hypertension, diabetes, or obesity. Nine had severe comorbidities (eg, chronic heart or kidney disease, sickle cell anemia) or coinfection (eg, leptospirosis). Among 24 fatal cases with tissue specimens, 11 (46%) were positive by IHC. CHIKV antigen was most frequently detected in mesenchymal tissues and mononuclear cells including tissue macrophages, blood mononuclear cells, splenic follicular dendritic cells, and Kupffer cells. Common histopathologic findings were intra-alveolar hemorrhage and edema in the lung, chronic or acute tenosynovitis, and increased immunoblasts in the spleen. CHIKV infection likely caused fatal septic shock in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of tissue specimens provided insights into the pathogenesis of CHIKV, which may rarely result in septic shock and other severe manifestations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent placement in infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow is being increasingly used in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To correlate computed tomographic (CT) angiography morphology and length of the PDA with catheter angiography and its relation to eventual PDA stent length. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified all pediatric patients who underwent PDA stenting at our institute from 2004 to 2018. We included children who had CT angiography prior to stenting. PDA length was measured by a radiologist blinded to the catheter angiography data, using Syngo-via post-processing software (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Vessel centerline technique was used. We measured the actual length of the duct as well as straight length between aortic and pulmonary ends. PDA morphology tortuosity index was classified as straight (Type I), mildly tortuous with 1 turn (Type II) and tortuous with >1 turn (Type III), and the PDA origin was noted. The PDA was also measured and morphology classified on catheter angiography by an interventional cardiologist blinded to the CT angiography findings. We compared the CT angiography and catheter angiography lengths, straight lengths and stent length using scatter plots and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: A total of 83 children who had PDA stenting were identified, of whom 17 had prior CT angiography. Fifteen of these were neonates. There was agreement between CT angiography and catheter angiography regarding the PDA morphology tortuosity index in 94% of cases and PDA origin in 100% of cases. There was moderate agreement between CT angiography and catheter angiography actual and straight PDA lengths, with ICC coefficients of 0.65 and 0.68, respectively. There was moderate agreement between CT angiography actual length, CT angiography straight length, catheter angiography actual length and eventual stented PDA length, with ICCs of 0.57, 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. There was poor agreement between catheter angiography straight length and eventual stented PDA length, with an ICC of 0.39. CONCLUSION: PDA length and morphology description on CT angiography correlates well with catheter angiography and can be a reliable guide for the interventional cardiologist in decision-making regarding appropriate choice of PDA stent length.",

      "abstract": "Agricultural phosphorus (P) loss, which is highly variable in space and time, has been studied using the hot spot/hot moment concept, but increasing the rigor of these assessments through a relatively newer \"ecosystem control point\" framework may help better target management practices that provide a disproportionate water quality benefit. Sixteen relatively large (0.85 ha) subsurface drainage plots in Illinois were used as individual observational units to assess dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations and losses within a given field over four study years. Three plot-months were identified as DRP control points (one export and two transport control points), where each plot-month contributed >10% of the annual DRP load from the field. These control points occurred on separate plots and in both the growing and nongrowing seasons but were likely related to agronomic P applications. Elevated soil test P, especially near a historic farmstead, and soil clay content were spatial drivers of P loss across the field. The nongrowing season was hypothesized to be the most significant period of P loss, but this was only documented in two of the four study years. A cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop did not significantly reduce DRP loss in any year, but there was also no evidence of increased drainage P losses due to freezing and thawing of the cover crop biomass. This work confirmed annual subsurface drainage DRP losses were agronomically small (<3% of P application rate), although the range of DRP concentrations relative to eutrophication criteria still demonstrated a potential for negative environmental impact. The control point concept may provide a new lens to view drainage DRP losses, but this framework should be refined through additional within-field studies because mechanisms of P export at this field were more nuanced than just the presence of tile drainage (i.e., a transport control point).",

      "abstract": "There is consensus that under-ice circulation presents multiple phases through the winter, and that different mechanisms dominate each period. In this work, measurements of temperature, water velocity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen from Lake Massawippi, Quebec, Canada, obtained during the ice-covered season in 2019, were used to characterize the time scales of different winter regimes and transitions among dominating circulation mechanisms. Lake circulation during this period began with a single-cell convection induced by sediment flux pulses in early winter. The single-cell convection decayed into a brief quiescent period. Radiatively driven convection then formed a convectively mixed layer in late winter. The defined mixed layer and temperature structure provided the necessary conditions for the formation of a potential rotational feature, which briefly formed immediately prior to ice break-up. Ice break-up led to complex hydrodynamics that persisted for nearly 28 days following full ice-off. Dissolved oxygen was directly correlated with the varying circulation features throughout the field campaign. This work provides a quantitative measure to delineate the transitions between under-ice regimes and provides novel insights into the subsequent circulation during and after ice break-up.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) in India is 11%, which is one of the highest rates globally. Existing research on HDPs in India primarily focuses on biological risk factors, with minimal research on how socioecological factors combine to increase risk of HDPs. We conducted a rapid review using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model to understand the social and cultural factors associated with HDPs among Indian pregnant women to identify possible intervention targets that may uniquely improve health in this population. Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model is a framework that can be used to understand the complex relationship between multiple influences on health. METHODS: We reviewed studies published between January 2010 and January 2024 using PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. Search terms included variants of hypertension, pregnancy, and India. Inclusion criteria were: (1) peer-reviewed journal article; (2) published between January 2010 to January 2024; (3) participants consisted of Indian women living in India; (4) studies evaluated socioecological risk factors associated with HDPs. One independent reviewer performed searches, screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. Each included study was then organized within Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model. RESULTS: A total of 921 studies were generated from the initial search, with 157 exclusions due to duplicates. Following screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria at the title/abstract and full text levels, 17 studies remained in the final review. Socioecological risk factors of HDPs were identified at each level, with the most commonly identified influences including: low socioeconomic status (SES), lacking community education and knowledge on HDP management and prevention, and lacking prenatal HDP screening. CONCLUSION: This study determined that the high risk for HDPs in India is influenced by many intertwined socioecological factors. Women in rural and low SES areas need more health education on HDP management and prevention. There also needs to be more adequate prenatal HDP screening, with at least 4 and ideally 8 prenatal visits. Prenatal screenings should be accompanied with culturally appropriate patient education, especially for low SES women who have limited literacy, so that they can effectively make individual and microsystemic lifestyle decisions aimed at either managing or preventing HDPs.",
